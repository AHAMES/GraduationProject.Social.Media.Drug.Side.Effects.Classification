Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi. I've been taking Lisinopril 40mg; and crazy dizziness and headaches occurred and brought my blood pressure down to around 90/50; so my doctor had me take only 20mg lisinopril per day. With 20mg; my blood pressure was constantly at 160-170/100. Then; the doctor told me to take Atenolol 25mg at night and lisinopril 20mg in the morning. It brought my blood pressure down to around 100/60 regularly; but recently it started going up again. I often have electric tingling/weakness in my hands/arms/legs and feel like I will faint. Blood pressure fluctuates from 160/100 to 100/60 from one day to another. Doctor thinks I have panic attack and should take Xanax for it. But; I feel like the medication combination (atenolol/lisinopril) is giving me hard time. I asked doctor to please change the medication but he refuses; and he thinks it's the anxiety attack that's the cause for all this. What should I do? Is Lisinopril/Atenolol a proven combination to help hypertension? Thanks.,2010,2010,49,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have a choice to choose between Lisinopril or Ramipril (I know latter works in lower doses). But which one is more effective in this condition?,2011,2011,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,if lisinopril and cozaar aren't working to lower bp in combo with atenolol and hctz; in fact either causes higher bp and not feeling well; what is another possible choice,2014,2014,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I believe I suffer from white coat hypertension. Earlier (until a year ago); when I didn't care about my blood pressure; I always had excellent results when my doctor measured it (115-120/60-70). After I started worrying about my heart (not so much anymore; I usually try my best to help people on the heart rhythm community) my BP readings are higher. I feel my muscles get tense and my heart starts pounding when the cuff inflates; and blood pressure is 140-155/80-95. At home; I get similar symptoms on the first measuring; but it resolves and gradually slows to 120/70 after some tries. I measured it one weekend after a good night of sleep and it was 105/55. I was completely relaxed; for once; at that time. What is quite strange; is that I imagine this started when I started using propranolol (20 mg) for PACs and sinus tachycardia. After this; my heart didn't race when I got scared; but beat harder instead. When I was really scared; I actually had bradycardia; but I got a strange sensation that my blood vessels were constricted (may be imagination..) I got my beta blocker changed to metoprolol (25 mg) and I feel my anxiety getting a bit stronger. But now my heart races a bit more in response to anxiety. Can propranolol actually contribute to higher blood pressure with stress? Are my assumptions correct that propranolol works better on anxiety due to the non-selective effect? Is my BP really normal? My heart is otherwise fine with normal chambers; wall dimensions and excellent contractility (EF 78%). I have some PACs but I'm otherwise healthy; exercise 3 times/week and normal weight. Thanks in advance!,2009,2011,29,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I can't sleep and was up thinking. As I said before; I just started getting the symptoms that everyone is experiencing 6 months ago around the time that I started taking Lisinopril-HCTZ for my high blood pressure. I was told by my primary doctor that Lisinopril-HCTZ was a water pill and that it was safe and a low dosage. After going to the emergency several times for a tickle on one side and sometime on both sides of my throat; coughing; watery eyes; and running nose; the emergency doctor asked me if I ever had COPD. I explained to him that I had never had any illnesses except High Blood Pressure; which was diagnosed around 6 months ago. The Emergency doctor kept questioning me about the time I starting Lisinopril-HCTZ and the time my symptoms started. He told my to stop taking Lisinopril-HCTZ and to call the hospitial today for a physcian. He also said that one of the side effect of Lisinopril-HCTZ is a dry cough. Once I arrived home I decided to took up the side effects of Lisinopril and found that it is not a water pill after all. I am wondering if Lisinopril-HCTZ can some how be contributed to my symptoms.,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril. About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG; X-rays; MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and gave me one dose of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist. Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg); Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment. Thanks.,2014,2014,69,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,The patient (50 years old) had a very high systolic pressure ranging 180-210 mmHg. Used Lisinopril for 4 days in this way: 20 mg in 7 am ; and 20 mg Lisinopril in 7 pm (so total = 40 mg Lisinopril per day). During the day (systolic) hypertension goes 150-160 mmHg and only in 2-4pm it is 130 mmHg (and at 10-12 pm). What should be done for this patient. Maybe trying a diuretic (hydrochlorthiazid) and lowering the dose of Lisinopril? Please tell what do you think of the doses to start trying; how often and when during the day? (P.S. if you think of another drug/combination may be more effective trying; it would be a great help).,2011,2011,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; thank you for taking the time to answer this question. I have been diagnosed with Mitral Valve Leakage. I do not know the specific RF numbers associated with this. I read via the net that in time either mitral valve repair or replacement may be needed. The Cardiologist I am seeing has placed me on 5mg of Lisinoril. I am wondering if this is a theorpy for deplaying surgery or is it a long term plan to treat the leakage. I am also on 25mg Metoprolol twice daily. I will be having a heart cath in 2 weeks to investigate the valve further and to rule out any other damage. Please advise of the results of other Lisinopril treatment history. Thanks....G,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I take lisinopril every morning does anyone know if I can take bynadryl?? I just don't want to have an interaction....,2007,2012,32,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I don't think my fathers doctor is being informative enough; but I just got my dad blood lab results and the main concern was his cholesterol; but the doctor felt he needed lisinopril 2.5mg ( very small dose ) to protect his kidneys. what numbers on a lab test would you look at to determine if kidneys needs protection? His blood pressure is fine and he is not dx diabetic ; so is their a need for ace inhibitors. What do md look for that is a clear sign the kidney is failing?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi everyone; I was recently in the ER because I felt a consistent fluttering in my chest which later turned out to be PVCs. The ER kept me in; monitored me for 18 hours; and I seem to have averaged around 3-7 PVCs per minute for all of my waking hours there. This was a totally new experience for me. In the past I had felt this flutter maybe 3 or 4 times a year for about 15-30 seconds total and therefore didn't know what it was. I am in my early 50s. The tests showed no signs of MI; thryoid appeared good; and the echocardiogram was perfectly normal. So I was sent home and basically told not to worry about it. Now; I did mention the docs that about 5 days prior to this event; my GP had doubled my lisinopril from 20 mg. to 40 mg; once a day. I also take 200 mg Toprol. I am not taking a diuretic because the darn stuff was making me 'go' 15 times a day. So the Toprol and then Lisinopril was used for my hypertension. At the moment my hypertension is not as well controlled as I'd like with these two meds. I am quite overweight and struggling to lose it (I've lost about 8-10 lbs in the last few weeks) with slow progress so getting that part of my life under control is going to take time. I am aware that this could have happened coincidentally; and had nothing to do with my lisinopril being increased. But I'd like to know if it's possible that this could be the culprit.,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi I have a history of high blood pressure. Three months ago I was put on Lisinopril 10mg. So now my Dr. wants me to try 5mg. I have a few questions. Does 5mg really work for high blood pressure? I have never really hurd of anyone taking 5mg of lisinopril for high blood pressure. Will my body withdraw or need to adjust to a lower dose? Thank you an advance.,2010,2013,30,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am currently taking Lisinopril; 20mg. I take Lisinopril in a.m. without other drugs; vitamins. Within 2 hours and continues throughout the day; I am having overall weakness; cough; dizziness; legs feel like they are shaking inside; although not externally visible. B/P is sometimes 170 / 90 and other times 125 / 70 and anywhere in-between. Is there some other drug to control hypertension which does not have these side effects?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 55 years old and all my life I have had low blood pressure my entire life; 103/63; 99/65; 102/68; 102/64; 116/70. Two months ago my blood pressure was 102/68 and now I have had readings of 127/ ; 133; and 133. I can't remember the bottom numbers. I am alarmed but the doctor told me it is a normal consequence of aging. I can feel my heart working harder. The only test I have that comes out high normal is thyroid TSH at a range of 3.65-7.00. I am not taking thyroid medicine at this time. What do you think has happened in a two month period to cause this change?,2006,2007,55,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I started having BP issues after I had my kids. I have been on the highest dose of Azor; benicar and would get so/so bp but my pulse was high and I was always out of breath. I switched to 10mg of lisinopril with a low dose diuretic and it seems to be ok over all; but I will get readings in the doctors office such as 164/108. At home it's much lower and sometimes when I wake up it's 108/85. When I have a headache or sick my bp spikes to 180/110. My husband has been in pain from surgeries etc.. and his bo never spikes like mine. This new doc suggested a beta blocker but I really want to avoid taking those. He doesn't seem to really care about my health history and I think he just pushes pills and wants his patents out the door. Am I doomed to have uncontrollable BP all my life or is there a med that can help me? I am afraid I will stroke out one day while going out doing activities unknowingly with my bp spiking 200/110.,2012,2013,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi! I'm a 21 year old female who just got back from overseas. While abroad; it was discovered; from a visit to the doctor for an ear infection; that I had high blood pressure. I visited the doctor twice for the ear infection. The first time; I had normal bp; but the second showed an elevated bp and pulse (though he thought at the time that it was due to my taking Claritin-D). I have since stopped taking Claritin-D; but the bp never went down. My most recent reading (about 3 months ago) was 140/95; but the previous 4 before that averaged around 150/85. While overseas; I had the usual blood tests and 24-hr urine; but that showed nothing. I was then referred to a cardiologist; had an EKG and renal ultrasound; (which I assume were both normal since I never heard anything back). I have since returned to the US; so I was never able to complete the other tests (echo; 24-bp monitoring; Holter monitoring) which the cardiologist recommended. I have not been to a doctor in the US since returning because of busy schedule (college and work). How worried should I be about this? Is this something that needs to be taken care of right away or can it wait? What are the likely causes of this sudden change in bp? If I discover that my bp has dropped since returning to the US; is it still an issue? Thanks so much!,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; Feeling dreadful but relieved the doctor's found the cause: hypothyroid (TSH 5.41; T3 2.5; T4 10.6) and started yesterday on levothyroxine 50ug. My Mum's got the same thing and takes 150ug levothyroxine after being diagnosed 12 years ago. My blood pressure's 175/115 and my pulse is 95. Any little thing makes be feel panicky but before all this I was a happy; calm person. Family all has low-normal blood pressure; and my triglycerides are too LOW: 0.53 g/l when the minimum should be 0.7 g/l. Cholesterol normal. Done an internet search and found that hypothyroid can cause hypertension because lack of thyroid leads to loss of strength in the heart; and stiffening of the blood vessels. So; added to this I'm asthmatic; (since age 3; now 43) and take seretide. The asthma's under control. Medicines: Seretide once a day. Since last week I'm on half a beta-blocker at night and calcium-blocker in the morning to reduce blood pressure; and it's helping: panic feeling's gone; pressure was 145/95 yesterday. Since yesterday 50ug levothyroxine; which will probably be increased next month I expect after blood tests to see how it's working. QUESTIONS: Are these medicines okay together; and how long does it take to feel better? I'm a zombie at present; can hardly get out of bed; am freezing cold etc I'm desperate for improvement. Thank you so much for your time; advice and help.,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a professional violinist and recently developed an essential tremor in my bow arm which interferes greatly with my playing. My neurologist tried primidone but it has helped only a little. I asked if he could put me on Inderal which I understand can help with essential tremor. However -- the doctor pointed out that I am already on lisinopril (for hypertension) which; he claimed; ALSO is effective in treating essential tremor. So the upshot was that according to him; there was 'no point' in substituting Inderal for the Lisinopril I'm already taking since Lisinopril is JUST AS EFFECTIVE in treating essential tremor as Inderal. But is this right?? I've read about lisinopril and see no mention whatsoever of its being helpful for essential tremor (Of course I know it's effective for high blood pressure),2008,2008,64,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been taking Lisinopril for 2 years and since then my resting heart rate is between 90-100. Here recently though after I take Lisinopril it has jumped to 130 when walking 100 when resting. I take Lisinopril in the morning and my pulse jumps but at night it gos back to being okay (Lisinopril's half life is 12 hours). I haven't taken today because I was out but my resting pulse is 90 and when I went to WalMart it went no higher than 110 unlike 140 yesterday. I am a 24 overweight male 5'4" 190 and I am out of shape. I was taking supplements with the Lisinopril (Fish Oil; Coq10; Vitamin C; Folic Acid) and my heart rate was actually normal for 5 months but I stopped taking them after I encountered Gastritis (deemed later viral). I have 7 EKG's done even when my pulse shot up to 160 last week and all Sinus Tach. Cardiac Enzyme test was normal and chest Xray showed no enlarged heart or arteries. My cholesterol is also slight elevated. MY bp off the Lisinopril is 145/85 and I see a cardiologist for the first time on Wednesday is it safe for me not to take the Lisinopril till then? MY kidneys are also fine and my Liver. Why would Lisinopril cause the Tach and then sudden increase. Asked a Pharmacist and he said that it is a downplayed side effect of Ace Inhibitors that it does happen. My Blood Pressure has been around normal all day the highest is 135/80 when I eat and my pulse is around 90-100 now 3rd day off of Lisinopril.,2009,2009,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I had some blood tests last month; my Total Cholesterol was 292. (200 being normal) I also have hypertension in the past years. Are hypertension and cholesterol connected? I know that bad cholesterol can form clots in the arteries and raise blood pressure.... but If I lower the cholesterol level (which I have been doing the past month) will it help to lower blood pressure also or will the clots remain in the arteries and still have high bp?,2018,2018,35,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had type 1 Diabetes for 21 years. For the last five years I've had excellent control. I've had two healthy babies and an A1C of 5.0-6.5. Unfortunately I've had more years out of control than in control. Today my lab results showed protien in my urine. I am not taking this well; even though I knew it was inevitible because of my history. My Doctor has perscribed Lisinopril after I have my third child. My questions are: Are there many type 1 who have to be on this type of pill for life? Is there a way to stop the protien from spilling over even with good A1C? I feel like this is the beginning of a long road of battles. Like it's all downhill complications from here. Is this accurate? So far I've been very healthy; am I a walking time bomb? Any words of comfort yet real truths would be appreciated. Thanks,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been being treated with atenolol then started lisinopril @ 10mg; upped to 20 then 40mg over the last 2 months with no change in my BP. It is still 160/100 range. Is it likely I will show a response to these meds over the next several weeks? Are some people just resistant to the meds? Thank you.,2012,2012,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 72 y.o. male; have been taking Lisinopril for at least two years in the a.m. with no other drugs or vitamins.

Could you suggest a substitute that does not have these side effects?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,On Aug. 7; 2009 I had a dual chamber; rate adaptive pacemaker implanted. The surgery was successful; but I became hypertensive within 12 hours after the implant with a reading of 160+/80 which rose to 203/93. I was given medication to reduce my blood pressure which did eventually drop to about 145/75 . I was discharged and prescribed 10 mg. of Lisinopril daily. However; my bp has remained high at 177-155/93-74. Before the implant it was 140-125/70-62. The pacemaker is set to pace at 50-130 bpm. Has anyone had a similar experience of their bp undergoing a significant increase in bp after an implant and; if so; what was done to overcome the increase ? I would appreciate a comment from anyone on this. I will be seeing the cardiologist on Aug. 19. Thanks in advance for your help. AAF,2009,2009,78,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Today I saw a new doctor for the first time. She mentioned that my BP was very high. ( 158 over 90 )I have noticed since December a rise in my blood pressure; but nowhere this high. However prior to that it was quite low; usually no higher than 120 over 70. She has prescribed Lisinopril 10mg. I have never been one to take any kind of medication. So I am a bit weary of this. This was the first time I saw her; and I know I have anxiety problems. I mentioned it to her; but she said "we need to get it down now". Is it safe to be taking this medication without further monitoring?,2007,2009,60,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 26yo Male 6'1" 205 good health. Fall 2006 went into ER for Migrains discoverd BP was 172/102; come to find out later after constant migraines ( that I thought were related to hypoglycemia ) were due to pulmunary hypertension. I went to my DO he and he didnt seem to have an issue with a 26yo male having a BP on a 24/hr avg 166/96; so I asked for a refferal to a cardiologist. Later I had a workup done follwoing a CT; Renal Duplex study and a Agiogram ( because they thought i had bi-lateral renal aterie stenosis; which I did'nt) Only in my Ciliac Axis was there stenosis found with an 80% occulusion. I was taking Lisinopril after having a cough I had been taken off the ACE inhibitor; now I take Hayzaar 50 12.5; on avg my B/P is 148/88. Only a daily baisis i'm borderline tachycardic 98-116. When excersising I avg 166 HR; which worries me. if I get down or lay in certain positions it feels like my head is gonna explode; and even sometime while ambulating. I don'y want kidney failure nor do I want to be stuck on meds my remainder; Does anyone have feedback on what it might be; should I have a stress echo or have my adrenal cortex checked along with my thyroid? I want to trouble shoot my disease because it prevents me from daily excersising. I also read a few blurps about chronic depleation or dehydration can cause hypertension in my case I drink less than a dialysis pt; lol because either i forget or don't thirst.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real "symptoms" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the "silent killer". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its "gentle". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now. Thanks for your time,2018,2018,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you. I was recently diagnosed with #1 Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension #2 Essential hypertension; by two PH specialists at a PH Clinic. I had an exercise echocardiogram with PP's of 32mm at rest increasing to 60mm on exercise. My systemic BP also increased from 160/80 at rest up to 180/105 on exertion. I did a 6-minute walk where my initial BP was 142/100; 175/110 at completion of 1580 feet. I was extremely nervous during all these events. The diagnoses was that my PH is related to my high BP being inadequately controlled - Cardizem CD 120mg qd + 325mg aspirin; with my BP on average 142/75 at home. So; the Cardizem was increased to 320mg qd; with the understanding that after follow-up with my (new) doctor 2 weeks hence; if my BP was still high then this dosage should be increased or a second agent added. (Other tests were done during my two days at the clinic; but no RH cath.) On follow-up with my PCP; Cardizem was reduced to 120 mg qd PM and Lisinopril 2.5 mg added AM. I also continue to take 325mg aspirin AM and Lipitor 10mg PM. My question: I recently have been experiencing muscle pain in both the upper and lower portions of my arms - mostly the right arm - pain which comes and goes in frequency and level; PM on average the worst. Is this something I need worry about? I am due to revisit the doctor in three months. I have previously posted here; on the initial diagnosis; of pulmonary hypertension. MBT,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension 15 days ago. I was first put on Lisinopril which after 10 days did not bring my blood pressure down. At which point my doctor wanted to put me on Coreg CR. I have asthma; and have been suffering somewhat from shortness of breath so I had concerns being put on a beta blocker. So he put me on Norvasc. I have been on that since May 29th. My blood pressures are still running somewhat high at times. The problem is the diastolic and the heart rate. Earlier today it was 144/102 but at that point my heart rate was 73. Some of my recent readings are 141/101 pulse of 104: 129/104 with a pulse of 90; 137/102 with a pulse of 102. I have a couple of questions. 1) is it a danger when the systolic minus the diastolic are less than 40 in difference? 2) I did not get to see my physician but did see the PA...and I told her that there is a history of strokes (dad; sister) in my family. And told her that was a concern; is it? She did not seem to think so. My chest does not feel normal. Could that be due to the changes with the hypertension and the medications? I did make an appointment with a cardiologist; but it is not until the 10th. Thanks for your time; Concerned,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I just got recently diagnosed with Adult ADHD and started the treatment process. My doctor put me on adderall XR Oral (but on the bottle it says amphetamine salts). I know that there is usually a feeling out process when it comes to ADHD and the various treatments. However; I have hypertension and in my research; I've noticed that this is not recommended for people with hypertension. I started taking it on Saturday and noticed that my blood pressure; (that I was being treated for with atenlol and lisinopril) shot up to about 160/100 on average. This has me obviously concerned. I've noticed the difference in my overall behavior and concentration but the spike in blood pressure makes me nervous. So my questions are this: 1. (and I think I know the answer to this) should I really be concerned yet? 2. Are there recommended treatments for people with ADHD and hypertension? 3. What medications should I look into with my physician? 4. Could increaseing my dosage on my blood pressure medication maybe reduce the effect of the adderall? 5. Is there any blood pressure medication that could help? Thanks.,2009,2009,36,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello everybody. I would like to have some hypertension success stories. It is important to me - to know that anyone did this! Please... Please; write HOW did you succeed with your hypertension.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I have previously been drinking any types of tea and have had no coughs and colds. However; I notice that eversince I've been on hypertension medication; I have been having coughs and colds after drinking tea. It takes a very long time to cure. Is there any feedback or research done where I can get some clarification on the side effects of drinking tea with hypertention medication? Please advise. Thank you.,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had a fib episodes for 30 yrs. First lanoxin; then tenormin and after a few cardioverts; now sotalol. I have been episode free for 2 yrs but have always had a pressure on my chest that comes and goes. This time I though it was a heart attack ; ended up in ER; BP was soaring but strip looked good. My cardiologist was called he decided t admit me to chek it all out. I had stress echo which then led to cath . Conclusion is that there are no blockages(less than 10%) but I have very thick heart muscle and pain may be from blood not getting through fas enough. Also found that I had very high internal heart pressures. I am now on lisinopryl; taztia and lasix when previously my BP was described as a high normal; in the 130's range. My pressure while using the meds is anywhere from 140-170 /68 with pulse of 66. I feel lousy; headachy; still have chest titenes occassionaly and no energy. I still take the sotalol twice a day. Can you explain how this can happen so quickly; and if this all makes sense to you and what the prognosis isbecause I dont understand it at all. Also I take stalol and lasix in AM. taztia at noon; and sotalol and lisinopril in eveneing (12hrs from prev). I am 63 and weigh 280 at 73" tall.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have posted on this forum in the past in regard to my "unexplained" LAD blockage and subsequent CABG. At age 54 after 30 years of very active running and cycling; I was diagnosed with a blockage of the LAD at the bifurcation. The only symptoms I was having was shortness of breath in the first 1/4 mile or so of my daily runs.Presumably; this was due to my fairly extensive collateral network. My risk profile appeared to be benign with LDL of 130; HDL 60; never smoked; not diabetic; and normal ambient blood pressure. Family history was not perfect as father had CABG at age 68 after lifetime of smoking. Mother well at 82. I did find post surgery that my homocysteine was high. In a stress test some months prior to the blockage diagnosis it was reported that the test was terminated due to exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise. I was never told of this. Peak systolic pressure reached 230mm at about 15 METs. More recently; I was found to have LVH with septal wall of 15mm. It reversed to 11mm after 8 months of 5mg of lisinopril. I have now run into an an article documenting severe atheroscherosis and calification in a 30 year marathon runner with exercise induced hypertension with an otherwise "clean" risk profile (Am J Cardiol 2007;99:743-744). Is it possible that this exercise induced hypertension is what is behind my otherwise unexplained disease? Do I need to quit running? With statin therapy; my LDL is now 88 and I am on a low dose of Toprol XL for occational Afib.,2003,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My husband sweats a lot when exercising and playing golf. He takes Lisinopril and he has had several episodes of lightheadedness; nausea and vomiting; and low BP while playing golf. Are there other classes of anti-hypertensives that don't result in hypotension DT excessive sweating? He's also had 7 kidney stones in the last 5 months. Could Lisinopril and his excessive sweating be a contributing factor?,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 63 yr old female who has recently been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and hypertension. I haven't really experienced any overt symptoms of hypothyroidism beyond dry skin and possibly "brain fog" (after reading some of the comments of other posts - I think I can identify with that!). My TSH was extremely high (52 -- normal lab values to 2.5) and can't figure out why I didn't have more symptoms. My BP in Dr's office was very high - 177/90. Since then I have followed it at home for a week and have found only about 1 high reading a day of about 136/79 with 4 or 5 readings of about 117/74 with occasionally much lower readings. I've been on Lisinopril 20mg for 7 days and Levothyroxin 50 mcg for 4 days and feel "strange"-- sometimes light-headed and weak. Is it possible to connect the elevated BP and hypothyroidism and is it possible to have a TSH value that high and not experience more hypothyroid symptoms? I am otherwise healthy although 40# overweight and have suffered from venous insufficiency (varicose veins - with much inflammation and painful ulcers) all my life.,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I've read reports that lisinopril (which I take for hypertension) is being studied as a possible MS med. Do any of you also take lisinopril? If so; have you experienced possible MS benefits? My MRIs have remained unchanged for several years . . . . maybe lisinopril is connected; or maybe that is just how things were going to roll anyway. Just curious; Sherry,2007,2011,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been suffering from pulsing in my vision for several years now. It began when I was 14; and has continued since then (I am currently 17). I am able to see veins/blood vessels in my eyes which throb (visually) in sync with my pulse. My vision is distorted slightly in the areas surrounding these vessels while they are throbbing (not severely; the area simply warps slightly). The effect is more noticable when I'm in brightly lit areas; and is also often acccompanied by a sensation of pressure and discomfort (which by some definitions could verge on pain occasionally) as well. This symptom is exacerbated when I bend over or exercise. I have been diagnosed with essential hypertension and am currently taking 20mg of Lisinopril daily as treatment. I have seen several specialists including a nephrologist; a cardiologist; an opthamologist; and a neurologist. The doctor who referred me to them was a pediatrician; and was initially concerned that I may have had an aneurysm. I was sent for an MRI; which was returned as normal. Further testing; including a renal scan; echocardiogram; several eye exams; and a chest x-ray showed no significant problem; gibing me given some insight into the nature of my problem: the nephrologist suggested that my hypertension could have been triggered by adolescence; adding that it may or may not gradually disappear with time. These tests did not; however; explain my visual symptoms; which I find quite distressing. I'm concerned that either my condition hasn't been properly diagnosed; or that my blood pressure is not being consistently controlled. Does this diagnosis sound right to you? Many thanks in advance; -Origin PS: There is one other fact I feel may be relevant: The opthamologist mentioned that I had an "anomalous optic nerve.",2011,2012,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a male in my 40's with elevated cholesterol; high triglycerides; slight hypertension and pre-diabetic. I do take crestor; tricor; and metformin to control those and they are now normal. I take Lisonopril for BP. A few days ago; I woke up from sleep with my heart racing; slight angina and feeling a bit dizzy. Went to the ER where they did a EKG; and echo and chest x-ray. None of them indicated any blockage. However; my HR didn't go down even when I was lying down and on IV fluids. It stayed steady art 110-120 and my BP was high. They did a test to measure my BP while I was lying down (135/100) and when I was standing up (168/117) .. so my BP went up on standing. They sent me home with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and that slightly lowered my heart rate to the 90s and my BP is around 130/90. The doctors couldn't figure out the cause for the episode. I am resting at home at the moment; but I am concerned about taking the beta-blockers. Will this mask a larger issue? I read that higher HR rate typically is accompanied with lower BP; but with me it is the opposite. Also; right after I take the BB; I feel a bit numb and woozy ... it does go away after a while. And a few hours after I take the BB; the HR gets back to the 100s... Any advice on what could be the underlying cause? How concerned should I be?,2015,2015,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been having some pretty moderate breathing issues for about a 2-3 weeks now. I feel like I can't take a deep breath in. There's no pain; but I feel "hungry" for oxygen if that makes sense. I feel like I need to CONSTANTLY yawn really hard to get in a deep; full breath but sometimes that doesn't even work and I just end up light-headed and I feel dizzy from lack of air. I actually hurt my throat one day from yawning too hard! I can't get in a satisfying breath. I've been burping A LOT from trying to constantly breath in so much air. Some details I'd like to add is I'm female; age 27; 125 lbs. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about 2 years ago and I was on Lisinopril for quite awhile but recently lost health insurance this past year so I haven't been able to get back to my regular doctor. I recently stopped smoking cigarettes after smoking for 10 years (I had gotten down to smoking maybe only 3-4 a day before finally quitting last 2 weeks ago and I've switched over to an electronic cigarette with 5% nicotine) Though the breathing issues actually started right before I quit smoking cigarettes. I also stopped eating red meat and drinking alcohol. My blood pressure has gone down some but it's still not in the "normal" range. I've also noticed the problem is worse while sitting or laying down; and I don't notice it as much when I'm standing up or walking around. I don't think this is technically a medical emergency because even though I am experiencing dizziness and disorientation; I am not in any pain and my oxygen levels have measured normal. I'm so discouraged because it's like AS SOON as I decide to make some changes and become healthier; I suddenly can't freaking breath and I'm having horrible anxiety over all of this now.,2018,2018,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi - I am new to this forum. Starting a few mos ago; I had sudden onset malignant hypertension (250/150!) - always had low BP before this. Coincidently; also developed a 7cm ovarian cyst on left ovary. I have had US (both kinds); CT; and MRI and some descriptions were simple cyst; hemmoragic cyst; complex cyst; endometrioma (depending on who was reading it). Every Dr I've spoken to has acted like it was a something we could wait and watch while they searched for a cause of my sudden-onset hypertension. However; I also stopped having periods since Sept (the hypertension started in mid-summer) and my FSH and LH are very high; so the Drs say I am in menopause. I just turned 44; which I realize isn't young; but sudden menopause? and why is it a functional cyst if I'm in menopause? Also; my estrogen and testosterone are in the range of someone in normal reproductive years. I keep thinking all these things are related; but the Drs act like they are all unrelated coincidences (one guy actually said I simply had incredibly bad luck - rofl). Has anyone else developed hypertension w/ an ovarian cyst or ovarian cancer? My CA125 was 15 and I have a history of endometriosis on the same ovary (endometrioma removed 12 yrs ago). I also have the creepy bloating that many people on here have mentioned and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Has anyone else else had this sort of combination of things happen suddenly? Especially the hypertension? Thanks in advance for any insights any of you may have. This is the best site,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,This is my first time using this website. I hate to bother all of you; but I have gone 13 months with symptoms now and the only sure diagnosis I have been given is stubborn hypertension. I understand this website is not intended to make any diagnosis; but I would appreciate if anyone could point me in a direction in which to seek help. I am a 22 year old Male. 6'0; 210 lbs. Starting in 10/2014 I started to experience severe sweating (warm); splitting headaches; cob-web vision and tension behind my eyes. Along with this came dizziness; a heavier heart beat; occasional shakiness; and general fatigue. At the time of these symptoms I was not necessarily healthy. I was around 240lbs.; I was taking pre-workout supplements (creatine; nitric oxide); drinking too much alcohol; and chewing tobacco. I went in to get checked out and had severe hypertension in 180s/100s. I was put on meds (20mg lisinopril) and then saw a cardiologist who performed an ECG & Stress Test. He said that all was fine and to take my meds and start living "healthier". In the following months I cut-out all workout supplements and quit chewing tobacco which I never used heavily to begin with. I also cut down on drinking and lost about 15 pounds; but my symptoms only seemed to worsen. Within the next few months I had a Kidney & Liver ultrasound; CBCs; 24-Hour Urine Catecholamine Tests; Brainwave Tests; you name it. I saw several radiologists and a neurologist who put me on 25mg of Topamax to control my headaches. Nothing abnormal in the testing; but still symptoms. That leads up to this summer. I had to move to a new city; so I decided to give it another shot. I have had another ECG & Stress done as well as basic blood work; a CT Scan; and an ANA anti-bodies test. Still nothing. My doctor has diagnosed my symptoms as "generalized anxiety" and put me on .5 mg of xanax a day as needed. As of now; being on Lisinopril; Topamax; & Xanax my headaches are somewhat controlled. My blood pressure is in the mid-130s/mid-80s; & the xanax seems to chill me out sometimes; but I have begun to build a tolerance. The core symptoms still exist though. I still sweat noticeably easier. I have cob-web vision and tension behind my eyes. I am dizzy and a little shaky as I type this and my body feels like it needs a nap; despite being awake just 4 hours and having had a cup of coffee. As of now I take no supplements. I do not chew tobacco and the only bad habit I have is the occasional binge drinking with my friends once every few months. Having seen a cardiologist; neurologist; radiologists; and multiple general practitioners it is frustrating to have no clear diagnosis and to have only slightly lessened my symptoms. My current doctor has done her due diligence and I do not believe she has done anything wrong or has "failed" necessarily. I would appreciate any advice as far as specialists to see or tests to suggest that may help me reach a diagnosis and ultimately a comfortable living condition. Thank you.,2015,2015,21,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 36 year old female; 8 months post-op MVR; malignant hypertension; with the following concerns: obviously; the malignant hypertension; for which I have been seeing a hypertension specialist at the University of Michigan for since 2007; and the persistence of the following symptoms: extreme fatigue; shortness of breath with minimal exertion; peripheral edema; pulmonary congestion; cough; and palpatations since surgery. I’ve had two echocardiograms and one transespophagal echocardiogram since MVR all indicating moderate to moderately-severe tricuspid regurgitation; mild aortic regurgitation; stage 2 diastolic dysfunction; mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension (42 to 69 mmHg) and 42% ejection fracture. I’m on the following medications: Lasix; Lisinopril; Spirolactone; metopropol; libatolol; norvasc; potassium; and . BP averages between 165/100 - 245/155. Again; I’ve been seeing a Hypertension Specialist since 2007 and all tests have been ran and repeated numerous times. No cause can be identified. My concern is obviously the malignant hypertension and what it is doing to my heart and other organs but also the progression of TR since MVR. Prior to MVR; TR was trace. I’ve read much on the subject of TR following left-sided heart surgery and am aware that often it progresses instead of correcting itself following the correction of the left sided lesion. I also know that TR following MVR/AVR has a poor prognosis. My question is; should I be concerned with it’s progession at this point? If not; when should I? Also; will my hypertension exassperate all these issues? I sincerely thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I also should add that I sought two opinions for the mitral valve regurgitation; one from your institution; that told me that there was nothing anatomically wrong with my MV and that it was functional in nature. Less than two months later; I had my mitral valve repaired at the University of Michigan and it was almost not repairable.,2008,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I am a 53 year old female without a history of hypertension. In the past 6 weeks; I have had three episodes where I ended up in the emergency room. My initial symptoms came on suddenly . They were light headedness; dizziness and then I would start to get really shaky and almost faint. My blood pressure reading at the emergency room were very high 220/110. I had a full cardiac workup but everything was negative ( ECG normal; no elevated cardiac enzymes; blood glucose normal; pulse ox normal) etc) After the third episode my family doctor put me on lisinopril (20 mg) but I continued to have elevated BP's and some of the same symptoms intermittently but not to the magnitude I had without the meds. The doctor increased the ACE inhibitor to 40 mg and is having me do a 24 hour urine collection to see if I have epinephrine/norepinephrine in my urine to identify whether I may have a tumor on my adrenal gland. Is there anything else i should be evaluated for. is an ACE inhibitor the right med? My resting heart rate is about 65 bpm. Any recommendations or suggestions would be helpful. Thank you; annette,2009,2009,53,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am seventeen years of age; have ideopathic hypertension that is controlled for the most part by Lisinopril; weigh 200 pounds; and am experiencing severe chest pain with exercise. This pain occurs for the most part after moderate or heavy exercise once my heart rate begins to drop back to its resting rate. I can run about 1 lap around the track at my school; its the normal high school track and field running track; before I'm panting for breath and feeling like I'm going to fall over dead if I don't stop. It takes about half a lap to get me all out of breath. The same goes for high intensity sports like Lacrosse; Soccer; or American Football. The pains are best classified as a very severe ache in the middle of my chest. I was placed on a bronchodialator for supposed "asthma" and noticed no affect one way or the other. I was then placed on Albuterol and noticed no positive improvement when I tried it before running. It did however cause the pains to occur sooner after exercise and much more severely. I then tried the medication again later that day to try to cure the remains of the pain; and had the pains come back even more severely. I did not seek emergency medical treatment at the time and therefore have no idea what the cause of these pains was. The pains were seemingly timed to my heart beat in that they became more intense when my heart beat. I have experienced these pains for almost two years now. I received an extensive cardio workup in spring of 2010; multiple ekgs (none at the time of the pains); an echo-cardiogram; a stress exercise test (which did not cause the pains to occur; but did leave me very dizzy); and pulmonary function tests (which came up normal); and was told that the only problem was an inconsequential thickening of my aortic valve. The pains have been becoming more and more severe as time progressed since then. They are now far more severe than they were then. I have experienced these pains at rest and as a result of stress as well as a result of exercise. The pains occur when I exercise indoors and when I exercise outdoors. The pains are not accompanied by fever; cough; or abnormal muscle strain. The pains do not occur as a direct result of upper body movement. The pains cannot be recreated by pressing on my chest. The pains do not become more severe when I breathe deeply. The pains do not occur as a result of my breathing deeply. Other symptoms that I have experienced include dizziness after exercise; pounding heart beat at rest and after minor activity (standing or walking a short distance); irregular pulse paired with a tight feeling in my chest; and rapid heartbeat (in the range of 180 bpm) after lifting weights. I exercise regularly at the gym and lift weights. The pains were occurring long before I started lifting weights and were as severe as they are now before I started lifting weights. I have low LDL; high HDL; and high cholesterol. I am not diabetic and I do not have thyroid issues. I do not take medication to control my cholesterol. I do not drink enough water most of the time; but have had the pains occur when I was well hydrated. I was born with a seemingly rare and hard to document non-degenerative congenital myopathy. I have Asperger's Syndrome that could be classified as high functioning Autism. I have not tried taking an antacid tablet when the pains occur. Eating neither causes or cures the pains. Drinking milk neither causes nor cures the pains. I also have frequent and severe headaches. I do not know if these are caused by migraines. I have tried using ibuprofen and aspirin to cure the pains. Ibuprofen did nothing; but aspirin seemed to help. I have never sought emergency medical care as a result of these pains. I am considering seeking emergency medical care the next time they occur. I have not yet seen a pediatric cardiologist again; but I plan to. I am very sorry for the length of this post; I just want an answer to my problem.Thank you.,2010,2011,16,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 47 year old hypertensive male. Quick hypertension history: 25-35 years old: normal/high blood pressure; 135/85 36 years old: 140/90; official hypertensive diagnosis 36-43 years old: many meds tried; no medicine significantly brought down blood pressure; but gave bad side effects. 44 years old: lost weight; from 230 to 205 pounds; blood pressure dropped to 135/85; stopped taking meds I now weigh 195 pounds and until recently my blood pressure has been in the 130/80 range and I've felt great. I don't smoke; sleep well; eat well; take long walks with my dogs; lift weights; life is great. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and a shot of whiskey and a beer at night; my only vices. I gave blood at the red cross two months ago; I give every two months. Blood pressure was normal at that time. Then I go to give blood early last week and it was 160/106. Whoa. Talked to my primary care doc; and the readings were confirmed; but she didn't prescribe anything as I have a shaky history with any med working. She just had me monitor at home. Since then I'm getting readings typically about 177/112; with some readings into the 190/120 range; but some lower around 160/105. A nurse friend made me go to the ER over the weekend she was so worried when it stayed over 185/115; but since I wasn't having organ failure; they just gave me a single 0.1 mg clonidine and sent me away. I saw my urologist on Monday for a followup to the kidney stone event I had last year. I had a small stone pass back then and on x-ray they saw a 4 mm stone sitting in my right kidney; so I had a scheduled follow up to check on it. The stone has moved to my ureter and has gotten stuck; about halfway. I've been feeling significant pain on that side since the end of December; but I had a kidney infection which was treated with ampicillin at that time and thought it was all related to that. Oh; my blood pressure at the end of December was slightly elevated (148/92); probably due to the PSGN (it was strep bacteria in my kidney; which causes elevation). Now I have a partially; maybe intermittently fully blocked ureter. My right kidney showed mild enlargement; but kidney functions are normal. The urologist prescribed Cardura to help open up the ureter to pass the stone; and it also lowers the blood pressure about 30/20 points for a few hours. Been on it a couple of days now. If in 3 weeks it hasn't passed; they'll remove it surgically. I'm also getting nausea; palpitations; nervousness; sweats; cold intolerance; racing pulse; irritation; etc.; and have been since early January. . So..... my question is; can a blocked ureter cause a very high spike in hypertension like I'm seeing? I mean; I've basically gone from normal-high to acute severe hypertension in about 2-3 weeks. Nothing about this seems right and I'm very concerned.,2016,2016,47,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello all; thank you for reading. My son; 17 years old; has had consistently high blood pressure (160/90-100) for around 4 years. While this may be common for overweight teens; or teens that don't exercise; he is in AMAZING "lance armstrong" shape. He runs and works out daily; eats very healthy; and is very muscular; fit and seemingly the vision of health. However; he has been on blood pressure medication for 4 years (lisinopril) and doctors cannot find the cause of his hypertension. The only thing that has been discovered is an enlarged heart and thickened walls. My question is; could there possibly be a defect that no one has found? What could be the cause of this? What tests should he have? He has already had an MRI and an ultrasound... He has started having chest pains more frequently; and I cannot tell you the pain I feel for him... Please help me; I'm afraid for his life.. Thank you; Sara,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was sent to a doctor by my union for a yearly physical On May 15; 2009. The doctor found my pressure to be 160/100. Asked if I had any previous problems. I advised him I had a physical in Dec 2008; pressure was 150/90; blood work; EKG; all fine. He decided to do and echocardiogram. He advised I should return the following week. I did so on May 23; and was advised pressure was still high 160/100 and he stated my Echo was fine. He prescribed Lisinopril 10mg; 1x day. Two weeks later; I received a call from his office (June 14) stating the Echo showed a hole in my heart; and he wanted to see me in his office on Friday; June 19. When I arrived; he stated that the Echo was blurred; and the reading was not correct. And since he did not think my insurance company would pay for another Echo so soon after the last....he wants me to go for a heart MRI. I have no other health problem; no headaches; dizziness; no shortness of breath; no palpitations; no chest pains. I am just so confused. Is an MRI necessary,2009,2009,65,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am 26 and have taken lisinopril (10mg) and metoprolol (25mg 2x per day) for several years to control high blood pressure. I occasionally smoke tobacco from a hookah. For the last two years or so I have noticed that after I do so my entire rib cage feels very tight; swollen and achy. Then for a few days when I breath deeply or move around I sometimes get pains between ribs (it does not feel like lungs... more like between lungs and ribs or between ribs). This never used to happen and is very uncomfortable. I don't have any issues breathing... no coughing; no mucus; no wheezing... I don't have any trouble doing vigorous exercise. I just get this very irritated/inflammed/tight feeling in my rib cage. Does anyone know if either of my meds can cause/contribute to this? What bothers me is that this never used to happen even when I smoked much more frequently; and the discomfort seems not to have anything to do with my lungs/breathing. Any thoughts or advice???,2011,2011,25,Male

My question is; could there possibly be a defect that no one has found? What could be the cause of this? What tests should he have? He has already had an MRI and an ultrasound... He has started having chest pains more frequently; and I cannot tell you the pain I feel for him... Please help me.. Thank you; Sara,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter. The Heart Center website contains a directory of the cardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem.,1999,1999,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,I had been on a low dose of Lisinopril for a few years for mild hypertension. Before the holidays I notices my bp was elevated so went to my doctor. He increased my Lisinopril and added Tenormin. I began to have the normal side effects; fatigue; heart pounding; etc. Since then we have tried Norvasc; and metoprolol all with side effects. After discontinuing the metoprolol; I noticed my hands; feet and sometimes knees were becoming discolored when I sat or after showering. When standing or lying they returned to normal color. My doc said this is from the blood pooling and was probably related to taking the beta blockers. I am still on Lisinopril and now Cardizem but as still having problems with the red hands & feet. It is very embarrassing. Has anybody had this problem and does it eventually go away. I have always been intolerant to cold but never had extreme color changes until starting the medications.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 29 yr; overweight and was diagnosed with MVP from an ECHO in Feb. The cardiologist referred me for further eval bc it also showed an est. EF of 45%. I took a MUGA scan in Sept which confirmed this. EF was 47.8%; I had also started Lisinopril from my visit 1-2 wks prior. I was then sent for stress thalium to rule out CAD in which it came back negative and an increased EF of 62%. I also have had symptoms of extreme fatigue very often; chest discomfort; inc HR; and swelling legs. The cardiologist believes my symptoms are most likely due to MVP and not a major heart condition. I would like to believe that and it does make sense from the literature but the reason as to why my EF was low in the first place is still unanswered. He also mentioned a virus could have caused the EF situation but I doubt a virus from Feb-Sept. He increased my Lisinopril to 20mg. What other conditions could cause my EF problems? The cardiologist says that EF fluctuates all the time but it is just odd to me that from Feb - Sept it is approx in the same range and only improved once I got Lisinopril. I never have been diagnosed with HTN but my BP did fluctuate alot meaning sometimes in the pre-HTN stage. Please advise as I am very frustrated that this is taking so long to find out what to do. I would love that it be simple as MVP but the EF bothers me. What should I do? They also eluded to f/u for CT diseases as a cause of the EF problems. I was tested some years ago for Lupus and sarcodosis when these symptoms 1st arrived but they both were negative. The swelling in my legs do not occur continuously but usually it occurs when I am not feeling my best and usually present w/ the fatigue.,2007,2007,,Female

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi! My daughter is a swimmer and runs track in high school (weight:115; height: 5'3) she was found to have high blood pressure while she was at the oral surgeon having a tooth extracted 205/135; we thought the machine was broke. the following couple of days her bp was aprox. 170/120. She is now seeing a pediatric nephrologist who has done blood tests; echo; and kidney angiogram all which came back negative. 1 1/2 months later she is on Norcasc 10 mg. and lisinopril 5 mg. which now is back in the normal range most of the time. Last October at her sports physical her bp was 115/67. So in the last 6 mos sometime her bp went crazy. My question is should she see a endocronologist or a Cardiologist even though the echo looked normal? This whole thing just seems so wierd.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Had RAI in 1997; Was on .05mg synthroid until 2006. Taken off meds due to supressed TSH. My last labs showed elevated TSI and TPO antibodies; TSH 1.96 range .34-5.6. T4 .88 range .58-1.64. T3 3.6 range 2.3-4.2. I have been having transient episodes of muscle weakness mostlly in the legs; bouts of diahrea; a rash along my shin bone; get tired eaisly and when working in the yard it is harder to breath. I sometimes get light headed; and very warm when working and sweat alot. At first I had these episodes once or twice a year but have had 15-20 withing the past few month's. I have seen a geriactic dr and an endo who both say that the symptoms are not related to my thyroid because it is normal. Seems like hyper symptoms to me or am I going nuts. Heart; Liver; Spleen; Kidneys all are normal but am on Lisinopril for systolic hypertension and have occasional premature ventricular contractions. Could these symptoms be related to increased in TSI;TPO titer causing a transient surge in thyroid hormones???,2007,2008,65,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 42 year old male and having Hypertension since the age of 32. I have tried several Beta Blockers & ACE Inhibitors in the past 10 years. I used to change the medication every 2~3 years when they were found ineffective. Following is a list of medicines I have consumed in the order : Atenolol; Lisinopril; Enalapril & Bisoprolol. Recently when my BP was at a rate of 170/110; my doctor prescribed following medicines : Metpure XL 25 (Metoprolol 25Mg) & Arbitel-H (Telmisartan 40Mg). Now the BP at a controlled level. As I can understand it; first one is a Beta Blocker & other is an ACE-Inhibitor . But; after starting these medicines ; I feel very weak & exhausted . Though I have been taking different medicines in the past; I never felt so lethargic. I can't run a 100 Mtrs or climb a hill. Could it be the side-effect of the medicines or am I taking an over-dose ?,2009,2009,42,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,60 year old male. 130lbs overwieght (currently dieting) Beeen taking Lisinopril 20ml twice day for two years. Atenanol 50ml once day and 80 ml asperin. Has previously controlled my hypertension/high blood pressure. The last week or so all my BP readings have been over 170/110. High was 198/118 yesterday morning. Went to emergency.They did an EKG; chest x-ray and heart enzyme blood test (twice) All looked pretty good except the enzyme test which I was told was ;"Slightly elavated". Dr. said normal was .33 and my bloood enzyme tested at .35. Not sure how to interprut that reading. He was first going to keep me until he heard I had had a chemical stress test 18 months ago that was clean at which point he told me I could go home but to double my intake of Lisinpril to 40 ml twice a day. My blood pressure does not seem to be coming down much though I just started with the increased dosage admittedly. I am stressing over results of enzyme test.Don't know how to understand the results. Can you shed some light? Thanks; SmilelinK,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I received my echocardiogram back yesterday and on the findings I was diagnosed with stage I diastolic LV dysfunction; mild mitral regurgitation and mild right ventricular enlargement. I have hypertension that was diagnosed 2 years ago and I am on Lisinopril and it is controlled. My father had heart disease at 59 and had a CABG x3 with a vavlve replacement so this makes me a bit concern. I am only 40 years old. Should I be concerned?

Lisinopril+hypertension,I've been wrestling with a severe vertigo problem for the last 4 days. Went to see my PCP this AM who discovered my blood pressure is running high...130/100. I've NEVER had an issue with BP before. Usually; I'm the poster child for normal BP (120/60). In addition of putting me on Lisinopril 10 mg.; I had an EKG and am being sent to the "balance clinic" as I failed the "sobriety test" heel/toe walk and had a positive Romberg. I'm wondering about POTS - with hypertension instead of hypotension????? Any thoughts??? (Keep in mind I'm 8 months post op decompression and fusion skull to c2).,2011,2013,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 25 years old and currently take Lisinopril for HTN. I have aortic valve disease. I am being seen by a cardiologist. I am having intermittent chest pain with frequent PVC's. PVC's sometimes cause very short dyspnea episodes. All of these symptoms cause anxiety and all I think about is something bad happening. I work on an ambulance and have seen way too many people ignore their symptoms and sometimes result in death. Should I be worried about the cardiac symptoms? Or should I be treated for anxiety?

Lisinopril+hypertension,I recently visited a Cardiologist due to experiencing left sided chest aches. This is not the first time I have visited a Cardiologist as I underwent a Nuclear Stress Test in 2010 (Which came back normal) Continuing to experience the aforementioned chest discomfort I visited another Cardiologist as the former had relocated his practice to another state. Anyway; this time (two weeks ago) I was given yet another Nuclear Stress Test and an Echo. Went back to the doc and received what I perceived as good news / not so good news. Normal Nuclear Stress Test; and “Moderate” thickening of the heart muscle. That is all I remember unfortunately but if I understand correctly this is called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy correct? Anyway; I am a 41 year old white male; no diabetes; no kidney issues; and take Lisinopril and Cardizem. Doc says he wants to see me a couple of times a year for BP / weight check (I’m kind of a big guy) Question is: Do I need to freak out about this? Or is this something that comes with age etc.,2011,2013,,

I've been walking everyday for 30-45 minutes but recently I've been feeling so tired. I'm tolerating all my medications and my BP has been within normal range.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello I am a 46 y/o female; NS; ND; who is now at a healthy weight. About 2 years ago-I had several episodes of what seemed to be classic angina. I had a stress test and echo done; and no cause was found. I was diagnosed with MILD hypertension; and treated with Lisinopril at that time. I was about 25# overweight then; and was advised to lose weight and begin an exercise program. The plan was to investigate the chest pain further if it recurred. I had no furthur problems until last week. I (with my docs ok) came off the Lisinopril slowly last month; to see if my weight loss and exercise program would allow me to get by without it. I had a 5 hour episode of chest pain at work last week; characterized by an intense pressure/pain in my chest; radiating to my throat and lower jaw. This pain eased when I rested for a bit; only to resume when I would get back up and resume work. Maalox did'nt help. Saw my doc the next day; who did an EKG (just some LAH noted on that) has scheduled a stress test; and put me back on the Lisinopril (BP running about 140/mid 90's at this point again). and gave me some nitro to carry. Once I began the Lisinopril again; no furthur problems. What would be your recommendations regarding furthur investigation; assuming the stress test will once again be negative? Could the Lisinopril be helping in some way? I don't obsess about my heart; in fact I rarely think about it at all. Just seems funny I don't have these pains while I am on it. Do you think a cath is indicated? Lipid profile pending; OK 2 years ago. Thanks.,2001,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Good morning Dr. I go to see my Gastro doctor ever three months. 523 days ago I was diagnosed with end stage alcoholic cirrhosis. Here are a list of my symptoms: End stage cirrhosis Gall stones Splenomegaly Portal hypertension Varices grade 3 Spider nevi Hepatic encephalopathy Hiatal hernia Umbilical hernia During my last visit to the doctor he told me that “he guarantees that in about 5 years I will be needing a liver transplant; 10 years on the outside.” I imagine he is basing this on the severity of my portal hypertension. My platelet 67; ammonia 61; bilirubin 2.4; GGT 127. 6 months ago meld score 8. At the time of diagnosis 17. So I feel recovery has been going amazingly well for me. The rest of my numbers are all within normal ranges. l limits and I drink probably 10-12 16oz bottles of water a day. Medications: I take vitamin C; B-complex; milk thistle. Other daily meds include xifaxan; lactalose; lexapro and metoprolol. Blood pressure diuretic Lisinopril;Hydrochlorthiazide 20mg/12.5mg. BP is 100/58. Diagnosed at age 38 currently 39 male. 1) Finally on to my question; is it really strange that I don’t have or never have had Ascites or Edema? Is this a problem you see in my future? 2) I’ve tried to provide as much information as possible so I could ask you if you agree with my doctors assessment of transplantation. 3) I currently have great medical insurance through my wife’s work. If we relocate and she loses the insurance I would be eligible for Medicare. Would having different insurance effect the procedure or my ability to have the procedure in any way? Should I consider not relocating? 4) Is there a large risk of a liver not being available at the time of my needing one? 5) Do you have any suggestions for me? I would really apreciate the advice.,2010,2011,39,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I haver been on hypertension med for 48 yrs. I am 76 now retired and not leading a stressful life. I am on 5mg lisinopril for hypertension once daily. Problem: bp avg upon arising in am averages 190/100. After stirring around bp is normal and below for the rest of the day. The last two nights; I have been very careful to sleep on my side and it has helped. ex: 142/83. I am going to try wearing my partials tonight and see if that helps. (holding my jaws further apart).

Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension/high BP in June when the nurse at work sent me to ER with a BP of 210/120. I was immediately put on Norvasc 10mg and HCTZ 25mg daily. My pressure came down to 160/80 and after seeing my doc he said come back in 6 months. After questioning why I had high blood pressure and not getting any answers I asked to see another doc and he added Lisinopril 10mg and said come back in 6 months. Since then BP has been steady at 130's/40's. After bugging the doc enough about why at 32 i have to take 3 meds to keep BP under control he has finally set me up to see a kidney specialist. I have been experiencing soreness and weakness in my elbows; like tendonitis; extreme fatigue and burning in my arms when doing light work; tiredness and overall fatigue; since beginning these meds. I have to tell you that I also had a diskectomy in my lower backbecause of a herniated disk shortly after being put on these meds; but have fully recovered and take no pain killers. I would like to know if these are side effects of the meds or if it is possible i have some disease that affects my joints/disks as well as raises my BP?,2009,2009,31,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi there. First timer with a question about Losaran for hypertension. My BP runs about 140/90 without medication. I am not overweight (BMI of 22; age 57). My GP put me on Lisinopril last year but switched me to Losartan after the Lisinopril failed to help. The Losartan brought my BP down a lot with a 50 mg daily dose. I was down to 110/70 and even 100/65 at times. I even got light-headed when I stood up quickly. The GP said this was normal and good. He likes my BP to be well below 120/80. So far so good. I was getting the Losartan from Walgreens as a 30 day supply. My insurance wanted me to go to a 90 day 'Express Scripts' route since this was a long-term maintenance drug and so I did. Gradually; I notice my BP creeping up and up until now it is back to the 135/85 range. I am using an Omron 785 cuff meter which I have proven to myself is fairly accurate. I even took it to my GP's office and compared it to his reading with a sphygmo. Right on the mark. I notice that the Express Script drug I now use is made by Apotex whereas the original Walgreen brand was Cozaar. I went back to Walgreens and asked the pharmacist if there was any chance that the Apotex was inferior/impotent to the Cozaar for some reason. She assured me that could not be the case and that there could be no difference. Losartan is Losartan is Losartan. As an experiment(with GP consensus); I doubled my dose of Apotex Losartan from 50 to 100 mg a day for one week. No change in BP. I am baffled. GP does not have a clue either. I want to try going back to Cozaar. Sound reasonable?,2014,2014,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 51 year old female with a long standing history of high blood pressure. Up until a couple of years ago; it was well controlled with enalapril and HCTZ. About 2 years ago; when it started going up; Toprol XL 50 mg was added. Still not well controlled; the enalapril was dropped and 20 mg of Lisinopril added. I seemed to tolerate this well without any noticeable side effects. Just recently; BP noted to still be on the high side so a second dose of Lisinopril 20 mg added for a total of 40 mg daily. Since adding the 2nd dose of Lisinopril; my heart rate and BP have dropped significantly. My heart rate has been as low as 48 and more typically is in the 50's or low 60's. My blood pressure is in the range of 100/68 - 110/85. I do not like the way I feel since adding this 2nd dose of Lisinopril. I am very fatigued and almost have a "drugged" feeling throughout the day. Questions: 1. Can this medication make me feel like this? 2. Should I be concerned about the low heart rate? 3. Are there other blood pressure meds that can control my blood pressure without these side effects?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi All; I'm a 26 year old male with a heart rate question. My sitting heart rate during the day usually ranges from 60 to 80; however when I am standing my heart rate ranges from 80 to 100. When I am walking for exercise; between 3.3 to 4 mph my BPM is between 100 to 120; sometimes 125;130 if its really hot outside. I'm 6ft 240 lbs. I was at 280 lbs just 4 months ago so I've lost a lot of weight through exercise and diet. However I'm not really seeing any improvement in my heart rate. I was an athlete growing up; always active; lifting; running; sports etc; then three years ago I got a desk job and put on 50 lbs over the course of a year. I don't understand why my heart rate increases so much simply by standing. When I'm laying down after waking or before going to sleep my heart rate is sometimes as low as 50. I should also mention I have pre-hypertension; so my blood pressure is slightly high but below 140/90; however my doctor doesn't have me on any meds. I have GERD as well. Additional Information: In February of 2014 I was on Lisinopril for high blood pressure; but after two weeks I had sudden heart attack like symptoms that landed me in the ER. I had several tests done including chest x-ray; chest CAT scan; blood work; EKG; Ultra sound of my heart before and after a stress test. All the tests concluded my heart was fine so they don't know what caused it. However my primary doctor took me off Lisinopril because she believed it was an allergic reaction. However she did put my on a 4 week heart rythm study where I wore a mobile EKG device. They didn't discover anything concerning other than some occasional early heart beats. My doctor said we have all the evidence to say my heart is healthy so I feel confident my heart is okay.,2014,2014,26,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,When I recently went in for a chest infection my blood pressure was way out there. The doctor put me on two 10mg capsules of Lisinopril a day. My blood pressure remains high.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 54yo white man; mild high BP (140/90) and cholesterol (220) but otherwise no medical problems. Two weeks ago I noticed my right arm was feeling "floppy" -- loose and weak. Had it checked out by my PCP a couple of days later; nothing clinically significant found. This has progressed to both arms and sometimes legs though the right side is always more than the left; and the arms more than the legs. My limbs are not actually weak; e.g. I can still pick up my 80# daughter w/ no extra effort; and did gardening all weekend no trouble. Grip strength is normal; but I feel uncoordinated and stiff in the fingers and a little clumsy; I've had pens fly out of my hand twice for no reason; and tripped when there wasn't anything unusual to trip over. I have occasional fasciculations (right arm; left calf and shoulder) and tremors in my right hand and occ the left. Tremors are not new but seem a bit worse; there is a family history of essential tremor. I have also noticed some minor speech difficulties; particularly with "sh" sounds followed by things like "ts" or "st" -- for example in conversation I pronounced "crushed stone" as "crush shtone" and had to try 3 times to get it right. All this started w/in a week after BP meds were increased from 10 mg to 40 mg lisinopril/day; but I know neuro effects are rare w/ lisinopril. I am an anxious type re health and my big worry of course is ALS. I also wonder about brain tumor; stroke; etc. I know you can't diagnose online but just would like to know what impression all this gives and what the possibilities are. Thanks!,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello all My doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 40mg when my blood pressure was 170/105 at hospital about 6 months ago. I had dizziness (electricity going through my brain feeling) and fatigue; hard time breathing before the doctor's visit; but even after the medication; the symptoms continued. But; my blood pressure was regulated to around 110/80. Then; slowly; my blood pressure started coming down even more to 100/80; 90/70; then 80/60. So Doctor told me to take only 20mg of lisinopril every day. I did. Then; even more serious headaches; dizziness; and feeling like fainting; and high blood pressure. So Doctor then prescribed Atenolol 25mg per day. One week of trial. Even higher blood pressure around 170/110. So Doctor then advised that I should take both Lisinopril 30mg in the morning; and Atenolol 25mg at night. This has been working quite well for few weeks; bringing my blood pressure to 100/60 almost every time I measured it. But; recently; I started having those peak moments where I would start freezing/trembling; severe headaches/dizziness; and my legs had no strength that I fell few times. My arms/hands felt like there was no circulation; that I coudnt even hold a drug bottle. Blood pressure around 165/110. Then; I took Xanax. This helped almost every time I had this happened to me. But; these days; those happenings where I would have crazy dizziness and weakness in all my body and my blood pressure going up skyhigh come to me more often. Everytime I take Xanax; it does help; but only temporarily. Doctor tells me that I am having panic/anxiety attacks; and the medications actually do work; because all that matters is the average blood pressure; not just few incidents per week. I feel like there must be some other hypertension medication out there that should get rid of these symptoms and get my blood pressure stable. Because when it's stable; I feel OK. These days; not. I have high blood pressure very often even with the medications... not the anxiety attacks... I don't know what to do. Doc tells me to stop worrying and keep my current meds; but I want to change them.,2010,2010,49,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'll try to keep this brief; but want to include some medical and overall life details. I'm 41; been divorced for just over five years; and met a lady a little over two months ago; and we've fallen in love quickly. I'm not used to falling fast; but I don't regret it. We decided we wanted to be intimate last night; but it didn't work too well. It's been about a year and a half since my last sexual experience. I've also struggled with porn; and am making a big effort to stay away from it; though it's not easy. I want my source of arousal to come from my partner. But there could be a medical root to this as well. I've had issues with high triglycerides and was taking niacin with nicotinic acid and flaxseed oil for a long time. Back in February 2015; I had a heart scare that turned out to be left ventricular hypertrophy brought on by hypertension. My blood pressure was around 145/80; and no telling how long that had been going on. Doc put me on 12.5mg of lisinopril with a diuretic and a statin drug. This helped; but I was totally unable to get an erection. I wasn't sexual with anyone; but that didn't seem normal. Doc prescribed 20mg of Levitra and changed me to 20mg of lisinopril without the diuretic. I used the Levitra to make sure blood still flowed to my penis; but even without it; things seemed to be more normal. After about 2 months and some lifestyle changes that included exercise and cutting sugar; doc took me off the statin drug. When I was married; my ex was really bad about withholding intimacy; and did that off and on for several years. I've been with a few women since my divorce and have been satisfied; but have deliberately kept that number small. Last night; we'd had a fun but busy day. We decided to lie down; and one thing led to another... I took a Levitra and we had foreplay while the drug took effect. I achieved an erection; but couldn't sustain it. I was laying on my back and she gave me oral; and it still seemed to shrink. We got it back up and she climbed on top; and it would last for awhile; but it would shrink. I was never able to climax. Needless to say; it's frustrating. I just wonder if this is a medical problem; or a psychological one. I really want things to work properly. Thank you;,2015,2015,40,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 72 year old female being seen at Stanford by a "heart failure" physician. Emergency visit with ATF and shortness of breath in Jan. Chest X-ray & EKG found enlarged heart; hypertension; ATF; injections to reduce hypertension and stabilize ATF; given diltiazem. Overall health is good; take nutricianal supplements consistantly. Take no medications; LDL too high; HDL 85 and triglycerides within range; risk ratio is about 3.5+/-. Stanford doc started me on carvedilol 12.5 2 x/day; lisinopril 5 mg 1/day and coumadin 5 mg 1 x/day; unable to tolerate lisinopril; switched to divan 160 1 x/day. Carvedilol increased to 25 mg 2 x/day. Ejection factor 30. I feel worse now than I did when I left the emergency and was placed on diltizem; heart rate is even higher (today 175/129 - pulse 50) similar in my local physician's office 2 days ago. I have worse symptoms since I started taking drugs. I have heart noises; am breathless; have fatigue; and feel the need for more oxygen. Stanford will do stress tests; etc. cardionversion in 3 mos. Not sure I want to continue taking these drugs (except coumadin) or go through that. If I had arrythmia for 50+ years; what is normal for me and how will jolts with "jewels" get me there. I am opposed to taking anymore medication - especially for cardioversion as they are so toxic. I wouldn't mind a second opinion about the drugs. Thanks; 1Jackie,2008,2008,72,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Healthy 150 lb age 61; shaken when I had 1st recorded AFib Nov ’07 (after dental surgery) causing me to go on 25 mg. Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a night of AFib episode ( I was urinating frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out. After the fainting; cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on blocker); I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16 two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark below 50 & record beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin; they were going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on before I was switched off to Lisinopril). Since going to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress; very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp. I still from time get a weird feeling in my head (like interference) and worry Memory is not as fast at retrieving…..maybe my magination. Very gratefull so far AFib seems to be in check….fingers crossed. My /optimistic ? If someone has a 6 - 12 month run of only 5-10 short mild Afib episodes; is getting off coumidin a possibility.Aside from bleeding I assume drug has side effects???aside from issue of metal in your chest; once implanted successfully does pacem presence effect morbidity for an otherwise healthy person?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I am a 32 year old; male; 6'3"; 269 lbs. I have been using Ocean's nasal irrigation and spray for a few months now. My sinuses are still very dry and irritated. As of now I stopped using it and have now noticed that every time my nose gets runny the mucus taste very salty. Is it possible that there is a salt deposit in my sinus cavity due to all the saline use? Also; I was not aware that you should be bent over while using an irrigation spray in your sinuses; so the whole time I have been using it I have stood upright and then leaned over slightly to drain. Also; since then I have recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure. i have never had an issue my whole life...always a 120/80 kind of guy. I was trying to make sense on whether or not this is possibly related or whether it is even possible to have a salt residue left inside the sinus cavity after using saline.

It gives me a great deal of pleasure to dig dirt; clear land; cut up firewood with a chain saw; etc. Up until 5 months ago I could work fairly hard for 4 or 5 hours and then feel tired; but a good tired (if you know what I mean) - ready to eat; shower and go to Walmart with my wife.I smoked one PPD until 6 months ago when wheezing was interfering with going to sleep at night. I was able to abruptly quit with the help of nicotine lozenges; and my dosage of them today is down to about 20 mg./day. For one month after I quit; there was a dramatic improvement in my breathing and well-being - the wheezing disappeared after a few days.Then; 5 months ago; I started experiencing dizziness; tachycaria (120's); hypotension (lowest 78/43 - barely able to make it back to the house from the yard) and extreme fatigue - all this with any kind of exertion. My hypertension disappeared a few months after smoking cessation except for something like 134/93 every few days whereupon I take 5 mg. of Lisinopril (half a little blue tablet) with good result. This fatigue is getting worse. Just bringing groceries into the house from the car is exhausting; and I'm very SOB. Occasionally I feel a tiny bit of pressure over my sternum; but nothing to run to the doctor with My medical conditions: cervical spinal stenosis; hypertension controlled with lisinopril; left diaphragmatic hemiplegia; peripheral neuropathy; mild sleep apnea and moderate COPD. The CSS occurred about 6 years ago and was diagnosed with an MRI when I complained of very severe neck pain. They ordered daily morphine which I later refused; afraid of addiction. In any case the pain gradually faded. I believe it was around this time that the left diaphragmatic hemiplegia was diagnosed; but I'm not very good with placing and remembering the occurence of past events with accurately.A recent PFT showed an FVC of 4.16 L. with an increase of 20% with a bronchodilator. The interpretation was: " Spirometry reveals a moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. There is a bronchidilator response. My PCP has tried every blood test in the book. He ordered a sleep study; hence the "mild sleep apnea". I now sleep with a machine (or try to). I'm on my 3rd day with that. I would very much appreciate any advice you may have for me. Thank you.,2012,2012,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi! I'm new to this forum and have a question for you. I just had a complete blood workup done and everything was great except my GFR was only 55 and was flagged. I'm curious what could cause this and if I should be worried. This is the first time it has been low. I am on medicine for high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Thank you for your help.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I had an MI about 21 months ago. Left me with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. LVEF is approx. 45% (no change over this time period). From echo report of last November there were changes - Tricuspid valve doppler indicates elevated right heart pressure calculated at 55 millimeters of mercury; most likely due to diastolic dysfunction; but abnormal considering patients age (I was 59) Mean pulmonary artery pressure calculated at 30 millimeters of mercury consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension During the period when my echo was done my systemic BP had been running high (140s/90s) for a couple of months; due to added stress in my personal life; but I do not know if my BP was high during the echo; but I think it was likely. For most of the year before last November’s echo my BP had been fine; averaging about 115/70 with a HR of about 60 (I take BP at home routinely and have checked my monitor against the Doctor's BP readings several times so have confidence in my home readings). I was on 6.25 carvedilol and still am. Taken off lisinopril early 2013 due to cough. I was prescribed 50 mg Losartan which I started in January after my doctors visit in which he noted the elevated pressures and BP. My at home readings have been fine all year; running about 115/70 HR of 60); except for the occasional pressure a little above 130/90; and these have always occurred when I feel stressed. During my last doctors visit of a few weeks ago my BP was 143/92 in his office and my home monitor; which I took into the office; agreed. So it appears that at times I have the white coat response. So my question - If the echo was done when my systemic BP was elevated (say 140s/90s) would this make the right heart pressure readings and pulmonary artery readings higher than they would be if my BP had settled back to its normal levels of < 120/80? thanks,2012,2014,59,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom is 72 and had a 5 way bypass in 1998. She is very active and not overweight. Her meds are Aldactazide every other day; 50 mg Toporal daily; 40 mg lisinopril daily; 20 mg lipitor daily. About 6 months ago; she started having erratic BP with blurry eyes; pain in jaw. BP got as high as 295/135. Went to ER; run blood work and EKGs--nothing shows and they doubled meds; blood pressure comes down sometimes as low as 90/50. Then meds are changed again. Blood pressure spikes. Another trip to the ER. The trips to the ER about every 2 weeks. Over Thanksgiving; she was admitted was high BP-more tests--nothing. Yesterday; she was fine until she took aldactazide at 3:30 and by 8:30 her BP was 232/99; pulse 77. It seems her BP only rises at night. She was seen by her cardiologist yesterday and he scheduled a stress test for January. She's exhausted from spending so much time in the ER and scared. I don't think she should wait until January. Any advice? One Very Concerned Daughter,2004,2004,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I work for a nonprofit company reviewing medical information for MR clients who live in a group home. One of these individuals is taking 5 blood pressure meds: Coreg; Tekturna; Clonidine; Lisinopril; Verapamil. He also takes Lasix. His PCP prescribes him these medications. He also has other health problems; including Diabetes; Gout; Neurogenic bladder; renal failure; anemia; degenerative joint disease. Needless to say; he takes many meds to control these other conditions. I was wondering how many blood pressure medications is common to take? Also; he doesn't have a cardiologist and his PCP is prescribing these meds; which is good that his PCP likes to keep track of all of this; however; I feel that a physician more experienced in cardiology should look at him. His hemotologist also has recently stated he may have myelodysplasia - considering that if thats the case; his blood will be more thin and possibly not require all of these medications. Anyway; I just wanted to get an idea of how many blood pressure pills is common; or rather; how many blood pressure pills is too many to take? Thanks,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was misdiagnosed 5 years ago by a cardiologist that told me that my heart was normal for my size. I am 6'4" 300 lbs. I then went to the hospital 4 months ago on 10/15/07 with heart related issues and had a heart cath done and was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and really have read many articles and do not know what to expect for my health in the future? I am now taking Lisinopril for Hypertension and Lipator and Tricor for slow weak heart beat and Lavaza amega 3 oils for low CDL and low HDL...both were under 60. With a weak heart my doctor says do not get my heart rate to high over 120 and do not excercise but; I am over wieght so what should I do. I have two questions; one how to loose wieght woth out excercise; and two what to expect from cardiomyopathy in the future and weak heart?,2008,2008,34,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I had a nuclear medicine perfusion test and it showd my LVEF to be 46% but my echocardiogram showd it to be 60%. A the test time I was on 240 mg diltiazem and 40 mg Lisinopril daily. I do have a history of bad hypertension. I do suffer from occasional PVC and PAC's. Any opinion? Thanks.,2008,2008,50,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am overweight; do not exercise regularly; take lisinopril for hypertension. I recently went to the E;R; for chest pains. I underwent a barrage of tests of which I obtained copies. I was never told what was wrong or what to do other than follow up with my physician. What levels would be elevated in my lab work and what would they mean,2010,2010,50,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,In a previous question posted June 16; Dr. Brown indicated that diabetes and high blood pressure; even if well controlled; are contributing factors to the development of retinal swelling after cataract surgery. I would like to read more about this. Could you suggest resources or published studies backing this up? I have corresponded on this site for three years post-lens replacement surgery with very persistent chronic CME that is refractory to treatment of every possible kind you can name. One retina specialist is most lately suggesting a membrane peel at this point; hypothesizing that epiretinal membrane traction is the cause. This is his hypothesis since there is no inflammatory source; no vitreous traction because I had vitrectomy; no retinal vein occlusion; no diabetes. Could it be something as simple as blood pressure? I have mild high blood pressure that is well controlled with 10 mg daily lisinopril. I would like to know what studies show about this.Can you help?,2007,2010,51,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had high blood pressure for 10 years now. I have been on just about every medication on the market. I have had a lot of bad reactions to medications especially calcium blockers. I sometimes respond to the initial treatment but eventually; they always seem to lose their effectiveness. Recently after being hospitalized for 5 days (Blood Pressure at time 210/130) I have several doctors with different opinions ; one believes I have Liddle Syndrome and another group believes I have hyperaldosteronism. I have elevated sodium levels;(I follow a low sodium diet) and occassionally have very low potassium levels. I am currently taking the maximum dosage of Toprol; clonidine; spironolactone and lisinopril. This worked fine for several weeks but now my pressure is climbing again; does anyone else have this problem? My test results for various test keep coming back inconclusive or they keep saying different medications may be throwing th results off. One test showed I had hyperaldosteronism; the next showed I didn't. Help?,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,This problem started about a month ago. I am a 39yo male and have been having back problems off and on for 9 months. My left leg has always had pain since; so I decided to go see a Chiropractor to see if he or she could alleviate it. After my 5th session I noticed a tingling sensation in my penis and a pulling/retraction pain. I awoke the next morning with a painful erection and ever since it has been painful. Also when I stand or stretch my penis retracts into my body and when I lie down it relaxes. I had an MRI of my back and they said they found nothing remarkable. The doctor also did a physical exam and found nothing wrong. I am in a lot of pain and frustrated. Any help would be extremely appreciated. Thank You; Chris I,2008,2008,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,2 weeks ago I started to wake up with this annoying buzzing noise coming from inside; sometimes I think they come from my upper chest; Esophagus or Throat;not sure; also I have this noiseless intermittent electrical currents on all my body when I am semi-concious. I have been evaluate by cardiologist 3 month ago because I have this skiped beats every once on a while and he said everything is fine; all my test came out negative; I got MRI on my spine last week and came out negative. Just I am taking my regular BP pills (Lisinopril 20mg) once a day. I am 34 years old; 6 feet tall; and 220 lb; I eat healthy foods. I have recorded my buzzing noise with my portable voice recorder I wish I could upload it but I don't see how. They wake me up every time I feel them; it is so annoying not to get a proper sleep. As soon as I open my eyes they are gone. All day time perfect! Around that time that this buzzing noise started I was having acid reflux at night for eating late and I was taking at that time of my simptoms Acid Controller pills (famotidine 20 mg) to get better sleep; and I was having really but really bad nightmares that I wanted to wake up so bad. Any advise!? Any case like this out there? How to fix it?,2009,2009,33,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I need to know if someone else has ever experienced a number like mine was today 135/103? What exactly does this mean? I have always had a normal BP reading and then about 3 wks ago went to the doctor due to Sinus Infection and BP was 152/112!! It seemed to calm down and then I went back today and it read 135/103; what in the world is happening? I am terrified about that number. I was given a perscription which is an ACE/Diuretic (Lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide) I have never had to take any meds like this and was wondering should I be concerned more with the meds or the High bottom number? I do smoke and trying to quit( it is hard ) and also will start back on my exercise program; can anyone offer any solutions besides meds which I don't want to have to take?,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have recently been prescribed Verapamil for migraine prevention but I'm also taking Norvasc. Should these medications be taken together? The Norvasc was prescribed a number of years ago by a different doctor for Migraine prevention. It hasn't helped my migraines but I've continued to take it. Since they are both blood pressure meds; I'm doubtful I should take both.,2011,2011,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 56; had one drug eluding stint placed on Feb 12 in upper LAD with 90pct block. Microscopic damage to the heart muscle still have ejection fraction of 60pct. This was called a NSTEMI This is my first problem ever. I refused a beta blocker and lisinopril becasue pre and post stent I have never had HIgh BP or tachycardia. I did take new aspirin regimen of 81 daily plus 75 of Plavix and Lipitor for a previously known High cholersterol I had refused to treat. Question is. Why ace inhibitor and beta blockers when I am not presenting any problems of HBP or HR?,2013,2013,56,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Well; diagnosed just a little over a year ago; and other than the initial bout of repeated UTI's; I am relatively symptom free...but then again; perhaps not. I checked this out at the time but it truly scared me more than helped. I was diagnosed with prehypertension the same time I was diagnosed with MSK (by IVP which was the most miserable thing I have done in my life!) and pretty much just thought the pre hypertension was related to menopause. Dr. put me on 10mg of Lisinopril. Check up this week revealed that it was still high - though there were valid life issues such as an unanticipated and last minute mandated trip to India (I live in Michigan and have traveled no where) the very next week which meant 5 immunizations just prior to the blood pressure check. I have also noticed my hair starting to fall out (not a good thing) and have spent much of the morning looking at MSK. I must admit; I do feel bad; because if I have stones; I am not bothered by them...or at least not yet. My Dr. told me when I was diagnosed that I didn't have to be concerned with any foods to avoid and gave me a prescriptio for an antiobiotic that I could take whenever I felt an UTI coming on. So far; I haven't even had to do that. Basically; I guess; there is no real question. Just an introduction; I suppose. Oh; my nickname stands for the standard who; where; why; how and when; thoughts we all must ask ourselves when getting the diagnosis.,2011,2011,56,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi Folks; I recently visited a Cardiologist due to experiencing left sided chest aches. This is not the first time I have visited a Cardiologist as I underwent a Nuclear Stress Test in 2010 (Which came back normal) Continuing to experience the aforementioned chest discomfort I visited another Cardiologist as the former had relocated his practice to another state. Anyway; this time (two weeks ago) I was given yet another Nuclear Stress Test and an Echo. Went back to the doc and received what I perceived as good news / not so good news. Normal Nuclear Stress Test; and “Moderate” thickening of the heart muscle. That is all I remember unfortunately but if I understand correctly this is called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy correct? Anyway; I am a 41 year old white male; no diabetes; no kidney issues; and take Lisinopril and Cardizem. Doc says he wants to see me a couple of times a year for BP / weight check (I’m kind of a big guy) Question is: Do I need to freak out about this? Or is this something that comes with age etc.,2011,2013,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I always had labile blood pressure after the birth of each child. It jumped up 10 180/110 and stayed for months even with meds. I am done with kids and finally got my bp stabilized on 10-12.5 lisinopril. However even then it has it 's ups and down. I am out of breath often and small activity can drive my bp back up to 180/100 until I sit down. 8 months ago I had a MS relapse; they thought it was a stroke. At any rate my bp dropped to 110/70 without meds. It stays stable for 7 months. Now it's back up and higher doses do not make a difference. I feel so bloated and full; I went to the GYN I do have several fibroid but he didn't seem to see a need to remove my uterus. I been having abnormal sweating and nausea. My blood pressure now is 132/102 or 120/99. If i get up and walk around it jumped to 155/107. All my doctor wants to do is unload heaps more meds on me which will make me ill. I am at my wits end.. tired of feeling tired and out of breath; headaches; chest pain and fullness AND this crazy BP. The doctor wants to keep increasing the dosage in my BP meds; be it lisinpril; benicar etc.... the increase in dosage doesn't make a difference all it does it make me out of breath;,2012,2013,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril. About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG; X-rays; MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and gave me one dose of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist. Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg); Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment. Thanks.,2014,2014,69,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am on 10mg lisinopril and 12.5 of a Diuretic. My fingers have been swelling up so bad the last 3 months to the point I had to have my rings cut off. My doctor doesn't seem concerned; just gave me another Diuretic 12.5 to take it when I swell up again. Will that lower my BP a lot or make me feel weird? I never heard of anyone taking that much unless they have CHF. I am a little concered why my fingers are so puffy all the time.,2009,2012,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Age: 28 Height: 6' 1" Weight: 165lbs Gender: Male Medications: 10mg Lisinopril Smoker: No Current Medical Issues: Mild Hypertension; and Chest Pain. I have been experiencing these symptoms for the past 6 months. As my title states I am concerned about a particular measurement I noticed while reviewing my test results. Here is the test results in total: CALCIUM SCORING: LM: 0LAD: 0LCX: 0RCA: 0Total calcium score = 0 The coronary circulation is right dominant. There are no anomalies of the coronary artery origin or course. Left main coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Left anterior descending coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Left circumflex coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Right coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Heart:The left ventricle is normal in size. The left ventricular myocardium is homogenous in appearance; there is no hypertrophy. There is no intracardiac thrombus. No congenital abnormalities noted. Valves:All valves appear normal. There is a trileaflet aortic valve. The ascending aorta measures 3.6cm at the level of the sinus of Valsalva and 3.0cm at the level of the main pulmonary artery. Pericardium:The pericardium appears normal. There is no pericardial effusion or calcifications. I am concerned about the size of my ascending aorta as it seems large considering based on my research it should be no larger then 3.0cm. How concerned should I be about this? Should I immediately cease strenuous activities? Any advice would be greatly appreciated; thank you.,2018,2018,28,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,So lately I have been having this pain in my right temple. It's kind of on my brow ridge on the right side. I guess you could say it is where my brow ridge is ending on the right side. Anyway; lately I have been getting sharp pains there. They go away in about 30 sec. and usually happen when I stand up and get a head rush. It only happens every once in a while but it always freaks me out. About a month ago I got a CAT scan done because of this and other headaches. The doctor said my CAT scan came back totally normal. No signs of anything bad. Is that good enough? I don't want to go in there and demand another CAT scan or anything. Should I only be concerned if it becomes more frequent and more intense as well as longer lasting?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history? Thank you.,2009,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi Dr. Lupo; I have a few questions about hyperparathyroidism and taking thiazide diuretics and I'm really hoping you can help! I was diagnosed with genetic/weight-related hypertension in August 2006 at 20 years old. At the time I weighed 210 pounds and it was decided I should go on medication to attempt to resolve the problem. I started taking Lisinopril (10mg) and Triamterene/HCTZ (25.5/37.5) and my blood pressure began to creep down to normal. About 8 months later (April 2007) I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's after several years of elevated TSH values and symptoms. I dropped about 45 pounds in the year after starting Levoxyl and was running regularly (have completed 5 half marathons in the past year and have kept the weight off). However; my blood pressure still runs on the high side and has yet to stabilize even with the increased exercise and weight loss. Last fall (2008) my endocrinologist ran a basic metabolic panel and found that my calcium was elevated and my vitamin D was low. She followed the "watch and see" approach to see if things evened out. My labs since then have been: Calcium: 10.4; 10.8; 10.3 (range 8.5-10.2) Vitamin D (25-OH): 26; 25 (range 20-100; optimal >30) Vitamin D (1; 25): 74 (range 18-72) PTH: 45 (According to my PCP; my calcium levels in Jan/Aug 2007 were 10.1 and 10.1; respectively; with a range of 8.5-10.5). I know that being on the thiazide diuretic can increase calcium values; but I'm wondering if my hypertension may be a result of an underlying parathyroid condition. I do feel I am symptomatic of hyperparathyroidism (moodiness; loss of energy; tiredness; and my thyroid numbers all seem to be in check); but this one in particular spoke to me. Are there are questions specifically I should be asking my endocrinologist? (I just moved to a different state and am starting all over again). Thank you; I really appreciate your help!,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement. Does this seem reasonable?,2007,2012,65,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50+ yr old male; 25lbs overweight with borderline hypertension. I take 40 mg of Lisinopril daily for BP and a statin for cholesterol. I snore and have sleep apnea with daytime sleepiness. Over the past 3 months; I have been having intermittent headaches in the left rear portion of my head. The pain is a dull ache; usually about 3-4 on a scale of 10 in intensity.Sometimes it radiates down into the left-rear portion of my upper neck; but is centered in an area about the size of the bottom of a beer bottle; about 3" behind my left ear; slightly above the bottom of my hairline. I usually wake up with it in the morning; and more often than not it dissipates within a couple of hours after I get up. Once in awhile it stays with me for most of the day. I usually sleep on my right side. In addition to my BP meds I take a variety of supplements every day; among which are Ginko Biloba; N-Acetyl Cysteine; Vit C ; Lysine; Co Q10; Omega 3's; Saw Palmetto and a multi; plus aspirin. I am not having any strange neurological symptoms; nausea; faintness; etc.; but this frequent headache is unusual for me. Any ideas ? Could I have a tumor or anyeurism; do I need an MRI?,2009,2009,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI of 43.5 and a moderatively active lifestyle due to school/work. I walk 30 minutes every day; at a brisk pace. I have primary hypertension despite a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril (I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide but due to my IBS-D I ended up dehydrated and requiring FRT in the ED). Due to my HR being chronically low; I'm not a good candidate for beta blockers so I'm on Lisinopril which just can't seem to manage my BP. My average resting heart rate is 48! I have a pulsation visible in 4/10 nailbeds that coincides with my heart rate; I've since learned it's called Quickne's pulse. I can't remember the last time I DIDNT have edema in my feet and legs. Some days it's worse than others; but every day it's pitting edema. I get a tightness in my chest sometimes and I can't seem to catch my breath. I'm tired all the time. I've gone to my PCP and had several several blood panels; urinalysis; etc with no conclusive results. I've gone to the ED due to the pain in my chest and inability to catch my breath and was tucked away to finish the cardiac enzyme protocol then shipped home with some Maalox as if it was some acid reflux causing my feet; hands; arms and face to swell. SOMETHING isn't right. I'm frustrated and tired of getting the run-around. Please help!,2018,2018,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm 23 year's old. I recently began to have extreme trouble with dizziness (about 3 months ago) and was told I had high blood pressure. They put me on Lisinopril. I ended up in the hospital a month later (Christmas Day) with chest pains. They then told me they thought the Lisinopril was to blame. They took me off Lisinopril and put me on Atenolol. The Atenolol (over the course of a couple of weeks) lowered my pulse rate too much and started causing my heart rate to become irregular. I ended up back in the hospital where they took me off of the Atenolol and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide. Unfortunately; it too seems to be disagreeing with me; and we still haven't figured out what the cause of it all is. I'll occasionally wake up in the middle of the night; sometimes right after I fall asleep; with a sudden jerking feeling and a need to breathe which usually raises my blood pressure bad. This would lead me to believe I had sleep apnea or something similar; but this doesn't always happen; and the majority of the time; my blood pressure is bad during the day as well. They've done numerous blood tests; thyroid tests; heart and kidney ultrasounds; elecrocardiograms; ran nuclear stuff through my blood stream and tracked it through an MRI; done chest x-rays; stress tests; and hooked me to heart monitors. So far; everything turns up fine according to everyone. I'm still having heart pains; irregular heart beats; bad dizziness; and my blood pressure runs high almost daily.I've been living off of grilled chicken salads with no dressing and drinking water for the past three months; but even a switch in diet doesn't seem to have helped. I really hope I can figure this out soon. My blood pressure this morning was 126/110... the bottom number being the highest it has for some time; while the top was actually low for once. However; the pulse was also 110; and I was only laying down still sleeping just moments before I checked it. I also had an irregular heartbeat once again.,2010,2010,23,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I've had stage 1 hypertension since January 2012. Lately; I seem to be getting tired more easily and can't seem to do much without having to take a break every so often. Any ideas as to what could be causing this excess fatigue?,2014,2014,28,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report. Third echo since Nov 04; this at PHClinic; normal left 'side' at rest incl RV size and function. Est. RV S.Pressure; 32 mmHg (BP 158/90) inc. to 60 mmHg (BP 184/82)at peak exercise(supine bike). Ejection fraction response to stress from 65% at rest to 75% peak stress. LV end-systolic volume decr. with stress. There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'. Two weeks following my visit; new PHP prescribed Lisinopril 2.5mg AM; diltiazem 120mg PM. I track my blood pressure as advised; in the range of 145/80 pulse 75. I weigh 134lbs; 5'5"; don't smoke/drink; am 60. Exercise around the house and use stat. bike. Sometimes my BP reaches 180/95 for no reason. Worry so about all this. MBT,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Long story short. Diastolic murmur due to dilated aorta; 4.5 cm. no aneurysm or dissection; also hypertrophy of septum at top margin with potential occlusion of maitral valve. On atenolol for a month to reduce contractility and rate in attempt to decrease septal hypertrophy. I'm a long distance cyclist and notice that my exercise tolerance has decreased and having slow progress building new muscle when doing pushups; etc. Question ; is atenolol the best choice for this condition? I am asymptomatic except murmur. Stress test showed no arrhythmias; BP and pulse in expected range. Are there other meds; Does Yerba Matte defeat the purpose of atenolol? What the heck do I do to feel strong again?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi all; I'm a newbie; so if I'm posting this in an inappropriate spot; please feel free to bring it to my attention. I wanted to do the "ask the doctor" forum; but I don't really have 20 bucks to spare right now. ;) Okay; so here is my story. I am a relatively healthy 26-year old female who was diagnosed with hypertension about three months ago. It was discovered during an ER visit for an unrelated illness (allergic reaction to cleaning chemicals at work). At that time; it was 170/110; and the lowest it ever got was 150/105. They chalked it up to "ER anxiety" (even though I really wasn't that ruffled) and referred me to my family physician for follow-up; just to be on the safe side. Sure enough; followed up with family doc who found out my baseline was anywhere from 150-160 systolic and 90-110 diastolic. He had me keep a log for about a week; taking it at different times and places; and then after that I was placed on Lisinopril. Hypertension did not respond to that; so then I was switched to Cardizem LA. Still nothing; but it was a $50 co-pay; so I'll be darned if I don't finish them out! ;) Anyway; I've been feeling fine up until Friday. Around 9:00 am that day; I began to feel extremely dizzy (I blacked out for a second; but luckily came right back; still sitting in the same position I was in!) Later in the afternoon; I began feeling chest pressure and sort of an ache in my right breast area. It wasn't a sharp pain; it was as if someone was squeezing my heart. The pain was not constant in nature; but the pressure was. I also noticed that my feet and ankles were very puffy; which is completely new for me. Anyway; I headed to the Immediate Care center after work; an EKG was done and the doc was concerned about some things that he thought could be abnormal. I ended up in the ER; where a cat scan and bloodwork were done; and heart attack and pulmonary embolus were ruled out. I was told it was "anxiety" and to "go home; put my feet up; and rest." I don't know where they get the anxiety thing from. I do not have a history of anxiety; nor do I feel I have an abnormal level of anxiety. I'm just frustrated because I feel like I've been "blown off" because of my age. I just feel like this is not related to simple "anxiety." I'm posting here because I just want to know - has anyone else out there had a similar situation? Do any of you have any ideas here?,2007,2007,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,This will be my second and last question per the forum rules. I am 49 y/o female; nonsmoker; light drinker; mildly overweight. I have mild hypertension; well controlled on Lisinopril 30mg and HCTZ 25mg. Mild asthma; no meds- rarely need Proventil inhaler. About 3-4 months ago; I began developing exercise intolerance; with severe tachycardia and SOB with only mild exercise; such as walking around the block or going up a flight of stairs. My resting HR is 100-120; without symptoms. I had a stress echo; everything reportedly normal except for my post exercise PA pressure; which was 60. The cardio said he saw "no cardiac reason" for this; sent me to a pulmonologist. Had a chest CT; essentially normal. PFT's normal. I had a month long event monitor; which confirmed tachycardia to the 180's with any mild or brief exercise. A sleep study showed no apnea. Tests are pending for collagen disorders. Cholesterol levels great. I was formerly active with no problems. I have no problems at rest. Can you think of anything else that could/should be done or evaluated? Now the cardiologist is backtracking a bit and saying that the PA pressure of 60 "could be normal". Is that a fair statement? I know it can vary; but in light of the recent development of the exercise intolerance/tachy/SOB;it still concerns me. He's putting me on Cardizem (while cutting down Lis/HCTZ) to control the heart rate; and plans to "see how things go". Is this reasonable; or should there be further investigation? (I've been on the Cardizem for 2 days; resting HR 70-80 but it seems to wear off in about 10 hours even though its extended release-then I'm right back up to 100-110. Havent tried any exercise yet on it; as its been in the 100's here). Thank you.,2006,2007,49,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 24 year old male. For the past 8 months I am taking a dosage of 2.5mg daily of Lodoz(beta blocker) to counter my hypertension. Although this medicine has brought my blood pressure right back to normal; I experience the following things: 1. These days I usually have a very slow heart rate(45-50). Is this heart rate normal? It has dropped to these low levels only after I started taking the medicine. 2. Sometimes I experience a mild pain in my chest. The pain occurs after every few seconds and then fades away. It is very mild though and does not cause me any discomfort. I sometimes experience a chest pain which I can descibe as a 'pinching' pain. Again it does not cause me discomfort but surely makes me worry. What could be the cause of this pain? 3. I use a digital meter to check my blood pressure. It is always within the normal range 100-110/60-70. However sometimes it falls to something like 98/55. Is this too low?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was recently prescribed apo-lisinopril for high blood pressure. I had been getting reading lately at about 130/96. That being said; I have also been under enormous stress lately (new job; finances; child with illness ect) I am not the type of person who takes stress on; but it's been hard to ignore lately. I've been checking my blood pressure at home and usually get readings of 120/85. So I'm just not sure if I want to begin taking the pills if this is something that will pass as I find ways to handle the stress better. Secondly; I occasionally smoke a little bit of pot....to unwind. I find it quite effective....that being said; I'm concerned that this medication may interact with the pot...any input on both questions would be appreciated.,2011,2011,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I can't find the person who said his diastolic dysfunction was on the echo one year and gone the next. I would like to know how that happened. My left ventricle is right on the edge of normal 1.1 thickness and I have SOB and chronic chest pain. The heart dr said my shortness of breath is not from my heart and his nurse practitioner said neither is my chest pain and cramping. I'm on 5 mg lisinopril a day cuz I have high blood pressure and that makes me feel lightheaded and faintly . If I just stand up I feel like I can't get any air and feel like I'm suffocating. But oh no;this has nothing to due with my heart. My lungs are fine;they checked that. In 2011 an echo showed I had early stages DD but my heart dr never even told me about it. He told me my heart was fine. I was 61 then. I lost weight and my breathing went ack to normal. Then last yr I gained the weight back and the breathing problem came ack with chest pains. I went to ER and had echo and stress test. I was told no blockage;negative results. Then I asked the nurse for copies and read I developed hypertension during the stress;BP WENT UP TO 180/100 and echo showed E/A ratio .7 DD;stage 1. Now mind you;no one said anything abnormal was found. And I was not on HBP medicine either. So my resting BP is ok but when I exercise it goes way up on the bottom number. I'm on a diet and the heart dr said the million $ question is: does exercise help DD? They don't even know. So I'm exercising will make my heart stiffer sone it makes my diastolic go up when it's supposed to make it go down. This DD is like a nightmare esp. With constant chest pain and SOB.,2011,2013,62,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was taking Lotensin/Benazepril for a couple of hears for mild hypertension (~145/95) and it was being effective. A few months ago I started having various neurological symptoms including: 1) Numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. 2) Needle-stick like pains in my feet. 3) Trembling of my hands; arms; and thighs. 4) Feelings like being splashed by cold water in my legs; arms; and torso. I had some tests (an MRI of the cervical spine and an EMG/NCV) for possible herniated disk. The MRI was normal and the EMG was "inconclusive" according to the neurologist. The connection to the benazepril didn't hit me until one day. I stopped it and over the next couple of weeks the symptoms decreased markedly but not entirely. I had an appointment with my doctor and we talked about it and he changed be to lisinopril. I took it one time and about 2-3 hours after I took it the symptoms; all of them; were back stronger than ever. Especially the trembling. It's pretty clear to me that there is a cause-effect relationship here. So it's been about 3 weeks since I took the lisinopril and I'm back to where I was before I took it. I have some symptoms; mostly the tingling and the needle-like pains. I see that some of these symptoms; while uncommon; are associated with ACE inhibitors. So my questions are do you think these problems are actually caused by the benazepril and lisinopril? If so; are is the damage they may have caused permanent or should I see improvement over time? I'm obviously very leery about trying another hypertension med. I am seeing my GP doctor in a week. Thanks,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 41 yr old female; 5'3"; 130lbs and recently had a abnormal echo stress test. I then had a left catherization done and was diagnosed with "hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction". I am on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide meds of which I take 1/2 tablet of a 12.5 mg tablet daily. My cardiologist stated that the diastolic dysfunction is caused by untreated high blood pressure; but I've been on blood pressure meds (hydrochloritiazide) for over 3 years prior to getting this latest diagnosis. My question is whether or not there are any other possible causes of diastolic dysfunction. I've had other symptoms over the last few years (fatigue; weakness/loss of strength; numbness in hands/feet; dizziness; foggy memory; slight carpal tunnel in both wrists per EMG test) and have undergone a few tests (checking for Rheumatoid Arth.; Lupus; EMG test) all of which came back normal. My blood pressure has always been low; in fact too low (81/48 lately) since I've been on the blood pressure meds. I'm just trying to find out if there may be another root cause of why I'm not feeling well. I have two young kids (4yrs and 9yrs) and have actually had a doctor tell me "you feel tired all the time because of the kids". Well; I'm not buying it. Please help me solve this mystery once and for all if possible. Thank you in advance for any insight you may provide. I look forward to your response.,2007,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Started having foot pain and swelling in my right foot only. I have been to the ER and to my doctor. (about 3 years ago; I had tendonitis) At the ER they thought it was gout; but only did an xray (which only showed swelling). My doctor doesnt think its gout; because its affecting the middle of my foot up towards my ankle.(more towards the right side of the middle of my foot) It has also climbed up to my ankle now and starting to get slight pain above my ankle. I have been staying off of it by using crutches - it was to the point I couldnt walk or even put pressure on it. I can now barely walk on it and a little pressure doesnt hurt at all; but still is swollen. I am also having a lot of other issues right now; but wondered if this might be something?,2011,2011,25,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests. I wish I could have a monitor which could be activated to record an ECG when I have pain.,2007,2007,60,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I’m experiencing an intermittent dull pain in the center of my chest that feels like it’s coming from my breast bone as opposed to deeper within my chest. It worsens when I lie on either my left or right side. Pressing on my sternum and ribs worsens the pain only very mildly; not nearly as badly as with the bruised ribs or pleurisy I’ve had in the past. I also have “skipped-heartbeat” palpitations. Sometimes when walking briskly; I have a palpitation that produces the sensation that my breast bone is being struck as if by a hammer from behind. Background: I’m 56 years old and have experienced the single “skipped-heartbeat” palpitations for many years; which my doctor has concluded are benign. I’ve also experienced intermittent episodes of lightheadedness and faintness (without passing out) for eight months. Recent tests; all within the past five months; all normal: Treadmill and cardiolite stress tests 24-hour holter monitor EKG Echocardiogram Blood studies; including TSH Chest x-rays CAT scan (head) Ultrasounds of my liver; pancreas and gall bladder. I’ve also suffered from heartburn for years; so I know what that feels like; and my current pain is not similar (I take OTC 20mg Prilosec daily; which has almost totally relieved my heartburn). Other meds are Mirapex for restless legs syndrome and 20mg Lisinopril for mild hypertension. Any clue what this breast-bone pain might be? Thank you!,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe L3-L4 and L4-L5 stenosis. The MRI report also indicated moderate foraminal narrowing at 3 or 4 disc levels; and the report mentioned desiccation at all but one of the disc levels. The L4-L5 also indicated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet athrosis. What does this mean? 34 years - 6 foot 4 inches; 230 lbs. I have episodic numbness and pain in legs; but also have this problem in arms and hands too (numbness and slight tremor). I also have abdominal pains (mostly ULQ) and fluctuation in stool. I don't smoke or drink. I'm on paxil (mood); lisinopril and small dose of atenolol (hypertension). I have taken paxil and lisinopril for years. I had two ablations for SVT in 2006 - second one caused a PE which I took warfarin for 6 months. No clotting factors. The numbness started in my legs and affects my hands and forearms as well. Sometimes I feel this squeezing feeling either in my hands or in my lower back. When I sit for long periods and then stand up and walk I sometimes get episodes of numbness and weakness that make me have to walk slow and/or sit down and rest. Also I get some strange sensations in my hands and forearms...like holding a phone my hand gets tense and heavy and I have to switch hands. Also; both arms fall "asleep" at night; and I am not laying on them. I have a stiff/aching neck for over a year that waxes and wanes; but stays sore all the time. I have had several workups before the MRI. I have normal cbc; liver blood tests; mri of head; abdominal ct; no lyme; b12; no hepatitis; no cmv; blood smear neg pathogens; etc. Normal ncv/emg Could the arm involvement indicate some cervical stenosis? Can lumbar stenosis to affect the arms? Also; the digestive issues - testing (colonoscopy; endoscopy; etc) is normal. Could this stenosis cause this? Are there any diseases that cause the stenosis or cause a more rapid degeneration of my discs? Thank you,2006,2008,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Two part medical questions : I have been treated for high blood pressure for last 15 years (was taking Atenolol-50 mg & Lisinopril-30mg). Recently; I was diagnosed with palpitations (PVC's) by a Cardiologist. (via EKG test) I was directed by this physician to start taking Atenolol (100MG) and Lisinopril (40MG) as treatment for the PVC condition. Assumption is that by lowering my BP it will eliminate or better control the PVC events. Does this sound appropriate? Since I'm very nervous and apprehensive when these PVC events occur (which probably drives up my PB even more!); would the additional use of Ativan (.05mg) or Celexa (20mg) help calm me while I deal with these conditions .... or would they conflict with current Hypertension medication?

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50 y/o female that has been c/o fatigue; been more extreme since recent bout with viral gastroenteritis. I experienced some SOB and significant edema. Seen by a physician who ran some labwork which came back within normal limits; BNP was 253; she did give me lasix for a couple days for which I dropped 14.5 pounds in 2 days. She also ordered a cardiac echo and stress test for me. Echo showed some regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valve but nothing to warrant further treatment and left atrium dilation; and I believe left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevation...again; told nothing to be concerned with. I've had episodes in the past where my heart rate has dropped down to the upper 30's and then would come back up to 50-60 range. I would say my normal resting HR has always been around 80. So; since they labwork was good; the cardiac tests were fine; my PMD said my fatigue has to be my depression. I personally don't think so but hey; I'll go with it for now. I'm faithfully going to the gym and working out for 1-2 hours 4 days (or more) a week. I work hard while I am there; riding bike for an hour; getting my HR from 130-150+. During that hour though I will see my HR drop down to 60's and then down to the 40's. It will stay there for maybe 3-5 minutes and slowly climb to 70 and then wham; I'm back up to the 130's again. To me this does not seem normal. I'm thinking this may be the reason for my fatigue with the HR fluctuating as it does and not my depression. They have resorted to giving me ritalin to take daily now just so I can function; I hate taking it but if I don't; I certainly wouldn't get anything done. Am I off in thinking that 45 minutes into biking hard and my HR is running in the 40's? I know nothing showed up in the 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill but I can't believe that captured the entire situation. I am on no medications to cause lowering of the heart rate. I do take lisinopril for my blood pressure but no beta blockers or others that would contribute to this. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Would you think a holter monitor be an appropriate thing? If so; how do you get your PMD to do this when they are set on it being depression because nothing shows up in the labwork & the cardiac tests? I do have hypothyroidism and idiopathic intracranial hypertension; type II diabetes (last A1c 5.9).,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,45 yo male. treated for hypertension for 20 yrs. two months ago started waking up with tachycardia when I changed to another generic brand of nadolol (20mg). also take lisinopril 10 mg. internist put me on cardionet 14 day monitor - showed pvcs and 6 beat run of v tach. so he doubled the nadolol which made the pvcs worst - plus had numbness of left foot and dizziness. went to cardiologist - did a 10 min thall stress to 140 hr bpm had no pvcs and good heart function. also had normal echo. still at rest was getting tachycardia with nadolol. went to ep; he changed me to acebutolol 200mg. now i cant even walk on the treadmill without getting pvcs when i use to run 30 minutes w/o them. other history...had a fib in 2006 after prescribed adderol - cardioverted. took rhythmol had massive pvcs and promptly discontinued. also in 2001 took atenolol - had pvcs until being switched to toprol xl. question: could the beta blocker meds be causing my rhythm problems? could i just do without them? note: a year ago i was running 4 miles a day 3 days a week and swimming a mile two days a week on 20mg nadolol 10mg lisinopril with no problems.,2010,2010,45,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,My husband has severe shortness of breath on any exercise; fatigue; and difficult-to-control high blood pressure. His latest echocardiogram was stated to be "normal" by a cardiologist but showed a low E:A ratio of 0.74; E peak of 0.572; A peak of 0.711; IVRT 134; DT 250. He had an angiogram stated to be "clear" but we haven't seen the report yet. His symptoms continue and are very scary. Before we decreased his sodium intake; his BP was going as high as 200/110; but his BP is still often 160s/90s. He is on Lasix; Verapamil; and Losartan. He has been given potassium; too; so his heart rate hasn't been racing like it was. What should he do from here?,2010,2010,56,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello. I am new to the board. I am a 49 year old male with moderate/severe high blood pressure. My average for a 24 period is 150/100. I have been on several medications: Lisinopril 10 mg. (cough); Valsartan 160 mg. (stopped working); Medoprolol 25 mg + Amlodipine 5 mg. (stopped working); now just Amlodipine 10 mg. Since taking the Amlodipine 10 mg. for about a week; my blood pressure keeps going higher and higher. Today readings were between 160/90 - 165/125. Also; my lower legs are sore; I have dizziness and feel light-headed; and are extremely lethargic. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a cleaner medication with better results and less side effects. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I am desperate....,2017,2017,49,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,hi. I am a 21 year old male who is 5'9" and weighs 160lbs. I NEVER smoke or drink caffeine; and I run four sessions of 3 miles/22 min. of cardio each week. I limit drinking to the weekends (and even then it's minimal); and I do not exceed 1500mg of sodium content daily. I consider myself very healthy and have never had health issues; surgery; or been on meds. nothing at all until now - just out of nowhere. about three weeks ago I had a terrible upper respiratory infection; which sent me to the doctor. he took my BP there and was shocked to learn it was in the 190/105 range; so he ran an EKG and breathing test and both were fine. to be cautious he sent me to the ER; where they performed a urinalysis and another EKG. both were fine. keep in mind; by the time I got to the hospital (10 min later); my BP was down to 156/94 or so. went back to the doctor a week or so later and my BP was still in the high range - now 170/95 or so. he wanted me to go to the ER again; but I refused - saying I prefer taking care of it there since I can't afford to pay $3000 again (I have bad insurance) for the ER. he said fine and prescribed me 5mg of lisinopril and told me to buy a home blood pressure monitoring machine. I have been taking lisinopril and using the monitoring machine I bought (Omron HEM-790IT) for about two weeks now. BP was high at the beginning; but the past week or so has gotten quite better. in the mornings and at night it is around 125/80; and when I return from school/work it is at the most 140/90. I understand the latter number is no good; but I figured it wasn't anything severe enough that an even better diet couldn't change. but again. my diet is already pretty good now here's the odd part: after a week or so of these readings being between 125-140; I went to the doctor's for the first time in two weeks expecting at least SOME improvement. after all; I have been eating extremely healthy; drinking tons of water; and taking lisinopril - in addition to the fact my home BP machine shows readings that are just pre-hypertension or barely stage 1. but when he took my BP; it was STILL in the 170s. I was shocked and he just let out a sigh of disappointment. he prescribed me hydrochlorothiazide to take along with lisinopril; and told me to come back tomorrow after taking a dose of both tonight and tomorrow. he also told me to bring my BP machine; just to compare readings. now; I know what white coat hypertension is; but I thought it only allowed your BP to raise maybe 10 points above normal. I certainly did not anticipate a growth in 30-40 points! I am extremely stressed about this situation... I'm only 21 years old; work out a lot; eat healthy; don't smoke... why is this happening to me? I initially thought it was just due to my respiratory infection; but that has been gone for almost 2 weeks and my high BP is still present. I'm a college student so I am somewhat stressed; but nothing too severe. I feel fine - never any headaches; aches; or anything like that. the only thing that's stressing me out right now is this darn BP. it just seems like I can't do anything... I eat healthy; do everything right; but still... I don't want to be on meds forever it would at least help if the meds were working when I went to the doctor's... any thoughts or suggestions? I have a lot of stress and anxiety BECAUSE of my BP situation; which just makes it worse. I really value my life and will do anything to remain healthy. it's just seems that I can't to do anything to combat this! :(,2011,2011,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times. I cannot take beta blockers and have lisinopril 10mg and dilitiazem 120mg daily.,2007,2007,60,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,my husband has a hacking cough- started in July of this year-- he has had this continue since then- he has this mostly in the early morning-- sometimes during the day-- seems to be happening more and more-- he has had congestive heart failure twice in the last year-- he also has had stints for his heart and renal stints placed this year-- he thinks this cough is not related-- just had a dr. appt and she says his lungs sound fine-- but he didn't tell her about this hacking cough he has-- should I call the dr. office - and how concerned should I be about this cough???? please email me-- if you are concerned -- Important,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Am I addicted to Lorazepam after only 2 weeks on .5 mg 2 times a day? A few days ago; I tapered down to .5 mg once a day and it seemed more or less fine but yesterday I didn't take my dose at all and then in the evening started feeling terrible: got really dizzy after some moderate exertion. Things are complicated by the fact that I also two weeks ago started on 10 mg Lisinopril for hypertension. In late evening; my heart and pulse began to race. I then took a .5 mg Lorazepam but I continued to have these frightening symptoms for hours. Could it have been due not to side effects of the Lisinopril but to withdrawal from Lorazepam? How would I taper off such a low dose? Any feedback would be welcome.,2010,2010,51,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My electrophysiolgist/cardiologist prescribed Coreg and Lisinopril for my condition. I have episodes of ventricular tachycardia; apparently brought on by a focal wall abnormality in my left ventricle. I also have atrial fibrillation. I have an ICD as well. When I mention to other doctors that I take these medications; they insist I must have high blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure and never have. My EP says he prescribed these drugs in order to lighten the work load on my heart and I think increase or at least keep my EF stable. He also says the Coreg can reduce the arrhythmia. Does anyone else take Coreg and/or Lisinopril for similar reasons?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 44 yo man with chronic refractory hypertension. I am currently taking minoxidil; lasix; lopressor; lisinopril; felodipine and K-dur (not to mention some other drugs for other conditions). Even with these meds; I have only marginal bp control. In the past 6 months; my health has declined significantly. Whereas I had been excercising vigorously for 1-1.5 hours 4-6 times per week; I cannot excercise at all now because I get winded within 30 seconds orso of starting. I am extremely fatigued and am having some trouble with mental status. There are other problems too. I have seen nephrologists and endocrinologists; all to no avail. Some of my blood work has been slightly abnormal to franly abnormal (testosterone severely low; HGH low; mild anemia; metanephrines high; etc.) but the md's all chalk it up to overweight (I am 40 or 50 lbs too heavy for my height and body type. I have gained weight on account of not being able to exercise). Recently; I was sent to a pulmonologist who sent me to have a b-type natiuretic peptide test. I got the result last night. It was 153 pg/ml. I haven't done enough research yet to know what this means. I am having an echocardiogram and nuclear scan to evaluate my lungs next week. I am a lawyer and law school professor; the sole support of a wife and three teen daughters. I cannot afford to get sick; or worse; but I feel like I am hitting a brick wall. Any suggestions or thoughts?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 71-year-old with a history of hypertension and COPD and now diagnosed with hypertropic cardiomyopathy. I had a syncopal episode in December. My echocardiogram showed septal hypertrophy at 17 mm with a hyperdynamic ventricle with an EF of 75%; with accelerated outflow track velocity outflow of 2 metersper second; corre;ating to a mean gradient of 10 mmHg. There is mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. There was no pericardial effusion. My end-diastolic dimension was 45 mm. My left atrial size was 45 mm.I had a positive tilt table test. The 24-hour Holter monitor showed runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. A preliminary electrophysiologic study was done which showed no inducible; monomorphic VT; polymorphic VT; or VF with programmed stimulation; nor could the Doctor induce any automatic VT with burst pacing. My previous medication (Hytrin and a diuretic) was changed to Lopressor; 100 mg twice a day and lisinopril; 40 mg once a aday. I remain hypertensive with blood pressures ranges from 180-205 over 120-140. The change in medication inproved the periodic dizziness and episodes of flushing and near syncope. However; I am still dyspneic on exertion This is worse after eating. DOCTOR SAYS MY dyspnea may; in fact; be multifactorial; including COPD and obesity. QUESTION: I am concerned over my high blood pressure and my short and my shortness of breath. Are these a result of hypertropic cardiomyopathy? Should I be seeing another cardiologist with an eye to surgery? If not; what is my next step.,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,An echo done early this year shows significantly improved numbers from one two years earlier. EF jumped from 66% to 74%; and LVID dropped from 58mm to 53mm. (The echo report defines the normal range as 37 - 53mm.) MVR was described as moderate in both echos; although the latest one says it may be higher due to an "excentric jet directed anteriorly." I was put on Lisinopril about 4 months before the latest echo; which I suspect accounts for the impoved numbers. I'm 61; in good health; no symptoms other than shortness of breath; but only on stooping to tie shoes or climb a hill. No problem with one flight of stairs. Given the improved numbers; is postponing valve repair/replacement for a year or two a reasonable option; or do the risks of the valve deteriorating and other problems arising make early surgery preferrable?,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello and thanks for entertaining my question. I am a 58 yo male who had CABG 4 years ago due to an LAD blockage at the bifurcation. I had what I thought was a very good risk profile with LDL/HDL of 130/60; normal BP; and a 30 year history of competitive running and cycling. Family history fairly benign. In trying to find the "smoking gun"; why I had a blockage; I considered exercise induced hypertension that I was aware of (via a treadmill) considering the 10 to 15 hours of strenuous training I maintained. I also found that blood pressure taken at my ankle was 10 to 20 points higher than that at the arm. I wondered whether I was being fooled by a low arm reading and I was really hypertensive the whole time. More recently; I was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy (vent wall and septum 15 mm)with still normal blood pressure. 6 months of 5mg lisinopril and 3 mo of 25 mg Toprol for atrial fib caused it regress to 11 mm. I have had no further problems with Afib for the last several months either although that may be due to the magnesium supplements I have been taking. I have read some recent medical journal articles talking about the difficulty of finding the true aortic blood pressure with the normal arm cuff. Is it possible that has been my problem all along? I don't seem to have any problem in daily life with the arm measured bp of 95/55.,2003,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 56 yo male with hyperlipidemia; hypertension and Hashimoto's. I think I'm holding my own with 40 mg Lipitor; 88 mcg of synthroid and 10 mg Lisinopril as well as being on baby aspirin. I thought I was having a TIA the other day (peripheral vision) so went in to see my Doc who scheduled me for a color-ehanced; real-time duplex ultrasound with waveforma analysis. The results are in; Left ICA has severe plaque with 70% stenosis(NASCET) while Right ICA has lees than 50% stenosis. Also the vertebrals have this thing called anti-grade flow. Obviously a follow-up CT-A or MR-A is indicated before we go futher; but am I looking at medical or surgical fixes? If medical; stents; angioplast or endarectomy (sp)?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My question is what does 'lung bases not well visualized' mean? In 2004 I was diagnosed with exercise-induced PH by a specialist in the field; and this was put down as being due to my high blood pressure being uncontrolled. My PAP at the time was 78. The next year I had another opinion with another very well-respected PH specialist; and he told me that he did not agree with the first diagnosis. I now see a cardiologist in the small town where I live; and my PAP at the latest echo was 31. I am 63; my medication is diltiazem; lisinopril; maxide and an aspirin. I don't and have never smoked. I exercise. But; I still have breathing problems and wonder if this is due to some of the medication; or whether there is some problem with my lungs. Thank you. MBT,2005,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,ok I have high blood pressure; anemia; and i have these really bad anxiety attacks and i have had these problems since i was six years old and when i was about 14 my doctor perscribed me clonidine and now if i dont take this pill i cant sleep at night i get sick and i throw up until i have this pill my doctor wants me to stop taking it and if i do it just make me so sick and i would never sleep what am i going to do. Oh the clonidine was prescribed for my high blood pressure and they want to change the pill but when i dont take the pill i get sick what to do?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,First "Hello" it's been a long time! Question to anyone who has been svr for one year plus! What is your ast/alt been?

Lisinopril+hypertension,My five year old daughter was found to have high blood pressure ( typically between 90th and 95th percentile) almost two years ago. She also has a history of headache and nighttime enuresis. About a year ago she developed strong underarm body odor. She has had blood and urine work; kidney work up and echo. She has also been tested for allergies and had her vision tested. None of the tests have revealed anything sinnificant other than trace protein in urine and high calcium levels. She was diagnosed with sleep apnea in March but since having her tonsils removed this has been resolved. She continues to have excessive nightime urination; frequent headaches; elevated blood pressure and body odor. Could these symptoms be related to an endocrine problem? What should my next step be in finding answers for these problems? Thank you!,2008,2008,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I'm 21 years old; male. Healthy weight. 5 years ago I was told I my blood pressure was elevated and I was having dizzy spells; anxiety; and occasional pounding headaches. When I was 18 my symptoms got worse...chest pain; dizziness; hbp; general malaise. Lymph Nodes in jaw; neck and groin became hard but not swollen; and still are. The docs diagnosed me with mono and said to rest. Though I was feeling better; sympoms persisted and blood pressure stayed high (130 to 160/70). Recently my symptoms have come back and I went to the ER one day and they kept me in the hospital for two days doing many tests...ekg; chest xray; kidney ultrasound; blood tests; 24hr urine; etc... nothing. Getting very frustrated but I'm trying to keep cool and figure out my problem. Current symptoms: High blood pressure; dizziness; tingling in hands and feet; fatigue/tiredness; heart pounding and heartbeat sensation throughout my body; forehead pressure; visual disturbances (tired eyes); slight chest tightness/pain; shortness of breath; hard (not enlarged) lymph nodes in groin and neck/jaw. I'm now on lisinopril for high blood pressure because the doc said I had to go on it even though we don't know why it's occuring. It hasn't lowered yet (i just started on it 2 days ago) Thanks for any ideas!,2006,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 32yr old f and have passed out off and on my whole life.....if I get too hot; agitated; sometimes no reason at all. Lately when it happens I have no warning. I've been to the er quite a few times for tachycardia(sinus)....I have mild hypertension.....I take metroprolol and lisinopril. I've also had SOB and palpitations. I seem to be able to do daily tasks but there are days where I feel like my arms and legs weigh a hundred pounds and it takes major effort just to function.....very fatigued like I worked out the day before......I am 112lbs and normally very active so this is very bothersome. My ekgs show up normal except for the tachy and sometimes brady too. The doc heard a murmur and requested an echo...this murmur by the way seems to come and go. THE ECHO STATES: normal lv function at 55%EF;trace MR and TR;no valve vegetations; abnormal apical hypertrophy of the apex....apex shows thickening consistant with focal cardiomyopathy......everything else is normal.There are a bunch of measurements if it helps...I was concerned over the RSVP number being a little high38.3 at rest.........could this small cardiomyopathy be what's causing my problems or should I look somewhere else? I also have chest pain with exertion.....Heart disease runs rampant in my family and both mom and dad died very young of stroke and heart attacks. My doc isn't too concerned and thinks it may be anxiety however my cardiologist wants a stress echo......does she maybe see a problem or just being thorough? I'm willng to except anxiety but I find it really hard to believe....does my age and gender account for the not being taken very seriously? Any advice or ideas would be truelly appreciated along with similar stories.,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Since the beginning of this year I have been getting pretty ill. I would feel ok one minute than the next I would have some diarrhea and some vomiting most recently I had a lot of vomiting diarrhea and when I get these episodes I would sweat profusely and get verry weak and tired. I would go to the emergency room and they would tell me that it either my diet change ( as per my Endocrinologist ) or most recently food poisoning ( I was told my white blood cell count was a little high; they didn’t give me antibiotics ) which is why they called it food poisoning or they’d say I had a drop in potassium/dehydration. I am getting so sick of not knowing what is going on and I’m sick of the pain; dizziness the weakness diarrhea and vomiting it happens every couple of months. I have had dozens of blood test 2 CT Scans one with contrast one without and out of all of these tests alls I know is that I’m hypertensive and I have stage 2 kidney damage. Has there been anyone else with these symptoms?,2010,2010,44,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My husband went to his doctor approx. 6 months ago because he was experiencing shortness of breath; irregular and racing heart beat; chest pains and fatigue. He was diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking metoprolol and lisinopril. These meds seem to be taking care of his blood pressure; but he's still experiencing an ongoing problem with his heart rate; shortness of breath and fatigue. For no apparent reason; his heart rate will jump to 130-165 even at rest. These episodes are intermittent and last less than a minute and occur several times a day. At the advise of this doctor; he stopped drinking beer; pop; and coffee over 3 months ago but has had no affect. He has had 2 ekgs both which have been normal; but yet he still continues to experience this episodes. Any advise would be greatly appreciated,2011,2011,52,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,This might be more suited to another forum but the others were closed to comments. Anyways; I'm a 50 year old male that's been having some issues with altitude illness. Last year I had a bout with hypertension as well. This may have resulted from residing at high altitude I'm not sure; but my work requires me to spend time at altitude. Since I will be returning again; I would like to make acclimatization as painless as possible. I had a physical today and my BP is normal without meds now; averaging 119/64. I was on 20mg Lisinopril and 5mg Norvasc earlier this year and they were discontinued. I've been working very hard on physical conditioning and diet to get ready for the altitude again. My cholesterol runs about 100. I asked my doctor if Diamox would help with acclimitization and he said yes; but that it would deplete my electrolytes such as potassium and that he would recommend Triamterene/HCTZ 37.5/25 instead. I'm not sure I understand why. I thought Diamox was the medicine of choice for acute mountain sickness (AMS) since it increases oxygen delivery.,2012,2012,49,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,My question concerns cholesterol values. My wife is 56 yo. She has high a cholesterol value; but very high HDL's. Specifically: TC 285 Trigly 63 HDL 82 LDL 190 Chol/HDL 3.5 To complicate matters; she does have a 2nd risk fa; in that she has had elevated BP readings in the past;(during a period of stress) for which Lisinopril had brought it down to 110/70. In fact; we are weaning her from it currently. Thus; that's only "sort of" a risk factor. Of course; even with no risk fa's; I realize the LDL is high. However; do you know the latest thinking re:witholding Rx in pts with high LDL if the ratio is <4 and the HDL is very high? Or; where I can find this info. Thanks for your time. Larry Novik; MD,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have mild hypertension for which I take Lisinopril. My doctor requires that I have lab work every year or so to monitor my cholestrol & HDL/LDL as well as ALT and Triglyceride levels. These were all fine last year (HDL was at the low end of normal). I also have a history of endometriosis and last year my Gyn put me on Jolessa because I increased pain I was experiencing. I took the Jolessa for just under a year and just stopped taking it in mid-January. In mid-February I had new blood work tests performed. My HDL/LDL were good (40/132); my cholestrol was a bit high; my Triglycerides and ALT were very high (373 and 73 respectively). I very very rarely drink alchohol - a glass of wine or beer in a month on average - and had not had any alchohol several weeks prior to this last test (and even then only 1 glass). Could the birth control pill have caused my Triglycerides & ALT to have become so elevated?,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I've been having chest pain on the left side relieved by this alpha blocker tamulosin. my R axis is really high 119 degrees and all the other axes are high on EKG with enlarged right atrium/ventricle isn't enlargement mean permanent damage to my heart? do I have some fibrosis as a result? thanks!,2011,2013,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,First of thanks for everyone who reads your time is appreciated. I'm Anthony; 22 years old 6'3 220 pounds I try to stay active (gym; walking; jogging) every other day at the least. I was diagnosed with hypertension 7 months ago with no underlying cause. Sent me to a cardiologist; heart looked fine other than a mild leaky valve. Stress test went good I did it for 9 and a Half mins. Doctor Said I was healthy. I was put on Losartan 100/mg -Hctz 25mg shortly after my Bp was over 140/80 a couple visits to the doc. It now runs 135/75 when I check it usually sometimes 127; or 142 just depends I guess. I exercise; I eat pretty healthy; I'm young and I'm really wondering how to deal with this? I'm doing all I can; the doctor has me on meds at 22yrs old; I know of all the deadly outcomes of high bloodpressure and how it increases with age. How do my readings look? What more can I do to lower it ? I have no help so I'm hoping I can get advice. Godbless,2013,2013,21,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,so here I am a 33 year old guy who has been experiencing terrible upper abdominal pain for a day or two this past weekend it got to the point where i ended up going to the ER before the work week since it was unbearable in the ER it quickly turned into a cardiac work up. ekg; double trop blood work; chest xray. etc the resident came to me and said "your ekg was abnormal; your t waves have changed and i don't think you had a heart attack and i don't think i need to send you to the cath lab" at that point i told her i had just had a CT angio just 3 months ago that showed only mild (less than 25% blockage in two arteries) CAD i quit smoking over a year ago and my hypertension is under control currently (10mg/lisinopril) my risk factors are there; but limited and i'm controlling them now. luckily I did end up getting a lidocaine cocktail that quickly relieved my GI pain; but the red flags that got thrown up got me a little curious do i really need to go back to my cardiologist after getting a CT angio so recently?,2015,2015,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50 year old man and have been diabetic for 5 years now; I have also been diagnosed with hypertension about a year ago. When I was diagnosed I was 5'9" and 180lbs. and in decent shape. Diabetes is rampant in my family with both my parents and half of my grandparents and plenty of my uncles and aunts are and were diabetic so I know genetics is a big factor here to. I have just started a diet and exercise regime where I'm eating less than a thousand calories a day( no starches; pasta or other high carb food only oats and lean meat and green veggies) and working out with weights for 1/2 hour the running for a half hour ( I can still bench 250 and run a 6 1/2min mile). My next A1c check is in June and I'm hoping that my A1c will be under 6 but half of this one will be before the diet started so I will be patient and also wait till the next and hopefully it will be closer to 5.5. I am on glyburide 5mg 2x a day and metformin 1000mg 2x a day and just started losartan 50mg once a day. Was taking lisinopril hctz 20-12.5 once daily but had some side effects that I didn't like. I was wondering if by doing this I could put my diabetes into remission like some of the participants in the Newcastle study did or if genetics might have me screwed. Has anybody else had any experience with being able to get off there meds with a lifestyle change. I know according to the charts I was overweight by about 12 lbs back then;I wasn't going to the gym at that time but I was far from a couch potato. I'm not sure what is causing my insulin resistance and hbp. I'm just very unhappy with how things have turned out. Turning 50 has caused me to rethink my thoughts on taking meds and winding up like my most of my relatives who take 10 or so meds daily. Three to me is three to many. I was hoping my biggest mid life crisis decision would be what type of sports car to buy not this. Any personal experiences with being able to get off meds or not would be greatly appreciated.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm being investigated for probable angina. Usually it is exercise-related; but yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and I had the same heaviness; radiating slightly to my jaw; but lasting for about half an hour; when I used GTN and it eased temporarily. My BP was 157/100 at the time. My GP said I should be concerned if it lasts over 10 minutes; but the stress was on-going. Do I need to worry?,2007,2007,60,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello again; I was evaluated for renal artery stenosis; it was ok. I'm hypothyroid; on thyroid medication since 92; lab work done and thyroid levels are fine. I don't drink; smoke; or do any kind of illegal drugs. All symptoms listed on previous post were conveyed to the cardiologist I'm seeing. Was on Prednisone off and on; while being weened off Labetalol.I had highblood pressure readings before starting any asthma medication. With all the prescibed medication I'm recieving. I'm afraid to take anything else. I was told I have essential Hypertension. With the information listed above; what else could be done? The beta blockers seem to work best on keeping the blood pressure down. However I'm told people with asthma should not take them. Q.How exactly do beta blockers cause problems for asthmatics? What is a similiar drug; that could be used in it's place? I feel like my concerns are not being addressed. Maybe I'm not asking enough questions or the right questions. Q. Any suggestions on question I might ask or how to approach him with my concerns. Could you please tell me how the following drugs work on reducing blood pressure? Clonidine; Metoprolol; Diovan; Tiazac; Trametrene; HCTZ; Minoxidil Thanks :> :> Have a wonderful day,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Can high blood pressure "revert" to normal or even low blood pressure? I was diagnosed with hypertension this past fall and have been taking Lisinopril 10mg. every morning. However; short of one incident of high blood pressure (165/85) early this Jan.; my pressure has been ranging from 85/50's to 95/50's. My internist advised me to take my pressure each am and if it's below 105 systolic not to take the medication. I haven't taken any all week and it's still low; too low for me as I have a history of TIA's. (I also have CAD; a coronary stent and severe aortic arch atheromas.) Could hypertension just "disappear" or could there be another reason for my pressure becoming so low?,2007,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Does anyone have experience with hyperparathyroidism diagnoses and the use of thiazide diuretics? I'm new to this board and am trying to find out all I can before I meet with a new endocrinologist in a few weeks so I know what to ask and what issues I should be aware of. Here's a bit of background info: I was diagnosed with genetic/weight-related/idiopathic hypertension in August 2006 at the ripe old age of 20 years old. At the time I weighed 210 pounds and it was decided I should go on medication to attempt to resolve the problem. I started taking Lisinopril (10mg) and Triamterene/HCTZ (25.5/37.5) and my blood pressure began to creep down to normal. About 8 months later (April 2007) I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's after several years of elevated TSH values and being incredibly symptomatic. I began feeling a lot better; started training for a half marathon; and really watched what I was eating. I dropped about 45 pounds in the year after starting Levoxyl and was running regularly (have completed 5 half marathons in the past year). However; my blood pressure still runs on the high side and has yet to stabilize even with the increased exercise and weight loss. Last fall (2008) my endocrinologist ran a basic metabolic panel and found that my calcium was elevated and my vitamin D was low. She followed the "watch and see" approach to see if things evened out. My labs since then have been: Calcium: 10.4; 10.8; 10.3 (range 8.5-10.2) Vitamin D (25-OH): 26; 25 (range 20-100; optimal >30) Vitamin D (1; 25): 74 (range 18-72) PTH: 45 I know that being on the thiazide diuretic can increase calcium values; but I'm wondering (sorta hoping; actually) if my hypertension may be a result of an underlying parathyroid condition. I do feel I have other symptoms of hyperparathyroidism; but this one in particular spoke to me. Does anyone have a similar background or experience with something like this? I'd rather not be an athletic 23-year old; 165lb woman with high blood pressure. I recently moved to a new state and am awaiting an appointment with a new endocrinologist at a major university medical center and I want to make sure I'm asking the right kinds of questions. Any and all help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been experiencing very bloated; swollen; painful; stiff ankles for about a year now. If my pressure goes up above 110 over 70 flat; then my ankles swell a lot; and it takes doubling up on all hypertension medications to break the cycle and come all the way down to 110 over 70 flat. But if I have to stay up late; or if I have a lot of going to do; or if I have to go up and down a lot of stairs; which happens often; or if I get stressed out for three days in a row; MY ANKLES BLOW UP AND STAY UP UNTIL I OVER MEDICATE DOUBLING UP ON ALL THREE MEDICATIONS FOR A WHOLE WEEK. Then I will be stuck with a week's worth of medication missing AND MY ANKLES GO RIGHT BACK UP UNTIL I DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. The doctors and the coverage have no viable solutions to any of these problems; we did cardiologist; we did hormone levels for women's health to see if that threw of the other adrenal related hormones; we did thryoid testing; we did gastrointestinal testing; we did mental health; we did orthopedics; we did carotid artery testing; we did electro-veinous circulation testing; we did bone density testing; we did moderate exercise in a chair with moderate walking; we did leg therapy to strengthen muscles and work on underused leg blood gates; MY ANKLES ARE SWOLLEN TWO WEEKS OUT OF FOUR AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING A THIRD HYPERTENSION MEDICATION OUT OF THE COVERAGE; OR THE DOCTOR. WE HAVE NO DIAGNOSIS; WHAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS; AND WHY ARE NONE OF THESE TREATMENTS WORKING???,2009,2009,50,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Went in to see the doc last week for my annual physical and he looked at my blood pressure history and decided to take me off the meds. I've been averaging 109/65 for the past year or so and he felt it was stable enough to try coming off. Since going on the meds in 2005; I have changed my lifestyle and started exercising every day and doing so lost about 70 pounds; but could still lose another 50 or so. It's been a week; no noticeable difference so far. Don't know how I feel about it yet; I've been on them so long. I wonder how long it would take for my blood pressure to increase again if it was going to. I would love to stay off them; but don't want to go back to the numbers I had before. Is it normal for people to be able to get off these meds completely? Would appreciate your thoughts. Jon,2006,2010,51,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi - I am a new member and posted this follow up comment/question to an old post from 2007 that detailed a similar situation as what I have a question about. Since it is something that I am currently dealing with and am looking for some insight on I thought I would re-post it as a current question. I am a 53 yr old female; approximately 35 lbs overweight; with high BP for which I am on several medications to control. I have already lost quite a bit of weight over the past yr (about 40 lbs) and my BP has steadily lowered; resulting in the need to decrease my dosages as I have been bottoming out at mid-day with readings as low as 90/50 and heart rates ranging from 45 to 62; depending on activity; but averaging 52-55 resting rate. I believe that I am on entirely too much medication however an additional health factor makes it dangerous to make drastic changes in medications that could cause rebound highs. I suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm in 2006 that was successfully coiled and I miraculously recovered from with no impairments or after effects. Unfortunately; my family history combined with difficult to manage weight later caused my hypertension to surface which is extremely dangerous to the stability of the coiled aneurysm. It is therefore vital to keep it under control for more reasons than heart health. A sudden spike could cause the aneurysm to re-rupture; leak; or loosen the coils that currently are sealing off the aneurysm; allowing a new re-bleed. Therefore despite a lot of adverse side effects from the BP meds; doctors are slow in reducing or changing them. My main problem now is the slow heart rate which is making me feel tired; have frequent dull headaches; and often dizzy or light headed. My worst time of day seems to be between around 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. I am on several BP meds which include 20-12.5 mg Lisinopril HCTZ; 0.1 mg Clonidine HCL; 30 mg Nifedical XL (recently reduced from 60 mg; which was reduced from 90 prior to that); and 10-6.25 mg Bisoprolol HCTZ. These are FIVE different drugs. I'm honestly surprised I don't have more side effects. My question is; does anyone know which of these drugs would be the biggest cause of the slow heart rate? I have read that some BP medications are known to cause slow heart rate as a side effect however have been unable to find which ones. My doctor agrees that they are what is causing it however we have already had one episode of rebound hypertension when attempting to remove just the HCTZ ingredient. The gradual reduction of the Nifedical XL has been symptom free however it has not reduced the midday low readings and slow heart rate; either. If anyone has any further insight on these drugs and their side effects I would appreciate it. Thanks!,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels "weaker" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Was hospitalized after colasping at home with extensive bilateral pulmonary embolisms. Had total knee replacement 9 months prior and complained of pain in calf & thigh several weeks post-op. History of DVTs in lower legs while pregnant 32 yrs ago. Any chance clots could have formed in surgical leg; hung out and then traveled after all that time or could I just be of those people whose body has that unfortunate clotting factor? Had nasty side effects from Coumadin; now on Xarelto. Hemotologist plans to do repeat CT scan W/contrast in 6 months. Planning to keep me on Xarelto for 9 months; then once discontinued; do testing to check for that clotting factor. Still having chest pain; mild shortness of breath; coughing and BP is unstable. Have been taking Lisinopril 20mg BID for 2 years and now they've added Metropolol 25mg BID to keep heart rate down. Yesterday; I hit 165/96 and that was with bed rest!

Lisinopril+hypertension,Are connective tissue disorders autoimmune disorders? What types are there? Right now; doc has me diagnosed connective tissue disorder not otherwise specified; though she thinks it's possibly mixed connective tissue disease since I have overlapping things. Have to go see different specialist farther away from home; hoping to get better diagnosis; referred by my primary care physician to this new rhumatologist. I really hope the hour drive up there is worth it; though the appointment won't be for another couple months. Have had joint pain and fatigue for last about 15 years; since I was 18. For awhile; the docs thought it was all in my head; and then they thought lupus; then fibro; then lupus; and then fibro again. Now they think it's a connective tissue disorder because of positive ANA; extremely high SED rate of 60; and other positive tests I can't remember everything my head is so swimming but they think i have other organs involved besides the joints. In meantime; doc is keeping me on Lyrica because it has helped with my joint pain and raynauds syndrome symptoms. And am taking ibuprofin for the inflammation. Also got diagnosed with type II diabetes; so doc is focusing on that right now first before the other stuff. *sigh*,2007,2008,107,Female

Lisinopril+hypertension,I went to the doctor because my blood pressure stays about 220 / 130 without medication. He prescribed lisinopril. I told him that I preferred a different medication; because sexually active women of reproductive age who are not on birth control are not supposed to take lisinopril. He told me that I was "being a bit ridiculous" and said; "you should trust your doctor." He refused to prescribe anything else. I have been taking it for two weeks now. My blood pressure is great; but I am having extreme muscle weakness and pain (I find it hard to walk across the room); I have large bruises appearing all over for no apparent reason; and I have developed a blind spot that makes reading difficult. This medicine scares me. I do not have health insurance; and I cannot afford to go to another doctor; so my choices are: don't take the medicine; and thereby take the chance on the BP killing me; or take the medicine and suffer the debilitating side effects. Which is the lesser of two evils?,2011,2011,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,For 6 months; I've felt miserable. It began; however; late last year with scintillating scotoma; arm weakness and tingling; tunnel vision; and a feeling that I was going to faint. These episodes would last 20-30 minutes. I was episode-free for awhile; then began to feel terrible with flu-like symptoms 6 months ago. An urgent care nurse practitioner diagnosed me with sinusitis and administered a corticosterioid injection with a round of Clarithromycin antibiotics. For a few days; I felt wonderful and on top of the world. Four days later; I had another episode of wanting to faint. I did not; yet it was everything I could do to steer away from the perceived reality that I was about to die. I literally feared for my life as I counted 1-100 simply to keep my focus. Things went progressively downhill after that episode. I went to the ER that evening with a blood pressure of 150s/115; pulse 125-150. The ER doctor administered a 100mg prescription for Metoprolol. Prior to that; I was only on .88mcgs of Levothyroxine for Hashimoto's Disease; along with 1000mg of concentrated Garlic extract. I had never had excessive hypertension; with an average blood pressure reading of 130s/70s. (Side Note: One year prior; I was having significant heart palpitations; which were checked by a cardiologist via ECG; 24-Hour Holter; Stress Test; etc. The results came back inconclusive for any damage or anything to worry about; other than PVCs and a need for weight loss/exercise.) After being on such a high dose of Metoprolol; within 2 weeks my blood pressure was still higher than before the meds (around 140/90) and the side effects were terrible. They included: dizziness; light-headedness; excessive fear; severe anxiety-like symptoms; feeling of doom; excessive tiredness; weakness; severe muscle twitching; leg swelling; stabbing pains under ribs; headache...and again; I cannot overemphasize the feelings of anxiety; which I interpreted as heart attack or stroke symptoms. They were mind numbing. I was afraid to drive; afraid to stay away from home; afraid to be in public; for fear of something like my own death occurring. To this day; those symptoms exist; to a lesser degree. After about a month on Metoprolol; I found a primary care provider (previously I did not have one); but was only ever given an appointment with a practitioner. Having been in practice only 3 months; they removed me from Metorpolol because of symptoms and a sluggish heartbeat; along with the fact it wasn't doing much for my pressure. It was replaced with Lisinopril; and I was told to followup in 3 months...3 months! I knew I couldn't wait that long. Almost immediately; I switched primary care providers hoping to see a physician. Again; I was assigned a nurse practitioner who lowered the Lisinopril dosage to 2.5mgs and told me I could not be having the symptoms I described; that "it's in your mind." Symptoms from the Lisinopril continued; the dizziness became more severe; and the severe "spurts" of anxiousness continued. It would feel like an adrenaline rush from the back of my neck; upward to my head; like hot water rushing over me; then I would want to run; literally; because I was worried about passing out or feared death. It was pure fear. Finally; I obtained doctor's permission to discontinue the high blood pressure meds altogether. Within a week; I could time the feelings of anxiety; which began to decrease more and more. The dizziness and most other symptoms subsided; except muscle twitching. For 2 months; I've been without medication; other than Levothyroxine and Garlic. My blood pressure maintains itself at either excellent or prehypertension levels; dependent on work stresses; activity; etc. My current problem is that I still feel sluggish; sometimes slightly anxious to a lesser degree (which I never did before all of this); and now there are continued muscle and neck pains; sometimes to the point of "am I having a heart attack." I have also developed something akin to GERD. Not a lot of acid reflux; but stomach pain that can be severe. My thyroid levels; MRIs; pituitary MRI; adrenal levels; chest x-rays; WBC; RBC; ANA; RA Factor; all came back normal. The only thing is; during this period of time; my Sed Rate and CRP levels raised from normal to very high (29 and 13.2 respectively). However; my practitioner; my endocrinologist; and a rheumatologist each say those two results are very "non-specific." No further tests have been ordered. Where could all this be coming from? Anxiety? Personally; I don't believe so. Stomach issues? Possibly. Cardiac issues; despite normal testing? Very possibly; I believe; especially since I've been pill free for all this time and still have PVCs that will make me dizzy or cough. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.,2016,2016,,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My throat is tickly and itching; my eyes are watering and I am coughing uncontrollably again; and It is wearing me out. Sometimes I have to cough real; real hard in order to "SCRATCH" that itch; it helps temporarily. I really dont know what it is. I never use to be sick with colds; allergies; or nothing of the sought. I was 53 years then when It started and now I am 57. I am thinking it may be my immune system is low. I had aids tests; and chest x-rays; etc. I have HTN. I am now slightly overweight. I used to smoke on off 1/2 pack of cigarets a day since age 13; until I stopped in Nov 1998 at 48. Well; now the coughing has started again last weekend after a 4 month break. This problem initially started in the spring of 2004. That time I knocked down my walls of my 1958 house for remodeling; without a mask on. I also; at the same period; took a night job sleeping sometimes on a couch in another house as resident manager for disabled people. The process.

It causes my throat to hurt and get scratchy. HELP; I FEEL LIKE WRINGING MY OWN NECK and it is driving me and everyone else crazy. OH; and NO ANTI BIOTICS; allergy; nor cold medicines work. HELP.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi All; I am a 26 year old male that has been struggling with high blood pressure for over a year now. In that time I began exercising; eating better; and reducing salt from my diet. I've lost around 40 pounds since February of this year. My blood pressure has improved but not by what I was expecting. I used to have blood pressure averaging 135/85 but it ranged from 125/75 to 150/95 at times. Now I am usually around 135 on the systolic number and 80 or below on the diastolic number. I've had good improvement on my diastolic number. However I'm not happy with where my systolic number is. My systolic number is usually 130 to 140. I don't understand why; I eat virtually no salt in my diet. In fact I'm probably not getting enough salt in my diet. I really want to see my systolic number 125 or lower; but even under 130 consistently would be OK. No matter what I do I can't seem to improve my systolic number. I am not on any blood pressure medications. I took Lisinopril for 2 weeks and then went to the ER for heart attack like symptoms. I had the full works of tests done which determined my heart was healthy but did not determine the cause of the symptoms. My doctor took me off Lisinopril and I haven't been taking medications since. What is really confusing is the instability in my blood pressure readings. For example I could take my blood pressure at 130/80 and then 10 minutes later it will be 140/75 with no change in activity or posture. Then another 10 minutes later it might be 125/80. Anyone struggling with something similar or have any advice? My blood pressure isn't awful; but at 26 years old I want to get it under control now so it doesn't worsen over my lifetime.,2014,2014,26,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather "sloppy" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms? Should I reduce it more slowly...over weeks or even months?,2011,2011,43,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,im a 43 year old male. have been healthy my entire life. have exercised 3-5 days a week (bicycling) for 20 years. currently way around 186. have never done a single drug in my life; not even smoked pot. never smoked; rarely drank a glass of red wine before; no alcohol at all now (beta-blocker). in march 2010 i crashed on my bike and had my first ever visit to a hospital in my life (well since birth). i ripped open my knee on some gravel and needed to get it sewn back up. upon admitting me in triage; they took my BP and asked if i have high BP. i was like i have no clue. dont even know what is normal or what the numbers even mean. so the sewed me up and sent me on my way and advised that i see my primary doc (i never get sick so it had been 3 years since i'd seen a dr. so i made an appt with a new dr. and told him the ER was concerned with my BP. he prescribed a low dosage of Lisinopril which i began taking immediately. he ordered several blood tests (cholest; etc) and asked me to come back the following week. the Lisinopril began making me feel ill almost immediately and made it impossible for me to sleep so i stopped taking it after the 4th day. the following week; i returned to my dr to go over my test. he looked them over; told me i was as healthy a person as he'd seen and told me to forget about taking the Lisinopril and get back to my normal life as before. that very night; while lying on my sofa watching the Lakers game; and for no apparent reason; the left side of my face went numb. i had purchased a home BP monitor the week before. so after getting up and trying to "walk it off" assuming my face had just fallen asleep; i took my BP. it was in the neighborhood of 270/170. knowing this was very bad; i jumped into my car and drove the the hospital 3 miles away. 2 days in ICU; every test known to man (CAT; brain MRI; echo; ekg; every blood test; etc). The diagnosis was that i had a minor TIA and was released and told i have hypertension. before this; i had never even heard of a TIA. to answer the next question; there is not really a family history of hypertension. both parents are now on BP meds; but but are near 70 so that's expected. i was started on Toprol 50mg which i took once a day. i then began seeing a cardiologist. again; endless tests (including stress test) found nothing abnormal. my meds have been changed a bit; i now take Exforge 5/160; which is Norvasc and a water pill in one pill; and for the past 4 months; i've been taking Bystolic 5mg in the evening. i've accepted the fact that i will likely be taking meds for the rest of my life. i've lost around 8 pounds in the past 4 months by changing my diet. i stopped all caffeine way back in April and stopped drinking even red wine once i was put on the beta blocker as im told you cant drink while on one. for the most part; my BP has seemed to be fairly stable and in the "normal" range. that said; a couple of times; and for a few days straight; my BP jumps 10-15pts and remains consistently higher for a few days. this happend back in August; and i went to my dr and he told me to just ride it out and see what happens. i did; and it settled back down; even to "low" levels of 112/72 (by my standards anyway). then; about 16 days ago; by BP spiked up again. i began feeling like i was getting the flu. my symptoms were dizzyness; slight nausea; slight weakness/lethargy; trouble getting to sleep; and the most baffling; extreme cold flashes; where i can not get warm no matter what i do. last week i had plans to go to hawaii; and decided to go even with these symptoms as i figured i could get better in the heat. i spent 2 decent days there; then on the night of the 7th; i had one of these cold spells that i could not shake. if you cant get warm in hawaii; somethings wrong. after about 1 hour; i ended up going to the ER in Kahuku to see if they could help. but before i left; i took 2 Xanex. they took my BP in the hospital and it was only slightly elevated; no fever; etc. they took some blood and urine samples and did a quick test. the only result they found was slightly elevated white blood cell count. so im not 16 days in and im not getting worse; but only feel slightly better. last night i had another of the freezing episodes; which had me contemplating heading back to the ER; which i did not. i did however; take 2 Xanex; and after about an hour; began warming up and feeling slightly more "normal". i did meet with my primary doc on Monday and told him i wanted to be tested for everything that this could possibly be. on Tuesday; they took a few vials of blood to do some tests. however; ive been through this so im not sure how much confidence i have in them finding anything. to say it's frustrating is an understatement. my life has been turned upside down. so; my question. could this really be Anxiety related??? the only reason i ask; is that it seems that the Xanex calms me. im not sure if it's really the Xanex or just the process of the cold flash running it's course. or do all my symptoms add up to something bigger? i honestly dont care if it's something bad; but im the type of person who wants to know. sorry for the long message. any advice would be greatly appreciated.,2010,2010,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,You may not be able to answer this; but I thought I might run it by you. Suppose someone developed exercise intolerance and SOB in May; and noticed at that time they had tachycardia at rest to about 110-120. Finally went to the doc in Aug and had a stress echo that showed post exercise PA pressure of 60. Had a full work up with CT Angiogram; PFT's; sleep study; lots of bloodwork for AI diseases; venous dopplers; everything neg. Suppose this person had been put on Cardizem; and wham! No more shortness of breath; and resting pulse is usually mid 90's; sometimes lower. Good exercise tolerance unless its something really strenuous. Yesterday our fictitious patient had another abbreviated stress echo; where the doc just looked at the pre and post exercise PA pressures and pronounced them normal. Said just to carry on with the Cardizem; that he thinks the person is just intolerant of the tachycardia and that is why the person had the SOB and exercise intolerance. He admittedly does not know why the person developed this tachycardia; and seems disinclined to investigate furthur. Theoretically; the person would be happy to leave this alone; but she does question why a previously healthy active 50 year old nonsmoker would develop resting tachycardia; SOB; and exercise intolerance with elevated post exercise PA pressure in the first place. He just shrugged his shoulders when asked. Something inside me says a person shouldn't have to take a pill simply to be able to walk around the block. Is another opinion in order? Suppose the person had another pulmonologist is equally disinclined to do anything more; and she doesn't want to become one of "those" patients who go around insisting there must be something wrong with me. Do you have any thoughts or other ideas? Thanks; theoretically speaking; Peek,2006,2007,49,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been put on 50mg of Atenolol and I have been on it for a month for Supra Ventialar Tachycardia; I take it at 9:00PM and within the 1st 3-4hrs of taking the medicine my heart rate goes down to the Mid-50's Is this Normal? or Should I be concerned and I have no symptoms. I already asked my Heart Doctor and he said that could be a normal reaction to the medicine. I am very nervous and concerned about this. I would like to get another opinion about this.

Lisinopril+hypertension,My blood pressure has two different readings when taken from both arms simultaneously. The difference sometime can defer as much as 10 mmH. For example; from my right arm it reads 140/86; but my left arm reads 150/94 and it has been quite consistantly different between 5-10 mmH. Another question is; I am currently taking COSAAR 50mg to control my Blood pressure and after a couple of months; it seems that the medication has no effect on me. I was wondering whether the 100mg COSAAR is actually twice the 50mg dosage coz I am currently taking 1/2 tablet of 100mg instead of the 50mg tablet; due the cost different.,2009,2009,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi guys; My general practitioner and I really don't mesh! I've been going to her for maybe 11 years; I haven't really seen her many times but every time I have RECENTLY; she seems agitated. She yelled at me for filling medication from the ER; even tho I called and asked the staff BEFORE I filled it the next day; I was prescribed Loratab 5 mg; Flexeril 10 mg and Voltaren. When I went into my next appt. I told her I went to the ER and that I had called and the staff told me that if you had a problem with them you would've called. She looked through the report and the medications; asked me what I had filled; I told her the Flexeril and Loratab; I didn't fill the Voltaren because it was 45 dollars. She said "They didn't have a generic?" I said "that was the generic"she said "there is no way" and she wrote in my file "Didn't try this medication"; and she asked "So; you filled the loratab?" I said yes and she was obviously angry; I told her that did help more than the Ultram and she yelled "Well you don't want to be on those the rest of your life!" I went ahead and filled the Voltaren when I had the funds just to see how it helped; it made me puke so I never took it again. She was once caring; once she couldn't diagnose me; she thought I was full of it. She refused to refill my ativan and once she referred me to the Neuro; she refused to refill ANY of my medicines. She waited until I ran out of medication to tell me she would no longer be filling my prescriptions. I DID take Lisinopril for high blood pressure; I called and said I need a refill of that and she had the Nurse ask me "The doctor wants to know if you really still need the Lisinopril?" I said "Well why wouldn't I? I've been taking it for months; I would assume that if I didn't my blood pressure would go up again; right?" and she said "Well check your pharmacy by 5" which it was never called in. So how do I go about switching doctors? I want to switch before I have to go back to her; how do I switch a doctor without a reason to see a doctor? (i.e. visiting the doctor because of a sickness) What do I do? I have NO experience with this; I just refuse to go back to her; I would rather be horribly sick for weeks than to deal with someone that is really rude to me and doesn't believe me. (BTW; my neuro had diagnosed me with Small and Large fiber sensory neuropathy; with obvious proof) Thanks guys :),2009,2009,21,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I'm 53; male; not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol; until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago). I found the combo effective; regular monitoring showed BP controlled; no side effects. about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy; standing up; and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However; dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril; then stopped another quarter; then completely. Monitored my own BP; went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed. However; my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise; and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion; dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff; which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative; although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work. I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'. I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months; and is it a coincidence that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia; and has done a MRI of my head (still await results). I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling; almost numbness; (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse. I don't think I'm going to keel over; but I just cant understand the chain of events. My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down. Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's; yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose. I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks 'your fine'; but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed. Can high blood pressure resolve like this ? Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ? The neurologist has recommended duloxotine; which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :( Thanks for reading,2014,2014,52,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Several weeks ago I developed a "thumping" in my left ear that occurs most often at night when I wake up from sleep during the night. It occurs more often if I am sleeping on my left side. The thumping occurs in patterns of two and can repeat several times before ending. During the day it may occur once; twice; or not at all. I believe that this is caused by a muscular contraction either in the middle ear or the throat. Sometimes yawing can bring it on; other times not. I had a middle ear infection which cleared up prior to this. My ent put me on Nasacort AQ which I have discontined. Additionally; I have begun weaning myself off Klonopin (a benzo) when this whole thing began. Are the two possibly related? If not what is the cause? I have seen my cardiologist and had a dopler study of my carotids which proved to be negative. I do not have hypertension. In summary; I don't know if going off the benzo is the cause; or if something like this arises at random. What do you suggest that do. I have made another appointment with my ent.,2006,2007,63,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I posted this for the doc; but did not get the answers I had hoped for...perhaps my expectations were too high. I am so depressed so I thought I would try the forum here. Some history; I am 33 year old male; 6'4" and 238 pounds. I have had 2 ablations for AVNRT SVT tachycardia last year; May and July at UPMC. After the second procedure I developed a PE. I was on warfarin for 6 months and then in Jan 07 I stopped warfarin. At the same time; due to daily aspirin and severe anxiety from heart issues; I developed gastric and duodenal ulcers. I went on protonix and was fine in a few weeks. In October 06 I had more abdominal symptoms; had upper GI to reveal small ulcer. I took more protonix and was ok again. I was put on Klonopin for anxiety around that time as well. I also have PVCs; but cardiologist says heart is fine otherwise. Had gastric emptying study which was normal. Had ultrasound for gall bladder/pancreas which was unremarkable. In late December; early January I started having headaches all day and dizziness blurry vision at the end of the day also. I started noticing a sore neck. Neurologist gave me gabopentin which I am unsure if it helps. In the last couple weeks I have started having terrible abdominal pain and chest pressure after eating. The pain/pressure is mainly at the center of my chest. The dizziness; neck pain; etc.. are worse also. I belch alot and it feels like there is a brick where my stomach should be. I had another upper GI today that showed no problems...other than a small hiatal hernia all is healed. I have PVCs in bunches after I eat; along with extreme fluctuations in my heart rate/force of beat etc...Also I did have the upper endo twice; one this week and they found nothing. Could this be fungal? Could this be a coronary problem (no problems with physical exertion)? I am so tired and my muscles ache all over. Please folks; give me some ideas? I want my life back!,2006,2007,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have high blood pressure. One year ago I was put on Accupril. Three months later I was switched to Lisinopril due to an insurance change. In May of '99 while driving to work; my heart began beating very hard. I could hear it beating in my head and it felt as if it could beat out of my chest. It was followed by two brief black-outs. Fortunately I made it to the side of the road without hurting anyone. I felt nauseated and had a very dry mouth. At the ER they gave me an EKG and a brain scan. When they determined nothing was seriously wrong with me they let me go. My doctor had me quit taking high blood pressure medication for awhile and see how I did. I was off of them for about 6 months when I started getting blood pressure headaches again. He then put me on 25 mg of Atenolol. I found immediate relief in headaches and my blood pressure went down. Two days ago while sitting at my desk at work; the heart started its hard beating again and I felt as if I could black out; but I did not. I stood up and walked for a minute and it went away. Neither episode occured during a stressful situation. Two doctors have told me that nothing can be done and that we can't know what it is unless we catch it while its happening. My fear is that I could black out again while driving and hurt not only myself but someone else. Has anyone heard anything like this? If so; what could be the problem? My doctor said the irregular rythms are normal; but he really didn't have an answer for the blacking out. I thought maybe my blood pressure was going to low; but he said no. I would appreciate any advice I could get. Thank you.,1999,1999,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 47 years old male; Ht.5'6"; Wt.150. Exercise regular; non smoker; occasional drinker. I take Concerta for ADD. Have taken Zocor for Cholesterol of 220 which reduced to 165. Take dyazide for blood pressure. BP runs about 145/95 without medication. Rarely add salt to food. Eating habits are fairly decent except for time interval which is very little food usually during the day until dinner time; it seems to be my best method for maintaining weight which will increase very easily. Many years ago I weighed 180 pounds. My doctor prescribed Dyazide for the high blood pressure. After not identifying it as related to medication I was experiencing erection difficulties. Not libido; but maintaining a firm erection. I went off Zocor; and Dyazide 3 months ago for financial reasons and the problem went away. I have started to take the Dyzazide againg and the problem seems to be starting again. It appears the problem is therefore Dyazide related. I am going to see my doctor in a couple of weeks and am trying to be informed before I see him. What medications for treating BP are available that would have the best chance preventing this side effect and not have other more serious side effects?,2002,2002,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,Could you please elaborate on blood pressure fluctuations. 37 y/o m; overweight; but losing. 2 a-fibs 2 years ago; none sense. BP has been hard to regulate. Meds are: Zoloft (25); Cardizem LA (180); Lisinopril (0;10;20- This is where we adjust most); & HCTZ (25). When all this began a couple years ago; I had all the test to rule out secondary hypertension. The problem is I seem to be having trouble getting the BP regulated. I know fluctuations are normal; but frustratingly; mine will go to high; we adjust; then too low; adjust; and so on. Cardio and GP have been wonderful to work with. Interestingly; losing weight so far has not helped BP (40# so far). I realize there is no magic # where weight loss helps; but??? What other factors should I possibly consider with BP changes. No fried stuff; minimal salt intake; and relatively no caffeine for a couple years now. Also non-smoker. It is not unbearable; but very aggravating. It would definitely be worse if the 2 Dr.'s were not working together or with me as they have been. I guess my question is what else can I do to get this a little more stable; and; how wide a variation in BP is acceptable before something else could be causing it? By the way; I feel fine when my BP is say 140's/90's. How do you determine what is the BP that is ideal for you as an individual? The standards are set for a reason; but are they applicable to everyone or not? Like how lower BP is fine for some but not others? Thank you,2006,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Mom 72; Singapore. Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) Daily BP: B4 breakfast - 140 PM & eve- 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,A month ago I did a health screen; which I do every year for Hypertension and never received a call regarding the lab results.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Back in December I felt a tightness in my chest and went to the doctor thinking I had a cold coming on. During the visit the doctor found my pulse to be fast (120). She sent me for an ECG which showed my pulse to be normal. They than sent me for a stress test and once again my pulse was high; but everything else was fine. The put me on beta blockers at this point to slow the rate of my heart and set up an echo. The echo showed my EF to be 35%. They have no idea what is causing my EF to be so low. I am a 26 year old female; fairly active; non-smoker; I drink a few times a year; normal cholestoral; not diabetic; slim build; low-normal blood pressure. I met with another doctor who has since put me on a second drug for hypertension. Both drugs low my blood pressure which is already boardline low. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I can expect or be doing now. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've been sort of stressing out about all of this as until Decemeber I considered myself to be a very healthy person. I feel completely blindsided by all of this.,2010,2010,26,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I had tests run on the following dates. Cat Scan in November showed 2 small renal cysts. I'm wondering first about the low GFR and (since the creatinine went up after the scan) if the dye Isovue could have affected it. Second; could the low hemoglobin and symptoms of anemia (fatigue; cold hands/feet; weakness; palpitations) be related to the low GFR and kidneys. (Iron deficiency anemia seems to be ruled out since I have hemochromatosis and my iron overload should prevent that along with all tests to check for any bleeding have come back negative.) My history is hypertension and taking atenolol and lisinopril...No evidence of diabetes Lab results for Nov/08 Jul09 Creatinine 1.3 1.6 GFR -- 44.8 (first time tested) Hemoglobin 12.4 11.8,2009,2009,56,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi i am 27 year old female..i have to children and was told during pregnancy that i i had high blood pressure. i wasnt sure if it was from the pregnancy.well after my first child it stayed high so doctor put me on Lisinopril 10mg....it seemed to make it ok..well after that i lost 25 pounds down to 155 and could stop taking the bp meds becaue it was fine. 5 years later (jan. of this year) i had another baby and my doctor put me back on bp meds because of the bp being high again. that kept it fine throughout my pregnancy. after pregnancy (still taking meds) i went to my follow up appoitment and my bp was reading 150/105 so they scared me and the lady told me i was a stroke/or heart attack waiting to happen;then she said i will be back in 10 mins to take it again. HOw she thought it would go down by telling me that i do not know. Well i took it upon myself to find a doctor (regular) and when i went to him he took me off of the meds she had me on and put me on lisiopril 10mg 3 times a day. now my bp is running 135/85 some times 140/90...and may i add that sometimes it runs low. the doctor told me that if it was lower then 111/70 to skip my pill that dose. I swear i am becoming a little overboard with taking my blood pressure i think i take it 100 times a day. is this to much and it my bp extreamly high?? i am worried i sometimes have blurry vision when it is high and never seem to get headaches.;;;;sometimes i have the floaters but not very much. what should i do in my case..........worried mother : (,2012,2012,27,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,After 13 years of struggling with pains did I find a fix in my kitchen? HISTORY: I've had seasonal type pains with spasms shooting threw my whole body; neck and shoulder pains (sometimes go numb); and some areas of my body that heats up like a sunburn. Fibro didn't fit though because I didn't have the soft points hurt. The cold weather or fluctuations in the temperature seems to make the pains worse. The last few weeks/months being "really bad"; not even being able to sit or stand for more than a hour at a time due to lower back and hip pains......Out of desperation; I think I found the cure. After reading and re reading tons of articles I saw salt cravings so I looked up SODIUM DEFICIENCY. As crazy as it sounds; I made a bowl of oodles of noodles. Added a bunch of celery salt; onion salt; garlic salt; 2 extra bullion cubes; and table salt to it. I ate it and also drank some pickle juice afterwards. MY PAINS WERE ALL ALMOST GONE WITHIN A 1/2 to a HOUR!!!!!!!! I'm going to call my Dr. and find out why or how this could be? I know with all of my BP/HR issues this was crazy to try; but; I was desperate for anything to work. Where I live the doctors don't give out pain meds and haven't for the last couple years. I'm just amazed that this SALT worked better for me than any pill could. Good for me that my heart cath turned out good last year. YIPPIE......HaPpY HaPpY JoY JoY. Doing the dance!!!!! Though not heart healthy. I do take: blood pressure meds (Triamterene/HCTZ; Metoprolol; Lisinopril; vit. E; aspirin) hypothyroid pill (Levothyroxine) cholesteral pill (Atorvastatin) Co-Enzyme Q-10 For pain. (Etodolac) plus Vit D - 5000IU IBS (Dicyclomine as needed) Any ideas on why the salt helped me please? I've had these pains for so many years. P.S. I have all of my paperwork w/bld results. Thank you in advance. :-),2008,2013,45,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 58 year old male in pretty good shape except for my high cholesterol ;triglycerides and high blood pressure. Recently I was diagnosed as a diabetic; my sugars are under control by diet. I went to my cardiologist for a base line check up. He order various tests. They found a problem on the stress test. Had a cardiac cath last week; he did not put any stents in but was told that I have 3 main arteries blocked 75%;75% and 50%. I was told that stent would not help me or avoid a heart attack since I am not symptomatic as far as I know. I was lifting weights (light lifting) using the olyptical nightly with out issues. Now I feel every little twinge or gas pain and think this is it! What do you recommend for a patient like myself for treatment? I am on 25 mg of statin; 25 mg metoporlol; 10 mg lisinopril. My diet is pretty good. What is your recommendation as far as exercise? I feel good but know I'm a walking time bomb 24 -7. Thanks.,2012,2012,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,After 11 years of treating malignant hypertension that sometimes reached 260/160 causing heart failure which was acute: 27% LVF but improved to 67% LVF with treatment of 40mg Lisinopril 4 Doxozosin 2.5 Bendroflurazide; now at 45 my kidneys are sloping off; 55 egrf weight unaccounted for. I understand it is likely that due to the afferent/efferent atriol dilatation differential I may be able to get a 30% improvement in creatinine clearance by stopping ACE. I want to do this before my GFR drops below 3rd stage failure but my cardiologist says ACE inhibitors have proven best right up to dialysis. What other (if any) drugs would have similar BP lowering effects while preserving kidney function and giving back the 30% chronic ACE inhibitor treatment generally takes away.,2008,2008,45,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I get pain in my chest that feels like a racketball is stuck in there; when I belch; it feels like it has deflated; but it will reinflate. I had a full cardiac workup and endoscopy one year ago when this issue first arose; and both were normal. A double dose of Nexium and a normal dose of Singulair eventually seemed to cure it. But it now has come back a year later; and after a week of doubling the Nexium and two days of adding Singulair; it has not gone away. Any thoughts? Wondered if it might be seasonal; given the January onset with colder weather each time. I am 39 and in excellent physical condition; my cholesterol always is below 200; I exercise every day; but I have hereditary hypertension that has been treated successfully with Lisinopril for four years. I would appreciate any ideas.,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am 48 yr old male with Juvenile onset Diabetis. About 6 months ago I had a brief spell of a-fib that caused a chain reaction of doctor visits; cariologist visits; tests that all came out normal. My cardiologist put me on metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice per day. Although he told me it was a benign drug I have many side effects including fatigue and drowsiness; some dizzyness; and loss of sex drive and ED problems. The side effects were really hampering my ability to function throughout the day. About 3 weeks ago i tapered off metoprolol of which my last dose was 1 1/2 weeks ago. everything went fine but now am having issues with blood pressure spikes; chest pains. tachy-cardia spells and dizzyness. I really feel crummy. My thinking was that I was having withdrawls from not taking metoprolol but why the symptoms after almost two weeks from taking it? I am tempted to go back on the drug to alleviate these symptoms as they are kind scary. I do not want to be on this drug and feel there is no need for it. I have mild hypertension and proir to metoprolol was taking low dose of lisinopril which I am back on now.,2013,2013,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I'm new to this forum and my mom was just diagnosed with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Her doctor was optimistic but didn't give her any sort of prognosis. He put her on lisinopril and metoprolol. Can people live normal lives with cardiomyopathy? What should we expect? More information: She is 67 years old Ejection Fraction was 35-40% She has a left bundle block that comes and goes on EKG Pulse is "excellent" She was on the stress test for 16 minutes (docs were amazed) Very healthy; active lifestyle non-smoker; no other health problems She has been on bp meds for years due to pre-hypertension readings but never had sustained high blood pressure Thank you all.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am trying to figure out what could be wrong with me. I have health anxiety but also have been diagnosed with a few conditions. First;ekg's show rbbb with left anterior fascicular block and I have also been diagnosed with having hypertension which I take meds for (Lisinopril; Propranolol and Hydrochlorot). Every once in a while; especially when I am talking or feeling a tad stressed I get a sudden pressure in my temples with a stuffy nose on the left side. I recently had an MRI which was pretty clear (for the most part) and a doppler scan of my carotid arteries which were clear. No MRA yet; but I am wondering if I am a time bomb waiting for a catastophy. I want to be healthy and have lost weight; I eat right everything but don't know what to do next.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 36 yr old female w/ history of hypertension; hypothyroid; DVT & PE (3 yrs ago). I am overweight and have been trying to lose; but so far have had little success. (still working on it!) Normal check up was 3 wk ago when MD found cause to order ECG which was abnormal. Ordered echo. Findings showed left side enlarged; MD had nurse phone to tell me & to continue Lisinopril & Metoprolol & lose weight w/ follow-up echo in 1 yr. I am concerned b/c of the onset of symptoms that I conveyed to MD prior to testing that may/may not be related. ie fatigue; can't sleep for more than 1 hr. in bed laying down b/c of coughing & shortness of breath and/or frequent indigestion/bloated feeling in chest (that isn't always dependent on laying down); I have a wheezy "smokers cough" when I laugh that has developed over past yr or so & I am not in great shape; but the shortness of breath w/ exertion seems to have increased for me. A couple of times I've had episodes where I have gotten very lightheaded & dizzy & my vision has blacked out partially. Echo results are: RV 2.0cm; LVd 4.5; LVs 2.8; IVS 1.2; LVPW 1.1; FS 38; EF 63; AO 2.6; LA 4.3; LVOT peak velocity 104.3; AV peak vel 122.1; MV peak vel 100.0; PV peak vel 107.6; TV peak vel 59.1; PAP 15.0. Are these symptoms related to this problem; and are the echo results w/ in only slightly over normal? I'm wondering if I should seek a followup w/ cardiologist? My MD has left me w/ a lot of questions that I don't know if I need a specialist to answer or to just try to see her; which will be in 3 mos. Thank you for this service and any help!,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,In Nov of 08 I found myself in emergency room 3 times due to headaches; chest pain and the feeling of passing out.. At that time my BP was 200/95... I've had EKGs; CScans w contrast; chest xrays; MRI of brain; lumbar puncture; Halter Monitor in last 1 1/2 yrs... They first diagnosed me w Migrains which the meds made me worse and useless.. Next diagnosis was and still is anxiety.. They first put me on clonazapam and lexapro. I was on that for about 3 mths.. I ran out of clonazapam and they would not refill w/o a visit and had a nasty withdrawal.. I decided to taper off both to get myself clear of all meds.. Took about a month.. After off meds I still had occassional chest pain and headaches going up the left side of my shoulder and neck to left side head.. I purchased a BP machine to monitor it regularly and to show doc on my next visit.. The majority were 140+ over 85+.. While at docs I showed him my findings and told him I thought I had anxiety combined w hypertension.. I am 40 yrs old and had my first child the month in 08 I visited the ER.. Two mths prior the economy crashed... June 08 I put my dog of 11 yrs to sleep... April 08 I found out I was having a child.. Lastly 3/08 I witnessed one of my employees die; right in front of me and 20 other staff; tragically from a car hitting her during a charity event.. High BP runs in my dads side of fam.. Both Grandparents died from stroke.. Dad; bro and aunt are all on BP meds... My doc now has me on .5 Xanax as needed and 10 mg lisinopril.. My BP is now 120+/65+ but these chest pains and tension headaches and fatigue persist.. Which the Xanax does make feel better... My question to you is: Do you see any other possible diagnosis??? Could there be a thyroid issue??? Should I get a second opinion??? I just want the headaches; chest pain and fatigue to go away.. I am now taking an avg of two Xanax a day and don't want to get hooked.... I forgot to mention I own a restaurant w 70 employees and am constantly in high stress situations...

Lisinopril+hypertension,Yes I know that there is no promised life time line; none of us are god but I was just trying to get a realistic time frame or what to expect now that I am dealing with a loved one that has been told the ejection farction of their heart function is 24 percent and they have COPD and diabetes and portal vein hypertension and their health is not the best.

Lisinopril+hypertension,My 92 year old mother's blood pressure fluctuates with medication. It will go from 175 down to 125. She takes 40mg of lisinopril 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the evening + a diuretic in the morning when it is high. Is this common for the elderly?,2010,2010,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post. I appreciate your time & help.,2012,2012,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I recently had 2 moles removed; (because they changed) at that time; the Dr. informed me that I have high BP. I was told to follow up on it. Well; I've started keeping track of my BP; I have a ReliOn meter; and I also check my BP when at the stores that have the free tests. My #'s have been very; very high. the last test I did this evening was 192/ 118 this morning 186/114 last night 190/128...got scared and checked it again 186/120 They have all been really high like these. I even went to walgreens and checked it on theirs; and it was about the same. I am not over weight (5'6" 135lbs) I don't smoke; I don't drink. I never add salt to my food. I don't like the taste of salt. ...what's strange is that lately I've noticed many things taste salty to me; for some reason. I've only been keeping track of my BP for about a week; but I do it several times a day. I've noticed a couple of times I've felt dizzy (sort of) I've also had trouble with my vision being blurry (not all the time) at what point should I be going to the ER? I'm only 46; and don't fit the usual smoking; drinking; overweight; inactive causes. should these # be considered an emergency? thank you in advance. D,2008,2008,46,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My son is five-years-old and; barring a miracle; is about to be diagnosed with MPGN. Doctors had entertained a diagnosis of PSGN; but he is 13 weeks post-strep with a C3 compliment of 15. It hasn't moved in 13 weeks. Today I am waiting on results from blood drawn ten days ago for C3 nephritic factor and C1Q. At this point; we're praying that his results don't favor a Type II MPGN diagnosis because the prognosis is much more grim. After the results of this test; I guess the doctors will probably move forward with a biopsy. Is there anyone out there who has gone through this before? I am so emotionally overwhelmed with the waiting; and the lack of answers. Any help is appreciated. Thanks! ~Andrea,2010,2010,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,What can cause a moderately enlarged heart; but normal ejection fraction. I also have almost normal Pulmonary Artery Pressure at 20.48. I did have large PE's six years ago; but they have since cleared out. I have high blood pressure spells when standing; normal BP when sitting. I get fast heartbeat sometimes also. I can get a heart rate of 130 BPM just from grating cheese. I am on BP meds to control the high BP when standing. Without meds; my BP can go from 116/78 when sitting to 170/120 just from standing up and walking around. The ER doc said it could be a heart issue causing this and send me for the Echo. The Cardiologist will not even take into consideration my high BP when standing as he says you can only get low blood pressure from standing; not high. My PCP is also stumped and called it liable hypertension. Even with 20-50 mgs of Lisinopril and .2 mgs of Clonidine; my BP will still jump to 130/95 when standing. I have caught my heart rate dropping to the 40's before and also sometimes my oxygen levels drop when walking or doing work. They quickly bounce back up again though. I failed a lung function test two years ago. I had low FEV1/FVC and low DLCO gas exchange. It showed both a restrictive and obstructive pattern; but my HRCT scan of lungs showed normal looking lungs. I also had my oxygen drip to 91 during a 6MWT on the pulmonary doc's 02 meter. So; I know it's not just a fluke with my meter. What do you think this can be from? Also; can taking Lisinopril and Clonidine cause my Pulmonary Artery Pressures to be lower? I have never felt the same since large PE's. I had a VQ scan to rule out chronic clots in the lungs and it came back normal. Can there be gas exchange problems in the lungs that do not show up as ventilation and profusion defects on a VQ scan? I feel tired all of the time. More tired than these issues should make me feel. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a hypochondriac and should just ignore all of this stuff.,2018,2018,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; thanks for taking time to read my post god bless and happy holidays! First I'll quickly introduce myself as a Male; 22yrs old; normal weight; 6'2; rather heathy lifestyle besides my diet I'll cheat sometimes. Non smoker or drinker. 8 months ago I was diagnosed with hypertension which was a shock given my physical history playing sports all my child hood and through High school. I then got an EKG which showed some thickness so we had an echocardiogram set up; which went in to show mild (LVH). My cardiologist told me of this and I was; scared confused; so I came home googled and found it was very serious. I am now on losartan 100mg/hctz 25mg; and at night I take spironolacone 25mg. My blood pressure runs anywhere from 135/80-148/92 on the meds. I cannot use a beta blocker; because late evening my resting Heart Rate gets to low 50's. But during the day runs anywhere from 80-60 resting. Typically get 80 more often after a full meal. My body's been unresponsive to the meds I've tried so far HCTZ; LOSARTAN; DIURETICS; AMLODAPINE; (can't use beta blockers) Alpha blocker (alone) made my heart rate stay above the 100s anytime I'd move it's feel like my hearts pounding out of my chest. Main concern is what am I to do when the doctor is running out of meds to try; my Bp still stays elevated; and I'm needing to keep it low because of LVH I have.... I eat a good diet; I get at least 30 mins treadmill a day; I try breathing yoga...nothing's helping :( he's suggested sending me to a hypertension specialist but I don't have money....anything I can try? I've been through a lot of tests for secondary causes all were normal. I'm hoping someone can give me some advice; I really feel like my life is being shortened everyday from this since I can't control my Bp....I'm young and work so hard to be healthy..why is this happening?,2013,2013,21,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I took a routine physical exam that included a stress test. Though EKG remained normal and I felt fine; at 13 minutes the tech said that she would stop the test because my BP was 258/78. Like an idiot; I said that my HR (158) had leveled off and perhaps I could finish the stage. 30 seconds later; BP was 271/76 (HR 159) and the test was halted. Luckily; I did not have a stroke. Six weeks later; I took a stress echo; both as follow-up on my CAD and to check for a hypertensive response. At 16 minutes; my HR of 166 had not changed for 60 seconds; and the test was getting to be not fun; so I asked to stop. Surprisingly; maximum SBP was only 176 (no change in meds). EKG and echo were normal; and I felt no pain. I would greatly appreciate it if you could please answer a few questions: Should my exercise BP be investigated further? Had I run to the point of exhaustion; would the test have been more sensitive? Would there have been a significant risk? On a stress echo a year ago (a month after a stent was placed); max HR was 176. Should I be concerned that my max HR has apparently fallen 10 BPM in just one year? Some background that may be relevant: I’m male; 62; 5’6”; 135 lb.; strong family history of heart disease; never smoked; lifelong physically active; healthy diet. I have never had any heart disease symptoms; but a screening stress test in Jan. 2007 showed 3.7 mm ST depression. A coronary CT scan was also positive; so I underwent angiography. There was 90% blockage mid RCA; a stent was placed. Severe stenosis also found at several points in circumflex; to be managed medically. I’m taking daily: HCTZ 12.5 mg; lisinopril 10 mg; Zetia 10 mg; Lipitor 40 mg; aspirin 81 mg. With these meds; BP at rest is consistently normal; last test showed LDL-C 59; HDL-C 69; TG 60. Unmedicated (and with poor diet); my SBP was typically 130-140; cholesterol as high as 315. Previously posted this (unanswered) in another forum by mistake; sorry.,2007,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi Ken Keith; I remember you from another board and you were always willing to help others. I know you have been through a lot so you certainly have the experience to offer help First ?? I have is my b/p is high at the drs. but fine at home. I finally agreed to take 5 mgs of lisinopril; my last visit my b/p was 201/77 came down to 190/70 the 2 nd check; but the dr. wanted me to take 25 mgs of metrolpo before going to bed. We went grocery shopping; came home and put the grocery away; sat down took my b/p; no resting time and it was 118/58; I retook it before going to bed and it was 105/55. this is about normal for me. Needless to say I did not take the metropolo . I was afraid my b/p would drop too low plus i have bradycardia. I realize this b/p at the dr. was high but she really harps about b/p measurements and i am getting paranoid having it taken there. it use to run about 160-170/90 in the office.. I had a c-scan without dye done before having a hysterectomy; the report states atherosclerotic calcification in the iliac and aorta; i was not told this I read it on the report. there is no mention of calcium score and my G/P said if it was significant changes the report would say so and this is common finding. I am a 69 year old female. Ten months ago I decided it was time to quit smoking and I did but I have gained 20 pounds so I am walking a mile weather permitting and up a hill; no sob or chest pain and my legs were achy when I first started walking but now are fine I don't know whether to see a cardio or not with this b/p and the artherosclertic.I had seen a cardio for a check up; a ekg and echo before surgery and he cleared me for the surgery. my b/p was elevated there but he said if it is okay at home don't worry about it. I did have my b/p monitor compared with my drs. and it was fine. Any advice would be appreciated. Line,2003,2011,69,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I was officially diagnosed with hypothyroid about 18 months ago but couldn't tolerate the natural dessicated meds (Armour). I found out about 6 1/2 months ago the reason I couldn't handle the thyroid meds was due to severe adrenal fatigue: I had very low aldosterone and very low cortisol levels (24-hour saliva test results from 6 1/2 months ago.) Of course I had high blood pressure for about 5 yers prior to this; and had been in an ACE inhibitor for 15 months. (ACE inhibitor Lisinopril---reduces aldosterone levels and spares potassium and causes body to expel sodium.) When I found out that I had low aldosterone and no longer had hypertension 6+ months ago; I quit the Lisinopril. I then followed an adrenal fatigue protocol---which included using celtic sea salt.This worked fine until 3 1/2 months ago when I began to take florinef. I discontinues the florinef after maybe 4-5 weeks becaise it made me temporarily salt sensitive and edematous while on the florinef. I was then fine without florinef and extra sea salt. But the past 2-3 weeks I seem to be fluid retentive all the time---like I am right back to having high aldosterone again. Eating high potassium foods helps for a few hours or so; then the "puffiness" comes right back. My fingers/hands/ feet go through so much up-and-down with the fluid retention and then no fluid retention I'm starting to feel like an accordion! The only lasting relief now (relief from chronic fluid fluctuations throughout the day/evening) is I took one of my left over Lisinopril tabs yesterday. I finally lost all puffiness...until it was time to take another lisinopril. I will be starting on Naturethroid shortly---since my adrenal fatiuge is now under control. Is there some kind of direct correlation between untreated hypothyroidism (mine has been pretty much untreated for years) and high or fluctuating aldosterone levels? How can a person have low cortisol levels (which I am being treated for with low dose Rx hydrocortisone) and high aldosterone levels? I know that hypo-t can cause edema. Low corts and high aldosterone---is that due to being long-term hypothyroid? I am also post-menopausal and have been on super low dose hrt. this chronic fluid fluctuation situation has me concerned. Any input would be welcome; Thanks,2009,2009,,Female

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; doc.Thank you for your valuable time. I'm 38; non-smoker. Two years ago; I had undiagnosed asthma during my third pregnancy. (I'm a former runner who was reduced to bedrest at that time). Postpartum; I was diagnosed with "mild obstructive ventilatory defect w/ improvement after bronchodilators;" and prescribed Advair 100/50 x2 daily. I've had chronic left-sided chest pain since the pregnancy; and was diagnosed w/ "endothelial dysfunction;" per a cardiac provocation cath. I'm taking Lisinopril and Inspra daily; and nitro rarely as needed. A recent echo revealed that the right side of my heart is mildly dilated. (We're all hoping that a year from now; the results will be different). Below is my most recent PFT for your interpretation and recommendations; if any. Besides a general reading; could you please explain the significance of the low FRC N2 value? What is the significance of the higher-than-predicted values? Thanks again.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50 y/o female that has been c/o fatigue; been more extreme since recent bout with viral gastroenteritis. I experienced some SOB and significant edema. Seen by a physician who ran some labwork which came back within normal limits; BNP was 253; she did give me lasix for a couple days for which I dropped 14.5 pounds in 2 days. She also ordered a cardiac echo and stress test for me. Echo showed some regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valve but nothing to warrant further treatment and left atrium dilation; and I believe left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevation...again; told nothing to be concerned with. I've had episodes in the past where my heart rate has dropped down to the upper 30's and then would come back up to 50-60 range. I would say my normal resting HR has always been around 80. So; since they labwork was good; the cardiac tests were fine; my PMD said my fatigue has to be my depression. I personally don't think so but hey; I'll go with it for now. I'm faithfully going to the gym and working out for 1-2 hours 4 days (or more) a week. I work hard while I am there; riding bike for an hour; getting my HR from 130-150+. During that hour though I will see my HR drop down to 60's and then down to the 40's. It will stay there for maybe 3-5 minutes and slowly climb to 70 and then wham; I'm back up to the 130's again. To me this does not seem normal. I'm thinking this may be the reason for my fatigue with the HR fluctuating as it does and not my depression. They have resorted to giving me ritalin to take daily now just so I can function; I hate taking it but if I don't; I certainly wouldn't get anything done. Am I off in thinking that 45 minutes into biking hard and my HR is running in the 40's? I know nothing showed up in the 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill but I can't believe that captured the entire situation. I am on no medications to cause lowering of the heart rate. I do take lisinopril for my blood pressure but no beta blockers or others that would contribute to this. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Would you think a holter monitor be an appropriate thing? If so; how do you get your PMD to do this when they are set on it being depression because nothing shows up in the labwork & the cardiac tests? I do have hypothyroidism and idiopathic intracranial hypertension; type II diabetes (last A1c 5.9).,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 50 and in great shape; I excersize at least one half hours everyday;with a mixture if cycling 20miles plus 45 mins weight training or jogging 3-5 miles and again 45 mins weight training.

Can anybody help me on this ad I worry about having a stroke. My dad has high blood presure but it's under great control with rampril 120-80. Thanks Steve,2012,2012,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels "weaker" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you in advance for your help. First I'll give a quick history: I'm a 37;male; 6'; 220lbs.; caucasian 1. Open heart at age 4 for ASD 2. Two Catheter Ablations for A-tach. Both were unsuccessful and left me with a pacemaker because I went in to complete heart block. 3. Open heart surgery at age 35 for Sinus Venosus Defect. 4. Maze Procedure performed during last open heart surgery. Successful; no A-tachs since. 4. Left Atrium measures 5cm 5. Moderate mitral valve regurgitation 6. Dilated Coronary Sinus 7. Current medications: 325mg of Aspirin daily; 5mg Lusinopril 8. Avg. BP 130/82 So here's the big question; at my last pace check; 2 episodes of A-fib were found. One lasted only 4 heart beats and the other lasted 30 seconds. One was in Jan.08 and the other in May of 08. My Ep Dr. has recommended I start Coumadin due to the A-fibs. I wore a monitor for 21 days and nothing registered. Although; I'm usually a very good patient; Coumadin seems like an overkill for only 2 very small episodes. What do you think? How long does Afib have to last in order to cause a stroke? Would it be unwise for me to take a wait and see approach? I thought maybe I can get a pace check every 3 months and see if the Afibs become more regular? I'm very active with two young children. Although I do not want to suffer from a stroke; I wonder if Coumadin is the best option for me. I should also mention that I am asymptomatic. I never even felt my A-tachs either. Thank you again and I look forward to your response.,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed as mildly hypertensive a few years ago (now 47 y/o; ns; nd; normal weight and lipid profile). I ran about 150-160/90's before; now run 130-140/mid-upper 80s on 20 mg Lisinopril qd. I feel like this isn't low enough. I recently had an MRI/MRA of my head for unrelated reasons; and the report came back with changes "most consistent of involutional small vessel white matter changes beyond upper limits of normal for patients age. Consider small vessel ischemic risk factors such as untreated hypertension." Does this mean I need better control of my hypertension? When I am at rest or in the docs office; it is always about 120-130/mid-low 80's. At work; however (night shift RN; busy unit) it runs 140-150/mid to upper 80's to 90. My pulse is rarely lower than mid 90's (80's at rest). Thyroid functions ok. My doc says not to worry; that this is fine. I say that as I work fulltime; my BP's at work reflect my usual state more than resting or office BP's. My family history includes several relatives with longstanding hypertension; stroke; MI; and aortic stenosis. What is your opinion? Aim for lower; or ok as is? What would be the next usual agent to add if a lower BP would be desirable?,2004,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am taking meds for high blood pressure..I changed my diet to organic foods; sea salt when cooking but very little..lots of fruits and salads..I juice carrots and apples 4 times a day.. using the Dr. Max ****** diet...no sweets; pop..etc...i'm eating healthy..I did the Lemon Master cleasnse...I excercise what if all of this will help my blood pressure...without prescription drugs...will I be able to get off of them...,2014,2014,50,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I take coumadin for a prosthetic mitral valve. I am trying to find a pain medication that I can safely take. I have severe osteoarthritis that is very painful and debilitating. I did take celebrex for a month which helped greatly but my cardiologist felt that it may be too great of a risk to take. Is there anything else that would not affect my INR or cause a risk of bleeding? I realize that narcotics wouldn't be a problem but I do not want to go in that direction at all. A second question; For heart failure;what is the better medication...ACE inhibitors or ARB in the presence of a normal blood pressure? I understand that there are combinations of ARB and diuretics. Are these ever appropriate for heart failure? I am looking to decrease the financial burden that I have with all the separate medications etc. but want to do it safely etc. Thanks for answering my questions.,2004,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Ok here it go's. Im really worried about my husband he is 35 years old and he is on 4 different blood pressure meds. He is on Lisinopril 10mg ; Atenolol 50mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Even with all theese meds his blood pressure is still way to high! It seems every doctor visit they add more meds. Ok I guess my question is; is it nessasary to be on 4 different blood pressure meds and is it safe? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Lisinopril+hypertension,My brother is on welfare and the doctors at the clinic have given him the following meds. Tramadol 50 mg; Trazadone 50mg;Amitriptyline 10mg; cyclobenzaprine 10mg; Hydrocodone/APAP 5mg/500mg. In addition he was also given medication for Diabetes Type II; metformin 850 mg; glipizide 5mg; lisinopril 5 mg; simvastatin 20mg; Asprin 81 mg; Ranitidine 150 mg. Additionally he was also prescribed Naproxen 500mg and Alumina Magnesia 360 ml. I think this is too much medication. Any suggestions? SMS,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,So basically since the end of October ish; I’ve had some strange chest discomfort. At the time I had recently been put on lisinopril for somewhat high BP; however I got the pesky cough that came with it and a butload of nausea so I asked the doctor if I could try a more natural approach instead of getting on medicine right away; my BP is pre hypertension; but I’m overweight and planned on changing that. So after only a month on lisinopril I dropped it. The chest discomfort persist. I’ve been to the doctors and had an EKG(thinking it was my heart)which was normal. A few times I went to the ER with stab-like chest pains lasting mere seconds but kept happening; both times they did a full cariac workup (X-ray; blood tests; ekg) and both times; normal. Most days I wake up - I feel this void or sinking feeling in my lower chest/upper abdomen area; and kinda on the left side. I’m very tired nowadays as well. Almost every day once my day starts(usually picks up at around 10-11) I have a tension-like headache that lasts pretty much all day. My chest feels weird sometimes like my heart isn’t pumping that great? Idk. I have this constant urge to check my pulse a lot; and 99% of the time it’s a normal Pulse.. the other 1% I’m usually having PVC/PAC. Yeah; I get those sometimes. Most of the time it’s just one; but I’ve had a handful of times where there’s been a string of them; like normal beat; pvc;normal beat; pvc normal beat pvc and this goes on like 5-7 PVC’s and goes back to normal. My doctor said PVC’s are usually benign; but my whole life I’ve never experienced Them although I’m sure I’ve had them because normal people have them everyday but I’ve never felt them like I do now; if that makes since? Sometimes while sitting down; my heart rate hits the upper 90s or as high as 110; When I’m laying down it’s low 60s; but it can hit upper 80s and I’ve also noticed my heart slows WAY down when I exhale. During activities such as sex or masturabtion - I SOMETIMES have what feels like a slow; powerful beating heart. It usually feels uncomfortable; and I end up stopping. Also recently; I have noticed unusual bowl movements. They’re mostly normal in size/color for the most part but I see a lot more undgiested food in my stool that I’ve never seen before and Ive seen mucus on my stool/toilet paper the first time in my life not to long ago; it’s happened a couple times now. And it seems that whatever I eat nowadays; will exit me in about 5-8 hours. I know this because some of it is undigested. Anyways; all of this has given me anxiety. I’m a horrible googler of symptoms and that makes it so much worse. So much so that it was effecting my life and the people around me so my doctor prescribed me anti depression/anxiety Paxil 20mg. I take one every day at about 8:30 p.m. and I’ve been on it for a month now. Now I wake up; same old feeling in my chest. Go to work; usually do pretty good the whole day; aside from that constant chest discomfort that I feel like I’m just getting used to now... but at the end of the day; I get home get comfy; at about 6:30-7 I start to get a loopy feeling in my head and slight dizziness; sometimes I feel nauseas; and have blurred vision and sometimes when I focus hard on something small my eyes will jerk. This has been going on for about 15 days. I’m not exerting myself in anyway. I usually just play video games or watch a movie or play a mobile game just chilling laying down or something; yet I still feel weird in my head. I’ve been told this could be a side effect of Paxil though; but idk. Some days; even during work I feel extremely dizzy; and sick like I’m on the verge of passing out kind of feeling; but that’s only happened a few times. Anyways; I’m so sick of feeling this way. I have no idea what it could be. It’s effecting everything around me; I don’t go out anymore; I’m afraid to go to the gym because I think my hearts gonna give out on me; I don’t give my girlfriend attention like I used to cause I feel like a zombie. I don’t feel like the same person I was back in like July or something. So does anyone have any input? Or can anyone relate? Any suggestions on what I should do?,2017,2018,27,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 37 y/o male. I have been an ICU nurse for 8 years and have a pretty knowledge base of cardiac medicine and have a good amount of common sense. I have had PVC's for 3 years now in the range of 14000-18000 per day. 14% or so of all heartbeats. I recently had an echo because they were getting worse and I was diagnosed with Grade I diastolic dysfunction. I sense that this is becoming more common in younger people because cardiologists are now looking for DD on echos. I have in the past 6 months developed hypertension from SBP 120-130 now 130-150 and DBP 65-80 now in the 85-95 range. I feel the PVCs and DD are related although there doesn't seem much evidence to suggest this. I have decided to start Flecainide 100 mg BID for the PVCs (after Bystolic; Inderal LA; and Verapimil did nothing for PVCs). The EP started me on Lisinopril 5 mg daily and I can increase that to 10 daily if SBP > 140. My biggest question is what are the chances of the grade I DD progressing? My cardio says "not much" but I'm not for sure what to make of that. Neither him nor the EP seem very excited about it. I am from the standpoint my symptoms have all occured in the past 3 years and my BP in the past 6 months. I do have a high lipid profile for which I have changed my diet; don't smoke; red rice yeast 1200 mg daily; niacin 500 daily and will get a lipid profile and liver function tests in 6 weeks or so. Thats about it. I don't feel I need an ablation at this time it seems a bit drastic. What is your opinion of Flecainide; BP control and medications I should be on and the longterm prognosis if I can control my BP? This discussion is related to Arrhythmia and Diastolic Dysfunction of LV (E/A<1).,2010,2010,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I will not be seeing a neuro dr until May 8th and I feel as though I am losing it. I am on my 4th week of not feeling well. Numbness; tingling; joint aches; muscle weakness. I am tired but my the overwhelming fatigue has gone. By the time evening rolls around I have worked myself into a frenzy of crying; being sad and thinking that all I wish was I knew what was wrong with me and praying that I wake up tomorrow feeling normal. I have had a mri on the brain that showed multiple white lesion and with my symptons my regular dr is leaning toward MS. Would ms symptons come on this strong and last this long? before this episode I never really had any problems. I am scared that if this isn't ms what is it then.... I know that more then likely when I see the neuro he probably won't be able to tell me a whole lot. how do I overcome these depressing feelings? Also has anyone ever heard of being on a medication for a few years and then all of a sudden begin to have side effects from the drug? Reason I am asking is I have been taking lisinopril for high blood pressure for 2 years now. I found a site about side effects of medications and when I looked at lisinopril there were many people on there writing about side effects that they are having being on that drug and their symptons are alot like the ones I am having right now with the tingling and so on. Am I grasping at straws thinking it could be my meds? Any thoughts would be appreciated.,2009,2009,52,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,For 6 months; I've felt miserable. It began; however; late last year with scintillating scotoma; arm weakness and tingling; tunnel vision; and a feeling that I was going to faint. These episodes would last 20-30 minutes. I was episode-free for awhile; then began to feel terrible with flu-like symptoms 6 months ago. An urgent care nurse practitioner diagnosed me with sinusitis and administered a corticosterioid injection with a round of Clarithromycin antibiotics. For a few days; I felt wonderful and on top of the world. Four days later; I had another episode of wanting to faint. I did not; yet it was everything I could do to steer away from the perceived reality that I was about to die. I literally feared for my life as I counted 1-100 simply to keep my focus. Things went progressively downhill after that episode. I went to the ER that evening with a blood pressure of 150s/115; pulse 125-150. The ER doctor administered a 100mg prescription for Metoprolol. Prior to that; I was only on .88mcgs of Levothyroxine for Hashimoto's Disease; along with 1000mg of concentrated Garlic extract. I had never had excessive hypertension; with an average blood pressure reading of 130s/70s. (Side Note: One year prior; I was having significant heart palpitations; which were checked by a cardiologist via ECG; 24-Hour Holter; Stress Test; etc. The results came back inconclusive for any damage or anything to worry about; other than PVCs and a need for weight loss/exercise.) After being on such a high dose of Metoprolol; within 2 weeks my blood pressure was still higher than before the meds (around 140/90) and the side effects were terrible. They included: dizziness; light-headedness; excessive fear; severe anxiety-like symptoms; feeling of doom; excessive tiredness; weakness; severe muscle twitching; leg swelling; stabbing pains under ribs; headache...and again; I cannot overemphasize the feelings of anxiety; which I interpreted as heart attack or stroke symptoms. They were mind numbing. I was afraid to drive; afraid to stay away from home; afraid to be in public; for fear of something like my own death occurring. To this day; those symptoms exist; to a lesser degree. After about a month on Metoprolol; I found a primary care provider (previously I did not have one); but was only ever given an appointment with a practitioner. Having been in practice only 3 months; they removed me from Metorpolol because of symptoms and a sluggish heartbeat; along with the fact it wasn't doing much for my pressure. It was replaced with Lisinopril; and I was told to followup in 3 months...3 months! I knew I couldn't wait that long. Almost immediately; I switched primary care providers hoping to see a physician. Again; I was assigned a nurse practitioner who lowered the Lisinopril dosage to 2.5mgs and told me I could not be having the symptoms I described; that "it's in your mind." Symptoms from the Lisinopril continued; the dizziness became more severe; and the severe "spurts" of anxiousness continued. It would feel like an adrenaline rush from the back of my neck; upward to my head; like hot water rushing over me; then I would want to run; literally; because I was worried about passing out or feared death. It was pure fear. Finally; I obtained doctor's permission to discontinue the high blood pressure meds altogether. Within a week; I could time the feelings of anxiety; which began to decrease more and more. The dizziness and most other symptoms subsided; except muscle twitching. For 2 months; I've been without medication; other than Levothyroxine and Garlic. My blood pressure maintains itself at either excellent or prehypertension levels; dependent on work stresses; activity; etc. My current problem is that I still feel sluggish; sometimes slightly anxious to a lesser degree (which I never did before all of this); and now there are continued muscle and neck pains; sometimes to the point of "am I having a heart attack." I have also developed something akin to GERD. Not a lot of acid reflux; but stomach pain that can be severe. My thyroid levels; MRIs; pituitary MRI; adrenal levels; chest x-rays; WBC; RBC; ANA; RA Factor; all came back normal. The only thing is; during this period of time; my Sed Rate and CRP levels raised from normal to very high (29 and 13.2 respectively). However; my practitioner; my endocrinologist; and a rheumatologist each say those two results are very "non-specific." No further tests have been ordered. Where could all this be coming from? Anxiety? Personally; I don't believe so. Stomach issues? Possibly. Cardiac issues; despite normal testing? Very possibly; I believe; especially since I've been pill free for all this time and still have PVCs that will make me dizzy or cough. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.,2016,2016,,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 63 yr old male; and started hypertension about a decade ago. Took Lisinopril; which knocked my systolic down from the 160s to the 140s for awhile. Recently; even with Lisinopril; was spiking close to 200. New Dr. added HCTZ (diuretic) which got it back under 150; but the 2 together make me ongoingly fatigued; and dizzy upon standing up. The new doc; nor anyone else; knows why I have such high BP. I'm underweight; not overweight; never drink or smoke; eat mostly grain; veggies and a little fish with low salt; hike in the hills regularly; semi-retired; low stress life with daily meditation; definitely don't fit the profile for hypertension. Go figure rolleyes Anyway; I've recently read about studies that show a few disconcerting conclusions about BP meds; such as: - they frequently don't work; even with 3 combined meds (ACE; Calcium Chain + diuretic) - they work for awhile but then stop; and reconfiguring meds/doses doesn't help much - some studies have shown they actually increase; rather than decrease; rate of heart-attack/strokes in takers; as a side effect; even if the numbers seem to go down - other studies show the rate of heart attack/stroke in people who ran high numbers for any length of time; then successfully brought the numbers down with the meds; had just as many heart attacks/strokes as those who never brought their numbers down; indicating that once the vascular damage is done; even if meds successfully lower your numbers from that point on; it makes little difference to the damaged veins; heart and organs Obviously; if any of those points are accurate; the BP drug-makers don't want you to know; so some of these studies seem hard to locate; but I've seen 'em So I'm interested in the latest accurate info about these points; from people who really know. My cardio doc isn't one of them. He's a nice guy but he just writes me scrips for the pills and says that's the only fix. Please respond and help clarify; much thanks.,2014,2018,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 47 year old menopausal female. Prior to suffering CHF last July; I have not had health problems. To save a long and gruesome tale; the CHF left a left valve aortic insufficiency. The enlargement has now subsided and the EF went from 25% to 66% with the last MUGA. The follow on care of a regimen of high doses of lasix and spirolactone caused renal failure and I had emergency dialysis with no apparent permanent kidney damage. It is miraculous to have survived and the AI will eventually need to be addressed. Currently I am taking a low dose of Coreg and Lisinopril; BP is fine and generally I feel better than I probably should; all things considered. I attribute the initial CHF to my own ignoring of hypertension; my heavy smoking and a lifetime of diet pills. The renal failure was simply a medical mistake. Now I have stopped smoking (from 2 packs a day); am limiting my salt; liquid and alcohol intake and can walk for 15 minutes without chest pain. I have porked out 20 lbs and am miserable. Without nicotine; or even a lot of water to stay full; I have a monstrous appetite. I just don't know how to address it. Certainly I am limiting sugar and processed carbs; but the weight is sticking. I would sure appreciate suggestions for getting the weight off given my limitations. Thanks in advance.,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 38 year old male; 5'10 220 lbs non- smoker. Father (age 77 - had a stroke at age 72- still alive) and mother (age 63 High BP) still living and otherwise healthy. I have two have brothers ages 49 & 45; we have the same father but different mother. Both have had heart attacks and quad bypass surgeries in recent years. They were both smokers and drug & alchohol abusers. In November 2005 I had an episode in which I became dizzy; had shortness of breath and my heart began to race. I also felt chest discomfort. My wife drove me to the emergency room. After a BP check 159 / 95; EKG (normal) and some other tests such as CT Scan ;blood work; ext(all normal) the doctor recommended that I stay overite and get an echo cardiogram. I agreed to stay. I followed up with my doctor who gave me the results of the echo: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and he prescribed 10 mg Lisinopril which I have been taking daily since. About 5 years ago I had a similar episode and my doctor back then had me perform a Stress Test which came back normal. They also did a chest x ray and said that my heart was slightly enlarged but did not prescribe any meds. I often feel tired and I experience episodes of shortness of breath. The left side of my chest feels heavy and there is almost always some pressure their. I have weekly headaches; heart palpitations and even some pain in my chest. These symptoms by the way precluded my trip to the emergency room for about 5 months. I have had two episodes of pain over the last three months that I spoke to my doctor about. My doctor took and EKG after both which was normal. About a week ago he had me wear a Halter Monitor over nite which picked an episode of 125 bpm while I was driving and he said that my heart rate is pretty high for a guy my age. Usually around 85 bmp when I go for a check-up. Last week my doctor decided to prescribe me 25 mg of Metoprolol. He said that it was a small dose that might help slow my heart rate down. I have not started taking this yet as I have had anxiety about taking another pill. Over the last few months I think that I have become depressed. I have three young children and I am worried of what might happen to them and my wife should something happen to me. I have not discussed my deppression and anxiety with my doctor. My wife is upset with me b/c of not talking my depression over with my doctor. I believe that I have two separate issues: LVH and now Depression / Anxiety. I would appreciate any comments / advise on different treatments for LVH and specifically what meds seem to work the best? Also; what are the survival rates of folks associated that hav LVH? And any other advise would be appreciated. What else can I do to help my self feel better? Like treating the depression? Med suggestions? Thank you very much for your help. Rich,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello. I am 44 year old obese man with diabetes and hypertension; both currently well controlled by medication. In the past several days I have noticed a large; irregular swelling on the inside of my scrotum; front side. It is painless. When held in my hand it's about he size of a small chicken's egg; although not well defined in shape. Consistency is about that of firm clay. Palpitating it does not cause any discomfort. Testicles seem to be normal size and regular shape. Urination and ejaculation are normal. Medications: Glucovance; Actos; Toprol XL; Lisinopril; Lasix w/pot. chloride; Paxil. Is this something which requires examination? My regular physician is an internist; should I seek a urologist's examination? Thank you for any attention to this.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Since beginning the new year on January 1; I have lost 19 lbs (today is January 16); going from 267 lbs to 248 lbs (I am 6'2" tall). I also have a rapid onset of stomach fullness when eating even relatively small amounts of food; and frequent; liquid diarrhea. Truth be told I don't have much appetite; and I am recovering from a bout of flu that lasted from 1/4 until about 1/11 (cough/cold; sinus pain/pressure; and generalized malaise/body aches). Concurretn with the flu; I also had an outbreak of oral herpes; for the which I took Valtrex; 2 gm Q12H x 1 day (4 gm total) and used a Zovirax ointment on the cold sores. This past week I tried to eat lots of high-fat; and fattening foods (pizza; doughnuts; burgers; rotisserie chicken) to see if I could abate or even reverse some of the weight loss; but I could not - in fact; I lost an additional two pounds. My mouth "feels funny" - dry and tingly; for lack of better descriptors; and I get really sleepy after eating. I drink only about 15 oz of coffee each day; in the morning. I eat pretty much everything; but have recently tried to limit my beef intake out of concern for BSE/vCJD. I am a 40 year old caucasian man. I take the following medications: Zoloft 200 mg/day (depression); Lisinopril 20 mg/day (hypertension); Singulair 20 Mg/day (extrinsic asthma); Clonazepam 0.5 mg BID (anxiety); Valtrex 1 gm PRN (oral herpes); Ambien 10 mg HS (insomnia); Tylenol #4 PRN for headache pain (taken infrequently). During my flu and herpes outbreak; I took 400 mg Ibuprofen QID for achiness and fever; which I have now been able to discontinue. I also take Claritin-D as needed for seasonal rhinitis. Ive been taking all these meds in these amounts for at least a year - none of them are new to me. Needless to say I'm afraid to go to my doctor - sounds foolish; I know - but I'm very concerned that this might be cancer; or diabetes; or something worse. I am my family's sole support - I have a small son and a stay-at-home spouse; and the thought of a serious illness scares me. The weight loss is really the scariest thing to me - I know at 6'2" and 267 I needed to lose weight; but I'd been roughly that weight for more than a few years; and I'm a terrible dieter - I cheat constantly. I'd love feedback as to what this might or might not be. Sould it be Hepatitis? A yeast infection of some kind? Other possibilities? Parasite? Something...worse? Lastly I just had to change insurance from an open plan to a HMO - and this is just the sort of thing that scares me about HMO care - I don't want some doctor just shoving Immodium at me and waving me off - it seems like this might be serious. How do I bring appropriate gravitas to bear on the medical equation in an HMO environment? Thanks - peace and love to all of you; and I welcome your feedback.,2004,2004,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was hoping you could answer a question I have about the location of fasciculations. I had a few thigh fascics about a week ago that lasted for three days on and off. They seem to have gotten better. Prior to that I had a week of Bilateral hand cramping which has also pretty much resolved. I've had fascics before and wasn't to worried until I came across something on ALS that said thigh fascics were characteristic which set me on edge. I saw a neurologist who specializes in Movement DO and he assured me that benign fascics can occur anywhere and he was not aware of any special association with the thigh in ALS. I have no associated weakness or atrophy. The hand cramping worries me because i don't know what caused it. What is the cause of cramping in ALS.,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Howdy. Glad I found this site. Description: 41 yr old male. Non-smoker; controlled hypertension; about 40 lbs overweight; large frame man; 6'3" 275 lbs. I started having a-fib 4 yrs ago; age 37. Did all the test and heart seems normal except a slightly enlarged atrium; maybe due to undiagnosed HBP on my part. Went thru all the meds with no help. Had my first ablation in Austin in Jan. 2002. Went back into a-fib within 2 weeks. Doctor said give it 3 months. Same pattern developed where it would stay in for a week or two and then return to sinus for a week or two. Finally in May of 2003 I went into a-fib 24/7 and been in since. The EP says another ablation has about a 50/50 chance of working. Questions. 1). Should I try another ablation first? 2). With the failed ablation and the enlarged atrium should I just go ahead and put in the pacemaker. The EP says it has the best chance of controlling my life. 3). Does everybody experience consant dizziness and lightheadedness? Is this a symptom of the A-fib or the meds. I am currently on Diltiazm. Lisinopril; Atenolol. Thanks in advance for your help and it's good to see a sight where you can talk to other people and MDs at the same time. Greg P.,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,History: 36 y/o male with hypertension BP 150/110 My internist perscribed 50mg Atenolol 4 weeks ago. After 1 dose; my HR dropped to about 40-45. The dosage was reduced to 12.5 mg and since my BP has been normal (120/70). However; I still have periods of low HR (40-45). I am a runnner (although not much in the past 10 months); but do not know what my resting HR was prior to starting Atenolol. The side effect in the first few days were fatigue; etc. However; in the past week or so; I've had ringing in my ears and a "jittery" feeling that seems to be getting worse. This prevents me from sleeping at times and when I am able to sleep; wake up during the night with these feelings. I take the medication just before I go to sleep. My doctor thinks these symptoms could be caused by anxiety and has perscribed Lexapro. He has suggested I take this for a week and then switch my BP medicine to Lisinopril due to the Bradycardia. My question is: could the ringing and "jittery" sensation be caused from the Bradycardia as opposed anxiety or a side-effect of the Atenolol?,2004,2004,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,Original post was 2/17/05 "single a-fib and sinus tach".35yr m.BP was 160/120.1a-fib;sinus tach(from 30 day holtor 130 hr);24hr monitor min 60 max 130 w/ 2 atrial runs;24 hr urine for pheo norm; stress echo norm prior to medication change.Thank you for your initial response.This has been quite an ordeal.Since initial post;things have improved.Now it appears as if sudden BP increase was catalyst all along.No more a-fib; and limitied sinus tach.Cardio removed Toprol from regimin due to how bad it made me feel.After some trial and error I am now taking Cardizem LA 240mg; aspirin 325mg; and Lisinopril/HCTZ 20-12.5.BP now averages 116/64 and have been as low as 102/56.Also the Cardizem does not make me feel near as bad as the Toprol.Still a little anxiety as now it seems wierd to feel somewhat normal. Questions-1.What could cause the sudden BP spikes attributing to the events described when all cardio evals are normal with no other major changes?2.Can BP really have that wide of an effect on overall health?3.With BP control could I anticipate this to now be in the past?4.Please elabotrate on the stress of BP med changes and each persons individual response to a importance of sticking with it to find the right one for each person.I was very frustrated by this but glad now I stuck with it5.Is it odd that the Toprol didn't affect me positively; but the CCB did?6.With BP much lower now I understand the lower the better with no adverse symptoms.How low is too low or is there such a thing without symptoms such as diizyness etc? Thank you very much!!!!!This is a great service!!!!,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,1.Have you ever heard of anyone getting Bradycardia and PVC's from blood pressure medicine? I was taking Calan 180 and started having a slow heart rate; extreme weakness; shortness of breath; and multiple PVC's which. After having a heart CT scan and echocardiagram (no problems noted on either other than bradycardia and pvc's) I stopped taking the Calan and symptoms improved dramatically. Since then have tried Hyzaar; Lisinopril; and Maxzide with the same reaction to each medication. Heart rate drops into high 30 and low 40's. Shortness of breath actually is worse when HR is in normal (70-80) range. I had been taking Calan for over 10 yrs with no problems. Heart rate; PVC's; shortness of breath much improved without meds but BP goes up. 2.I think the meds may be exacerbating symptoms from some endocrine condition which is affecting my heart rate(hypothyroid maybe; I have a lot of the symptoms but TSH was 1.8- dr is testing T-4 and cortisol; Glucose/insulin problem; fasting glucose 102 and I have had non-diabetic hypoglycemic for years. Symptoms worsen after eating but could be just because my heart is working harder due to digestion. 3. Could this be an autoimmune problem affecting my heart. Have had some weird pain lately such as sprained ankle pain (could barely walk and had no injury) and hip pain (inflammatory type not nerve or muscle) that went away after taking ibuprofen and has not come back. BP also goes down if I take ibuprofen. 4.What's your opinion and do you have any ideals as to what is going on with me and/or where we should look next. Thank you,2006,2006,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,My 15 year old; 5'11'; 115lb.; daughter has a bicuspid aortic valve with mild regurgitation and an ascending aortic dilation of 4.1 cm. She takes 3.75mg of enalapril daily to lower her blood pressure. She is on her high schools cross counrty; basketball; and softball teams. After a series of tests; her cardiologist advised her to stop participating in all of these activities. Do you agree that this is necessary? My daughter is devastated! Would corrective surgery allow her to possibly participate in these sports? Thank you so much for your help.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I went snowboarding in MT last weekend and smoked a half pack of cigarettes Friday night and close to a whole pack on Saturday night. I usually only smoke very occasionally (4 or 5 cigarettes in a month; if even). On the train ride home on Sunday; I felt like I couldn't breath and I was sure that I was going to die. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was really short of breath; I was totally clausterphobic and felt like I just couldn't get enough O2. I had to really concentrate on breathing too as if my diaphragm wasn't going to do it for me. I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would quit breathing in my sleep. Chest is also tight. It is almost a week later now and things have gotten better but I am still having touble breathing today. I also keep having to yawn; but can harldly ever reach that deepest part of a yawn where you feel like you accomplished something. All week long; I have also been having a strange sensation that I am going to choke when I put food in my mouth. I can only eat very small amounts of food at a time and wash it down with a lot of water. I'm sure all of this is related to the smoking last weekend at a high altitude. I am nervous that it is taking so long to resolve. I'm 27; 175lbs. and in otherwise good health. Chest x-ray; EKG; max air flow done Tues. - everything was normal. The doctor prescribed albuterol but that doesn't seem to help at all...only makes me shaky. I was taking lisinopril 5mg for hypertension but the doc uped to 10mg. Diasolic now around 50-60. Did I do permanent damage? Should I see a Pulmonologist?,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 45 year old male in very good physical condition; and a history of good health. However; I was hospitalized and had a battery of tests ~ 18 months ago due to very severe cold/flu symptoms (chest x-ray's; chest CT's; chest MRI; abdominal CT; echocardiogram; stress test (bruce protocal); pulmonary function tests; colonoscopy; battery of blood tests; and urine tests). Fortunately; nothing material found; mild/rare diverticulosis and small (~1 cm) cyst in AP window that pulmonologist is watching with annual CT. He believes the cyst is congenital. I have had a chronic cough for years; although never a smoker. I was also hospitalized with croup as a toddler. My doctor noticed mild hypertension ~ 2 years ago; and I have major white coat syndrome. My doctor put me on Lisinopril; but it greatly aggravated my cough. He has switched me to Benicar. The cough is better; but still present. About a week ago I began to hear an intermitant gurgling sound on my left side. I went to my doctor; and he listened; but couldn't hear it. He noted that my lungs were "as clear as can be". Any idea to what the sound might be attributable?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,45 male; non-smoker. Workout regularly. On treadmill this morning....within 2 minutes of running couldn't get my breath. Slowed run to a fast walk. No stamina; and started feeling this "vibration" in my lungs. Kept going on the treadmill (run...then walk for awhile...try to run some more...fall back to walk). After 20 minutes had to stop; loud "rumble" coming from my chest (lungs). Couldn't get a descent breath. Dizzy. Finally went home. Lots of flem (not normal during workout) which had an orange (light red?) color to it. After workout over; the mysterious lung condition abated after about 2 hours. This "attack" happened once last year...I explained to my MD- who heard symptoms of "dizzy" and "no stamina". Ened up doing the whole nuclear heart stress test- clean bill of health (on the heart issue). Would LOVE to hear some possibilities to research. Don't think I want to go to doc; now I'm fine. On 20mg Lisinopril for 1 yr; but on other hypertension meds since age 30.,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I recently had a CMP+LP+TSH+6AC+CBC/D/Plt done my ALT was High @ 53 (anything over 40 being high) My GGT High @263 (w/anything over 60 being high) My Cholesterol Total high @229(w/ anythign over 199 being high) My Triglycerides high @152 (w/ anything over 149 being high) My LDL Cholesterol Calc high @129 (w/ anything being over 99) I know I am about 30lbs over weight; but I do have an exercise routine & watch what I intake;slowly losing the rest of my weight. I take Lisinopril 30mg q daily; have taken Aciphex or Prilisec q daily (for numerous years) & I take supplements. I do consume alcohol daily usually red wines 2 to 4 glasses. I am 38 years old & I'm wondering besides cutting back on the obvious "Alcohol" what else could I "beef;" up or down on? I know my hypertension is a result hugely rlated to my weight gain & lack of exercise & (of coarse; Alcohol abuse). Are there supplements I can start taking to help improve my liver tests? Could the Prilisec/Acidphex be a huge contributor? Any imput is appreciated; I'm to young to have these kinds of results. This discussion is related to Elevated liver enzymes.,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 68 old female who is scheduled for a hysterectomy and prolaspes. Carotid study and echo were done.I have had about 7 of each the last being done two yars ago. My carotid always camw back as 16-49% blockage; this one came back as 0-16% blockage; very miniamal plague formation. My Echo has me really rightened. None of these things showed up two years ago; j just some emild regurg. This report shows cardiac chamber assessment to be in normal size and function. THE HEMODYYNAMICS SHOWS. Arotic scerosis without stenosis Miral annular calicaficatons;trace regurg Mild to moderate tricuspid regurg pulmonic valve normal without significant stenosis or regurg Moderate pulmonary hypertension. I am sure of the values you would want to know but I know the PASP is 51.2. my ejection fraction is 50>. I am seeing a cardio next week. Of course I did a net search and have myself scred out of my mind. What tests do you think will follow? I do take 5 mgs. lisinopril for mildly high b/p.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question. I am a 46 yr old male. What do you know about drug induced nipple/areola pain? This pain of mine began approximately 2 months ago and I cannot link it to any change in my life routine. The pain is felt when pressure is applied to the area and is beneath the surface. When bumped the pain can be quite sharp. My medical history includes treatment for hypertension; hyperlipidemia; chronic pain assosciated with sports injuries requiring multiple back (3); neck (1) and knee (3) surgeries; depression; sleep apnea. Meds are Lisinopril/hctz; Simvastatin; Cymbalta; Venlafaxine (yes a ssri and ssri/ne antidepressant together); Oxycodone and Tizanidine (used for sleep at 12mg -16mg hs). I too work in the medical field as a pharmacist of > 20 yrs. This has been worrying me and this site is the start of my research as to what is going on. I have no family history of breast cancer. My father at 86passed away after 5 different types of cancer. None were from metastasization. His cancer history started with prostate; thyroid; bladder; lung and bone in succession. He was a smoker until his mid 50's. Time to lick; stick and pour as they say. I will appreciate any information you have on this issue. This; I know; necessitates a visit to my own md for exam etc. In reading some of your other related messages I came across psycotropics; and prolactin and have yet had time to research. Thanks again.,2008,2008,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,After 40 years of running; an MI and quad bypass in 2006 came as quite a surprise. Didn't take me long to get back in my running shoes however - now back to 35 - 40miles per week. BUT; increasingly I am experiencing alarming and rapid increase in HR when i start to push the pace. Even though I ease back when my HR reaches 110 and walk; it can still escalate to 135 - 180. It does come down gradually but anything other than slow walking triggers it again. Bit like when a runner 'hits the wall' I am convinced that Beta Blockers are containdicated to my lifestyle and causing my problem (BB's reducing my hearts output and running pushing it up). Anyone else any experience conflict with Beta Blockers and endurance sports??,2008,2009,67,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,My son is 18; has gained approximately 60lbs in two years; prehypertension for just over a year. A couple of weeks ago is blood pressure shot up to 207/127 and stayed that high for over any hour before going to the ER. The first ER did nothing for an hour than retriaged him and his blood pressure was 195/111. At that time they said they still had several flu cases before him. We left and went to a different ER which took him back right away. His blood pressure went down on its own. They ran CBC; metabolic panel and chest xray. The blook test showed his lymphocytes were slightly elevated and his blood glucose was slightly elevated. His chest xray showed his lungs were hypoinflated. His blood pressure had been running around 140/80 before this episode. Two doctors don't seem to be worried. Am I being overprotective or should I be concerned something is going on? I really don't believe he is using drugs or alcohol.,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Dear Doctors/medhelp members; I really need some answers please... First of all; I had my second baby; 3 months ago. For almost 2 months; I have had some creepy symptoms going on. First; I started getting headaches in the morning; late afternoon. As soon as these arrived; I had mild dizziness; which has been continuous for 2 months. I am in my mid 30's; too. As a child; and now; I am overweight; but I have lost 20 pounds (the weight of this pregnancy). Well; ok; this is what is going on now... I am having shortness of breath; dizziness; (usually when getting things) tilting my head. My gp originally thought it was sinusitis; which did seem likely; as this weird stuff began around allergy season. Also; when I was in the hospital; I had a stretching feeling when breathing- I asked the nurses who checked me with a stethoscope and didn't think anything was going on. They also did an EKG in the hospital; which was fine. I continued to have these symptoms and was taking Labetalol for pregnancy-at home by bp was low; but it seemed extremely high at the dr. I think my cuff may have been off anyway. Well; I continued to feel strange with headaches and dizzy spells; so I went to a Neuro dr; who performed a CT of the brain; EEG; and x-ray of lumbar spine. Everything came back ok; but the x-ray showed degenerative disesase; but the dr didn't think it would cause all of these issues; so he ordered a cartoid artery test-still waiting on that. When I had the test; my heart skipped several beats and the dr noticed this. I have had this happen before due to nerves; the reason why I had to take Labetalol beta blocker in the first place; but my new dr never heard the skipped beats; just assumed I needed this med. Well; I talked to my gp about my condition; and said I was thinking it might be Labetalol; as I was doing great on Lisinopril last year. She said to get off this and start taking Enalapril 10mg; instead of labetalol 100mg 2x a day. And also; this week at the dr; my pulse was 68; which she said was much lower than normal for me; and thought it was the bp issues. I have only been on enalapril for a couple of days now; but have been very short of breath. I did tell her that I was having this before taking the med this week. She said the lower pulse might cause that. I just don't understand how it would be fine during pregnancy on labetalol; but then postpartum it wouldn't? It is confusing. I hate to keep asking; diagnosing myself and so forth; but I am feeling awful. I feel like I am going to pass out alot. I wonder if it is a lung/heart issue doing this? Should I give this med a few more weeks; would I really feel this short of breath from a med I had been on for 9 months; now? The lung feeling that is starting feels like something is down low; when I breath in like a blockage; or lump in my throat at times. And; then I get dizzy when bending to get things; or talking to people; getting excited. I wish I could have some idea what is going on. Thanks.,2007,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My cardiologist has prescribed an increasing dosing regimen of colestipol granules to help lower my LDL level. Here are my last two most current labs from before I started the colestipol. I eat a lower fat diet; exercise by walking 40 minutes 5-6 times per week; don't smoke; control borderline hypertension with 5mg lisinopril daily; have a BMI of 30 but don't have enough self control to lose any weight. I had muscle pain and memory loss with statins; flushing and finally facial swelling with niacin supplements. The memory loss was so bad; I sold my veterinary practice and retired BEFORE the lawsuit. I ran for exercise until I wore out my left knee; now I walk. Again; these labs are before any medication. 4/29/09 9/10/09 174 157 Total LDL Ch Direct 29 36 Total HDL Ch Direct (HDL2+HDL3 *good Ch) 248 241 Sum Total Cholesterol (Total amt circulating) 258 239 Triglycerides Direct (Increased assoc with CVD) B Real LDL Size Pattern (A-Ideal;A/B-moderate; B-High) Sub-Class Information 4 HDL-2 (most protective) 25 HDL-3 (least protective) I'm now on 10mg colestipol granules twice daily in the 500gm bottle of powder and 54mg fenofibrate once daily. I have two questions. I've read that colestipol may lower LDL 20% at 15gm twice daily. I'll have my blood rechecked after I've been on 30gm/d for about a 6 weeks. Is the cost (about $300/month) worth the benefit of hopefully lowering my LDL 20%? I've asked my cardiologist that question twice and not received an answer. It is a lot of money and our health insurance doesn't cover prescriptions. Second; I've tried mixing it with oatmeal; yogurt; milk; soup; tea; you name it. It's like eating sand! Since it's mostly silicate which IS sand; that isn't much of a surprize; but I don't like it. The pills were easier but cost about $1;125/month. Can you help me?,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you for taking my question - Male; 39; parasoxymal a-fib & labile hypertension; overweight (6'5"; 300#). It is believed by PCP & cardiologist that my high BP is most likely the catalyst for the a-fib (approx 1 episode lasting 2-45 minutes per 3-6 moths). Always spontaneously converts. Yesterday; BP reached 180/90 for no apparent reason. EKG taken by cardiologist as precation was normal. Cardiologist is having me drop Cardizem LA (180 mg) for Carvedilol (6.25mg 2x per day). Any reason to think this change could trigger arythmia or something else really kooky? I am told this is an excellent medication and typically very well tolerated. I tried Toprol XL before for several months. Did not tolerate it well; mainly due to severe nightmares. Once removed from the Toprol; nightmares stopped. Is this a different class of beta blocker that is safer and what (if anything) should I be concerned about? Meds are aspirin (81); protonix (40); HCTZ (25); Lisinopril (10-20) sertraline (50) and now the 6.25 carvedilol.,2006,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello Ladies and Gents; Is there anyone on this forum that has undergone the treatment; interferon and pegasis; and are still free of the virus 5 and 10 years later? I would like to know the long term effects of this treatment and what are the percentages of it coming back. Thank you; Also....does anyone know how to raise platelets? What foods to eat? What to avoid? My hubby has been taking Super K (vitamin) for 4 months now and his platelets dropped from 70 to 61 in a recent blood test last week so it does not appear to increase the platelets for sure.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; all - I am currently on 2 mg. diazapam (valium) and 5 mg. celexa (half a 10 mg. pill). I just started the celexa about 3 weeks ago; and have been on an even lower dose (working up frm 1/4 to half to 3/4 to 2 mg last month - my own way - I was prescribed the 2 mg.). Prior to the valium; I was on Ativan for about 2 months. My understanding from my psychiatrist is that the 'plan' is up the celexa (although I don't know how far - I have dysthymia and ocd; so I hear...) and at some point come off the valium. I also have hypertension; so take atenolol and lisinopril and a baby asprin each day. I'm 59 years old. Anyway; I see my primary care doc once a month - he is a cool old-school guy; who used to see me primarily for 'reassurance' for various anxiety / ocd issues until he decided I needed a psychiatrist to give me meds. He sent me to a colleague; who has me on these meds. Those close to me - my husband; therapist and a friend who is a former RN and who herself takes lexapro; all say I am doing 'much better' than I was. When I started posting here; I could barely eat solid food - mashed potatoes were difficult. Now; I have made some real improvement (hamburger; cut up; soft veg; and so on); although I'm not yet where I need to be (can't eat chicken; and so on.). When I saw my primary care guy yesterday; I saw I'd gained 5 lbs. OMG! I want to blame the meds but the reality is as I can eat stuff; I grab all the things that are bad for me; like donuts; cakes; chips and mex food. In any event; 5 lbs in one month seems high. My BP was also up but the doc wasn't concerned so much. He thought I might ask the psych to 'cut back' on the valium; as I complain of being 'lazy' and 'tired.' I will have been on some sort of valium in any case since February; albeit at a low dose. He also suggested asking to cut back on the celexa - to 2 mg. Huh? My psych said I wouldn't feel anything on 5 mg. I do feel somewhat tired; but I really doubt she's going to go down to 2 mg. I think my primary care doc's focus was to get me to a point where I could eat again. The psych seems to be looking at things differently - telling me I might have to take meds for my ocd 'for the rest of my life.' I am just starting the process of trying to get ON SSRI's; not off them. Aside from some nausea and tiredness / apathy; no big deal on the side effects. But I am confused. Do I try to get OFF this stuff now? If I do; will I still be able to eat? Will folks think I'm 'better?' I'm inclined to think my success is from the meds; and that if I go off; it won't be long before I'm back to square 1. I don't want to be; but why would my primary care suggest I cut back on such low doses? I serously doubt my psych would consider lowering anything at this point; I"m almost afraid to ask. I hate to bring up that my primary care doc suggested it; as they are colleagues at the same clinic - and well; in a showdown; you know who gets thrown under the bus - and it aint either of them. One or the other will say I didn't understand or whatall; just to save face... at least that's how that stuff usuall works. Ok; any one have any ideas on what i can do here? How can I discuss this w/ my psych diplomatically? She's a bit of a diva; but she seems to be very smart and I like her. I like my primary care doc too; though; and that's the problem. They both seem to have divergent opinions. As I see my psych next week; I need input asap - thanks. Anna,2008,2011,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; my name is Marcie. My husband is the one with a GI problem and we have no diagnosis after numerous tests. His signs and symptoms are right and left lower quadrant abdominal constant pain. The pain gets worse at times and diminishes at times. He states his pain is stabbing and constant. Nothing really makes it feel better or worse; except lying in the fetal position. He also has about 6-15 bowel movements a day depending on how he feels. His stool has been loose and watery for about 7 weeks; but now is softer and formed; sometimes black in color and sometimes light brown. He constantly feels like he has to have a bowel movement and cannot go anywhere or function with his activities of daily living because of it. He has lost about 20 pounds within four weeks without trying. He also suffers from nausea; belching; and blood; fat; and mucus in stool; and abdominal cramping. Other symptoms at times is chest tightness; body aches; waking up in middle of the night to defecate; blurry vision; fevers that come and go (max. 102.0 degrees F); flushing to face; and difficulty breathing. He also feels weak and has had loss of appetite. He is depressed because he cannot function in life without a toilet nearby. His medical history includes Hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and HCTZ; chronic sinus infections; and 7 years ago (age 23) his left arm became paralyzed with no explanation by the doctors. He regained feeling and strength to his arm after a year of rehab. He is 30 years old now. We saw a family doctor who tested his stool for Ova and parasites and did blood work on him on October 20; 2010 with all results being reported normal. We were referred to a Gi doctor who performed a colonoscopy on Nov.12th; 2010 with a diagnosis of "nonspecific colitis." The doctor states "a possible carcinoid tumor was observed around the appendix and also stated the appendiceal orifice appeared somewhat unusual with wide mouth and mucosal changes." The doctor also stated; "Terminal ileum was slightly friable and mildly congested; throughout the colon; there appeared to be some nonspecific edema and congestion and mild erythema." Biopsies were taken from the colonoscopy. The microscopic description states the " the appendiceal orifice; the terminal ileum; and the right colon show an unusual amount of lymphoid tissue with no well defined germinal centers. The biopsy from the appendiceal orifice and terminal ileum were sent off for further immunohistochemical analysis to exclude a lymphoproliferative disorder; which came back benign; and suggestive of chrons disease. A small bowel series was performed on 12/03/2010 to rule out chrons disease and what a surprise; it came back normal. This doctor referred us to get a CT scan done of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV and oral contrast to check for carcinoid tumors; which was done 11/17/2010. The results of this exam stated only a mildly fatty liver with the impression of a "grossly stable abdomen." Furthermore; we were referred to the cancer center to rule out carcinoid tumor. He was tested for 5-HIAA in a 24 hr urine collection; cbc; cmp; chromogranin A panel; clostridrium in stool; gastrin level in blood; LDH; Ova and parasites in stool; Retic count; and serotonin blood level; as well as campylobacter; salmonella; shingella panel in stool samples. All of these are to rule out carcinoid tumors; and they all came back negative. We have a follow up appointment with this GI doctor and will see what is suggested next to rule out this rare disorder. We don't know what to do. We will probably get a second opinion; but really can't afford it. Our life is on hold because of his illness which; I’m afraid; is not going to be diagnosed. He has been on Asacol medication since November 8th and is not feeling any better. We are afraid this is not going to be diagnosed and may be a mystery diagnosis; which he cannot go on living this way. If you can suggest any other ideas; rare diagnosis; or anything at all; we would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much. ??????? -Frustrated husband and wife,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; my question is in regards to my husbands health. He has had extreme swelling of the feet and abdomen. The swelling in his feet are bad and it goes up to around his knee area. He say's it's painful and has trouble wearing his shoes. He is an alcoholic and has been for years. I've noticed other certain physical changes as well. His face seems quite swollen and a redish color; his eye's seem bloodshot or a mixture of blood with a yellow cast to them. I guess my question is could all this swelling be due to liver failure? He does see a doctor on a reg basis about once every 3 months to get blood pressure checked (which is high) and other things too as a standard procedure with high blood press. and cholestrol etc. She never seems to concerned about the swelling and just keeps having him take more lassiks (not sure sp) but on the other hand I don't believe he shows her his feet either. They look like baloons with little toes sticking out. Would seem more likely a liver problem or a kidney problem? Sorry for all the info but thought it would be helpful. I forgot to mention he is 55 yrs old; 5'9" and weighs 250lbs approx. Thank you....,2010,2011,48,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am writing to try to get some information on what might be happening to my partner who experiences significant mood swings/behavioral changes at times. He refuses to go to the doctor so I am wondering if someone here can help me. First some information on his background and condition: Caucasian Male 39 yrs old. 30 Lbs overweight Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tachycardia Former methamphetamine user (used for many years; but has been clean for 10+ yrs.) Binge drinker (1 or 2 times a week) Current medications: Lisinopril (Blood Pressure) Atenolol (Heart Rate) Valium (for anxiety) Insulin injections (Humulin R; N) Basically; his behavior can go from 'normal' (calm; not agitated; clear-headed; etc.) to what I am calling "Altered" in a matter of minutes. During these episodes his behavior will deteriorate where he will gradually start acting like he is intoxicated; even though he has not been drinking. It will begin with slight mood changes and speech changes (such as mild slurring; searching for the correct word; etc.). General mood will be happy and sometimes giddy; unless he becomes agitated by something; which tends to happen very easily. If he becomes agitated or angry then his mood will further decline to belligerent or even violent behavior. He will say hurtful things intentionally and become verbally abusive. This negative mood shift does not always happen. In either case; it seems the only way for him to return to 'normal' is to sleep for 6+ hours. It seems like mentally stressful situations may bring this on; although I have also seen it happen after heavy meals. His Diabetes is not well controlled; and he often has high blood sugar spikes. He also does not take his other medications exactly as prescribed; instead choosing to take them whenever he remembers. He often takes 2 Valium at once; 1 time a day instead of 1 every 12 hours. Sometimes he skips a day. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.,2011,2011,34,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,OK...so it's been almost 3 weeks on Toprol XL (25mg) and I CAN'T BREATH! I have asthma already and absolutely cannot breath; which I now find out can be a side effect of Toprol. I literally can't walk 50 feet without having to rest and heave and ho and huff and puff on an inhaler to breath. While the Toprol is pretty much controlling my blood pressure; it does not last the full 24 hours. After about 20 hours; my BP shoots up; my breathing gets even WORSE and I feel like hell until I take the pill and it kicks in. My doc has now put me on Cardia XT; starting tomorrow; and I'm curious if anyone has taken this drug; expecially if coming directly off another like Toprol. The side effect warnings are scaring me to death. Any comments??,2008,2008,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Last night I woke up around ten pm and ran down my stairs to get something to drink. When I ran back up and sat on my bed I strted to feel my heart beating irrelgular. It was probably for a total of about ten seconds (although it felt like an eternity). What my heart did was beat; then stop as if it skipped a beat; and then beat very fast for about 4 beats like bump; bump; bump; bump; it skipped a beat again; and then it went to normal beating and I listen to it for the next ten minutes and it seemed fine but now I'm scared. I take lisinopril and hydrochlorathiazide for my hypertension. Any ideas? Should I see my doctor? By the way; I had an EKG about 1 year ago that was fine.,2008,2009,32,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 56 years old with a family history of heart disease; hypertension and diabetes. I have had high blood pressure; semi controlled; for 10 years. I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond. The extent of coverage of the pain is only pinpoint area on my chest and forearm. They appear and disappear right at the same time. There is no accompanying tachycardia; shortness of breath; or palpitation. Neither is it associated with heavy physical exertion. Have you had patients with this kind of chest and arm pain? What do you recommend for me to do?,2010,2010,55,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Some history: My 74 year old mother who has been very healthy her whole life; was diagnosed as having high blood pressure (160's/90's) last year. Prior to this; she had never had any problems with hypertension. She has tried to control it with diet (low sodium) and has been moderately successful (BP varies: the last time she gave blood it was 125/80something; but was 160/85 at a recent doctors appointment). At that same dr's appointment; she was found to have low hemoglobin (10). Her doctor prescribed iron and had her do a stool sample (she has not received the results yet). My question: What relationship; if any; is there between high blood pressure and low hemoglobin?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi. I'm a 22 year old male and for the past 5 years or so I've had a pounding heart where I've always been able to feel my heart beating; specifically in my abdomen area. My stomach and shirt would always be visibly shaking with my pulse and when anxious it would pound even harder. The past month; however; it feels like my heart is beating a lot softer. Today; I often cannot feel my heartbeat and cannot see my pulse in my stomach except when I'm anxious. When I'm anxious; it still pounds (what feels like) extremely hard. I guess this is more normal to have an unnoticeable heartbeat so maybe I shouldn't even be worried but I'm not used to this at all and it's making me very worried because I don't know what could have caused this change. I haven't changed my diet or exercise and I'm more stressed than ever. My first guess is that my blood pressure may have dropped. A few years ago I went to see my doctor about my pounding heart and when he took my blood pressure it was very high (around 180 systolic). I then sat in a room for 5 minutes to calm down and the systolic number dropped to about 155. However; I don't think my blood pressure was normally that high and I just attribute it to anxiety or "white coat syndrome". I bought a blood pressure monitor about a month ago at the time when my heartbeat was starting to feel softer and I've been taking a lot of readings since and they have been pretty good (usually 110-130 systolic; 60-80 diastolic when sitting) but this is when I'm at home; completely calm. I don't know what my at-home blood pressure was when I had a pounding heart so I don't know if it even dropped. Also; I believe my resting heart rate has increased a bit over the past month (maybe around 10 bpm). Other possible causes I've come up with: weight gain (weight around stomach area causing me to not feel the pulse there anymore? I haven't really gained weight in the past month though); heart is contracting differently or failing or there is some blockage (afraid of this). So; are any of the causes I've listed above plausible? Should I be concerned about this change in heartbeat forcefulness and potential drop in blood pressure considering I haven't changed my lifestyle? Are you able to see / feel your heartbeat at all times? I've developed fairly severe hypochondria over my heart to the point where I'm constantly checking my pulse; losing sleep worrying and even having dreams about waking up with a heart attack... I just want to know if I should be concerned at all. I have an appointment next week but a week seems like so long. Thanks.,2014,2014,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with 55-60% ejection fraction in my left ventricle. I am taking 15 mg. Lisinopril and very little Bystolic about 1.5 mg. for my high blood pressure.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I apologize if this is in the wrong section. I was put on metoprolol about six years ago for hypertension and palpitations. I have been eating right and have lost some weight over the last year. I have been taking 100 mg at noon and 100 mg at midnight. For a while now my resting heart rate has been very slow anywhere from 39 bpm to the low to mid forties and I've felt like a zombie. I went to my doctor and he told me to reduce from 200 mg to 150 daily.(100 at noon 50 at midnight) A week later I was still having slow heart rate and he reduced from 150 to 100.(50 mg at noon 50 mg at midnight) 3 days later I went back because of slow heart rate and he cut it down to 25 mg at noon and 25 mg at midnight. I've read that it is dangerous going off of Metoprolol and was wondering if I should be worried.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi all--This seems like a great; supportive site. Back in December; I started getting terrible pains in my lower left abdomen. My dr thought it was diverticulitis; but sent me for a CT scan; which showed a small cyst on my left ovary (1.7 x 1.5 x 2.3); but not enough to cause me such pain. I am 42 years old; in very good general health (except high bp); never had a baby--and 12 years ago I was misdiagnosed with PCOS. Anyway; I went to my gyn (who is also an oncologist); and he was unimpressed and said come back in a month. yseterday was a month--they did an ultrasound which showed that the cyst has doubled in size and is 100% fluid-filled; simple. Might be a septum; or not. My gyn ordered a CA125; but wants to remove the cyst anyway if it doesn't clear up in a month. Also; I have been under HUGE amounts of stress; and somehow; when I'm not in my office; the pain disappears. My periods have been normal until last September; when I started getting them intermittently. My mother went through menopause at 42; so nobody was alarmed. My question: how likely is it that a fluid-filled cyst can be cancerous? And has it ever been shown that stress impacts cysts and/or cancer? Thanks so much for your help.,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 33 year old male...6'4" and 238 pounds. I have had 2 ablations for AVNRT SVT tachycardia last year; May and July at UPMC. No more SVT that I have noticed since second procedure. After the second procedure I developed a PE. I was on warfarin for 6 months and then in Jan 07 I went to a hemotologist and had many tests that were ok; so I stopped warfarin. At the same time; due to daily aspirin and severe anxiety from heart issues; I developed gastric and duodenal ulcers. I went on protonix and was fine in a few weeks. In October 06 I had more abdominal symptoms; had upper endo to reveal small ulcer. I took more protonix and was ok again. I was put on Klonopin for anxiety around that time as well. I also have PVCs; which I always have had a few here and there since I can remember; but they are much worse now...and have been much worse since the SVT appeared in Feb 06. I have bad pvc attacks and bigeminy; trigeminy at times (usually when I first wake up and a half hour after I eat until about two hours after I eat). I have had MRI for ARVD that was negative. I have had gastric emptying study which was normal; and a repeat endoscopy showed everything healed and a small hiatal hernia. Had ultrasound for gall bladder/pancreas which was unremarkable. Had HIDA scan that showed normal gall bladder emptying. I should also mention that I have had MRI/MRA for headaches I have been having and they revealed nothing remarkable. An Echocardiogram I had one year ago showed a a left ventricle end diastole measurement of 5.9 cm. I had another echo 6 months later that indicated the same measurement at 6.3 cm. Wall thickness measurements and atrium etc... all within normal size limits. My ejection fraction was 50% and 49% respectively. The MRI in August of last year showed a EF of 49%. For over a year I have not had caffeine; or alcohol; and I never have smoked. I started on Toprol (100mg) six months ago and also take an ACE (20mg) Here are my questions: PLEASE SEE NEXT SECTION BELOW:,2006,2007,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Im a 25 years old and for the most of my quarter of a century of life; i have been pretty normal. In February of this year i had eaten an extremely large meal and felt very light-headed afterwards. My symptoms were a racing heart and a feeling of fainting. I didnt know what was going on so i began to panic due to the fact that i had never felt that way before. I went into my car and locked the door and just lied down hoping it would go away which it did eventually. My dad was with me and he had said "son; u just ate too much" so the anxiety kinda went away; or did it...? For the next couple weeks i had returned to normal but in the back of my mind i thought "what really happened that day". I begen overdwelling on things afterwards such as arm pains ; headaches; ect ect..which eventually brought back the same feeling. I had told my parents about my feelings and my mother had told me to go to the supermarket and have your blood pressure taken at the pharmacy; so i did...I went in feeling very nervous and as the machine squeezed my arm i began to feel my heart race. My reading was 152/92 and i FREAKED OUT and had a full blown panic attack! I somehow drove myself to the hospital and they calmed me down; gave me an EKG which was normal except for the beats per minute obvoiusly and they were able to calm me down and once my blood pressure came back down to 130/80 they let me go and told me to try taking xanax. I went online and read the side-effects and decided that i shouldnt start taking medication at my age.I decided to visit a carteologist just to be safe. When i was there; i was extremely nervous and my "bp" was 140-100 . They really didnt say much about that probably due to the fact that they knew i was nervous; however my heart overall was fine. It is now june 2006 and have developed an enormous phobia about blood pressure and decided to purchase my own blood pressure monitor for my home(this made things worse) and everytime i apply the cuff i get nervous and it is always high. I decided to visit the hospital again and try and overcome the fear again so i could convince myself i didnt have high blood pressure. Once again i started to feel nervous and began to have another anxiety attack(arms tingling;heavy chest; ect ect) thus when they took it; it was high. They gave me a xanax pill and came back about 30 mins later and my blood pressure was 128/78. The following day i went back to the hospital again and took a xanax and it was 120/70.My blood pressure phobia is slowing deminishing; however my new worry is that "is my blood pressure only normal when i am on xanax" is xanax made to lower blood pressure and if someone that has hypertension took xanax; would their blood pressure come down too? I feel as though i am losing controle of my life and have a fear of developing "ocd".Do you think i have hypertension;or is this all in my mind? When i come home from the hospital i am ok for a few hours untill allthe "what if's"enter my brain!help!,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Want to tap into the collective experience of those who are on; or who have been on blood pressure medications. What have you tried? What dose?

Lisinopril+hypertension,I have worked very strenuous jobs most of my life I am 50 years old resting pulse rate is usually below 60 BPM but my blood preasure has been high for years. I worked out in the hot desert with excessively high BP thru 116 temp and high humidity due to unusual amount of rain. I know my BP was over 200/120 while I was booming and chaining heavy equipment. I did feel discomfort at times. I guess my question is people who lift heavy weights working out have their BP go off the charts when they do it...is it maybe not normal to have higher than usual BP much the same as body mass weight to height is a joke for anyone of my stature? (I am 5'9" 230 LBS pretty lean my bmi says for my height I should weigh 165). In a nutshell my theory is this: I work long and hard hours quite often for the last 30 years my resting heart rate is low is it unreasonable to think higher than average BP is not always bad? My bp right now is like 150/100 heart rate 57 bpm without meds. I take meds which has it down to 124/77 with 59 BPM. I was taking lotrel 5/20 which costs like $90 a month (Hence working in the desert with extreme high BP) Now I take Lisinoprell HCTZ 10-12.5 which is a $4 wal-mart med. The cost of the med is what made me go without BP med an unrelated trip I also couldn't afford to the ER is when I discovered the $4 perscription.,2012,2012,50,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with Non-Ischemic Cardio Myopathy; I am a normally healthy male 47 years old 5'-7' 180 pounds and; a Truck Driver. I have no blockages according to Cardio Cath Inspection yet that and; an Echo Cardiogram showed I had 10% LVEF 6 months ago. Meds to bring me up to 23% last month( 6 months later ) are as follows Lisinopril 20mg per day;Carvedilol 25mg per day; Spironalactone 25 mg per day; and Furosemide 40 mg per day. I must reach 40% LVEF by May or I loose my Job; I have 18 years of seniority at this company. My question is; what else can I do to speed up my healing process and reach and/or exceed this 40% LVEF requirment by; the Department of Transportation.,2011,2011,46,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have Liddle Syndrome;and it is a very rare kidney disease. Very few Doctors know about it. It is passed through families and can be deadly; as I found out a month ago. I would like to get Docs and people to know about this. Kidney Docs usually know but I found out that most MD's don't have a clue.The hospital where I was had to Google it to find out about what I was telling them and then they had to transfer me to a larger hospital to save my life.,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Is my next step a diagnosis and treatment center? Age 67. I have an inherited autoimmune system with serious diseases (RA; Chones; diabetes). My nephrologist says I have approximately 40% kidney function. My protein spill is over 9 grams daily. Cyclosporine did not bring it down. I am back on lisinopril 5mg daily and monitoring blood pressure closely. Also taking polycitra-K as I have crystals in urine. I am a candidate for bloodclots so drink plenty of water. These are other reasons for the question. My thyroid is very unstable; changing with each blood test. I have mild microscopic colitis with uncontrolled diarrhea (almost constant; but occasioncl normal bowel).I am anemic with no blood in urine nor feces. My heartbeat is irregular afternoons and evenings. I take Protonix 40mg daily for GERD; levsinex .375 twice daily and levsin sl .125mg as needed for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Lasix 40mg twice daily for edema (even though I add no salt nor salt substitute). Lipitor 10mg daily. I do not tolerate NSAIDS at all (kidneys react). I need to include osteoarthritis; fibromyalgia and costocondritis for which I take no medications. I am 5'8" and weigh 148 lbs. I have stayed in good physical condition and actually feel good. I've managed the pain with exercise and emotional stability. I would like to save what kidney function I have and get everything under control. What's next?,2004,2004,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 48 year old female in pretty good health. Last month I went home from work with what appeared as the flu. I felt achey and my stomach hurt. I had been feeling strange; kind of anxious for no reason. I went home to bed. I woke up around midnight with a horrible pain in my upper stomach. I had my galbladder out about 7 years ago but the pain i had was exactly the same pain; same area. It got so bad my husband took me to the emergency room. They ran blood tests and gave me a shot for the pain; which helped. The test came back with elevated SGOT and SGPT levels; they sent me home and told me to see my dr asap. I went the next day; he told me my levels in the hospital were 215 and 440; he took more blood tests and told me he was sure it was hepatitis. He sent the test out and in a week the test came back negative; but the levels went up alittle higher; 250 and 470. about a week later he took more tests and they also came back negative; but the levels had come down to 45 and 60. The dr doesn't know what happened. He told me to come back in a month to have another test. My family and friends are a little concerned as to why they would be so high. The dr said it could have been hepatitis; and that it was just to early to show up. I know hepatitis is contagious... Should I be concerned? I still don't feel "right" and I am very very tired still...I have never had any jaundice; which is strange. the only things that I have felt; is the initial attack and being very very tired. I have read about others having elevated enzymes but none as high as mine...I don't take medication; I do have a glass of wine most nights after work; but just one. Do you think I should be concerned? Thank You for your time.,2002,2002,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,A little over 4 years ago I sustained a lower back injury in a horse accident. I was bucked off and I landed on a hard dirt driveway mostly on my right buttock and somehow also cracked my helmet in half. I had rads taken which showed minor disc compression at L5-S-1; but was told was normal for my age (I'm 43 now). I was rx'd NSAIDS and rest. Since then; I have always had lumbar pain on the right side and continue to this day to take ibuprofen; 600 mg BID. I have several health problems; bipolar 2 disorder; obesity; hypertension; fibromyalgia; and chronic Lofgren's Syndrome (erythema nodosum and polyarthraligia on and off for the last 10+ yrs). I frequently complained of back pain to my primary care physician; and was advised to lose weight to aleviate pain and try to get off the advil. At least twice a year; I would get erythema nodosum; for which prednisone was rx'd. My occupation as a veterinary technician required quite a bit of physical strength and flexibility; but when I was put on disability a year ago; my back problems worsened significantly from lack of *working*. Finally; 8 mos ago; l was helping push a dresser into place and my back seized/froze. The next morning; lumbar rads were taken which showed DDD. I was unable to progress in physical therapy due to extreme pain; I literally cried! I was on the wait list for an MRI; so while waiting; I was sent to the rheumatology dept and began to treat my fibromyalgia again; this time with flexiril and elavil (and my ibuprofen). My MRI report said that disc L-5 S-1 was desiccated and also had moderate DDD and end plate degeneration. There is a vascular hemangioma in L-3. My HMO's pain clinic suggests epidural injections to treat my pain; and if that didn't work; a laminectomy would be the next option. I wanted to wait and try alternative tx; so I have been going weekly to a chiropractor for gentle adjustments and stretching; and also spinal massage weekly. The gal that does the massages said I probably had lot of adhesions; because it was very painful the 1st 3 or 4 spinal massages. She works on the lower right lumbar area a lot and said I must have torn muscles in the accident; all the muscles that connect trunk to hip appeared to be painfully atrophied. The paraspinal muscles also spasm if a knuckle is pressed into it or any of the deep muscles in the area. My rheumatologist advised me to tell my chiro to avoid trying to adjust L-5; S-1 as it is too painful; and about to start fusing. The rheumatologist suggested accupuncture for the lumbar pain and believes it beneficial for fibromyalgia patients. I have not tried accupuncture as of yet; wanting to give time to see if chiro and spinal massage was going to work. I have improved significantly as far as being able to MOVE; yet still suffer muscular pain only on the right side of my lower back. I realized I have probably reached maximum benefit from the chiro office; so I contacted my HMO patient representative to discuss finding out the source of the pain via the "Physical Medicine" dept. I was seen in the physical medicine dept. 2 1/2 weeks ago. The Dr performed movement tests to see my range of motion. She said I should have the epidural; and when I questioned her about my muscles hurting; she said my pain was discogenic. I know that muscles are innervated and that pain can radiate; but when I press those muscles while standing perfectly still; a painful rebound spasm happens instantly--so how can it be neural pain if I take my own finger and depress the muscle instead of say; bending or twisting to make the muscle move? I explained the pain exactly like that and the Dr said she'd be right back. She came back after reading my MRI report and radiology report; again said that my pain was discogenic...she was smiling that polite "you are done; time to go". I thought it strange she had not even LOOKED at or TOUCHED my back; so I asked her to please examine and palpate the muscles so she can see for herself and put it in my chart. She did; and our 10 minutes were up. Anyway; as you probably can tell by now; I mistrust the HMO for ignoring my complaints of chronic back pain for 3 1/2 years; until it was too late; there is no way to un-dessicate my disc (lol) and I feel that simply injecting steroids into my epidural space will not address the muscles that hurt. Because my chronic Lofgren's Syndrome (a varient of sarcoidosis) I am leery of doing epidurals--what if my body overreacts to the intrusion of a needle into the space; and scar tissue forms around the puncture? I hear all the time how people are worse off after doing invasive things to already damaged spines. I bought a TENS unit and use it frequently on the massage setting and find it really complements the chiro and spinal massages--This is why I believe the majority of my pain to be muscular in origin. The tens unit enabled me to feel ok enough to attempt something I hadn't done in a year--I rode my horse (not the one that bucked me off 4 yrs ago!) I am delighted that I experienced no additional pain. Currently; meds I take are: Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) 150 mg bid Depakote (valproic acid) 500 mg Cyclobenzaprine HCL (flexiril) 10 mg bid Lisinopril/HCTZ 10-12.5 mg sid Amitriptyline (elavil) HCL 25 mg sid Ibuprofen 600 mg BID I welcome any insight or comments from others. I am thinking of going outside of my HMO to get another opinion. Sorry my post is so long and involved; but thought giving a full history best. Thanks.,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was "a little off" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested? Lots of questions. : ) Regards; Michelle,2001,2001,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello and thank you for your time. I am a 37 year old woman; 5'6" 258lbs. My main complaint is palpitations which have taken me to the ER more than once. My BP is generally 122-139 over 89-103; most recently 122/98.In the last 9 months I have had 2 episodes of SVT; this finally got me to a cardio who did a an echo and treadmill test;48 hr holter; and EKG. The echo was normal except for mild mitral regurg; and pac's/pvcs. The treadmill was also good except for my heart rate rose too quickly; obviously due to being obese. My EKG showed inverted p-waves. The holter showed I was having about 1-2% of total heart beats being PAC's. My cardio explained that I have what is called a junctional heart rythm; that my heart has created an extra pathway which he says is causing the PAC's. He talked to an EP ; who said he would consult with me if I wanted to but it was up to me. My cardio put me on ToprolXL 25mg.for pac's but it doesnt seem to be helping the diastolic reading ;still cant get it below 89; though the systolic goes down at times to 115 and pulse 52. Also the PAC's seem worse. Im wondering and worried as to why there is such a discrepency between the diastolic and systolic numbers. I did have a Kenalog (steroid) shot recently due to walking pneumonia. I have dropped 20lbs and am using the treadmill 45 mins per day; every day. Im on a very low carb diet. Since I am losing weight and excersizing; Im wondering if Ill be able to go off the Toprol. Also do you think ablation should be considered with a junctional rythm? Any other thoughts? Thanks for your time!,2003,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with 4+ severve mitral regurgitation. One cardoiologist told me that since I have hypertension Blood pressure averages are 150/99. Once under control with medications the reguritation should lessen and I should not have to worry. I saw another cardiovascular surgeon and he told me even with the decrease in blood pressure I will still have some reguritation. Cardiac cath done EF% 50% 4+ regruitation. Aortic Pressure 132/93; left vent pressure 132/5-10 cardiac output 8.9 My Cardiovascular surgeon based on these results still reccommends repair of mitral valve. What are any commments or suggestions.? Should I go with the reccommedations of the second doctor?,2005,2005,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 59 yr old male; no symptoms of heart disease. History of Hypertension taking Lisinopril-HCTZ 20/25MG tablets. The electrocardiogram monitoring/graph showed text book until I was on the treadmill. I took an Exercise Stress Test as part of an annual physical. The doctor indicated the results as abnormal with anterior ST segment depression. The work up was as follows: HR/RPP/METS: HR at rest: 55/min; Max. HR: 160/min (99% of Target HR: 161/min). Max. RPP: 362; Max. METS: 9:30. BP at rest 142/93 mmHg; Max. BP: 189/109 mmHG; Arrhythmias: QRS: 1627; A: 132 PSV: 3 Significant ST Change: V5: -4:95 mm The test was 7:31 min and recovery time was 5:02 min. During the test there was no shortness of breath; no chest pain or pressure. During the pre-test in supine 2:10 min; METS 1.0 HR 79/min V5 -0.05 Standing 1:20 METS 1.0 HR 81 142/93 RPP 115 V5 0.00 Exercise Stage 1 3:00 min 1.7 mph 10% grade METS 4.6 HR 106 174/107 RPP 184 V5 -0.25 Stage 2 3:00 min 2.5 mph 12% grade METS 7.0 HR 141 189/109 RPP 266 V5 -2.00 Peak Exercise 1:31 min 3.4 mph 14% grade METS 9.3 HR 159 V5 -3.20 Recovery 5:02 min METS 1.0 HR 103 178/102 RPP 182 V5 -1.70 The doctor indicated that this may be a false positive or could be the early signs of something more significant. I do have an appointment with my doctor but I'm wondering; since I have heard that the jury seems to be out on how accurate this type of test. Would this indicate the need for more comprehensive testing. I had no side effects during; after or since the test. John,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 48 year old female who was diagnosed with hypertension at age 39 when I went to the Urgent Care with a sharp pain behind one eye and was found to have a BP of 211/110. I have taken Lisinopril with good results. I have a long history of depression and anxiety and had been placed on Paxil about a year before the high BP started. I had bad side effects from the Paxil and several other SSRIs I tried; so about a year ago I tapered off them. I immediately began having nightmares and panic attacks in my sleep; and did not realize that my BP was extremely high during these events until I had a cerebellar hemorrhage. Luckily; I lived and had no long term effects from the hemorrhage. I have been taking Clonazepam for sleep and Citalopram in the morning for anxiety; and I feel great most of the time. Now I only get sleep disturbances and high blood pressure at the onset of my period. I take Mircette for birth control. My family doctor; cardiologist and neurologist are at a loss for any answers. A cardiology workup turned out all good. I would love to know why my BP only goes high at night; and why only when I am on the inert week of birth control pills. The hemorrhage also occurred the day I started my period. I have been thin and healthy all of my life and there is no family history of high blood pressure.,2008,2008,47,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 48-yo female who had a hypertensive bleed in Feb 2007. I began having hypertension about ten years ago; after my doctor started me on Paxil (coincidence?). I take Lisinopril 20 mg twice a day. I was on SSRIs for nine years and went off of them in April 2006 with great difficulty. I went from sleeping all the time to not being able to sleep at all. I was put on Trazadone and was able to sleep 6-7 hours; but with nightmares interrupting my sleep a few times each night. I did not realize that my blood pressure was going extremely high during the night. It dropped as soon as I got up in the morning; and was always normal when checked in the doctor's office. Then I had a cerebellar hemorrhage after getting out of bed one morning. No one could understand why this happened. I thought about my poor sleep and began checking my blood pressure as soon as I awoke from a nightmare; and sure enough; it was sky high. I am now better with Clonazepam for sleep; except during the last week of my birth control pills (the inert pills). My blood pressure still gets extremely high around the time of my period. Could the years of SSRIs have messed up my hormones and caused my high blood pressure? I had extreme withdrawal symptoms when I tapered off them. Secondly; I feel better while on birth control pills; but have trouble with my BP without the hormones. What could cause that? All my doctors are stumped. Thank you very much for reading my post.,2008,2008,47,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,If patient's ECG; Echo cardiogram and Exercise Tolerance Test; reports are normal then still are there any chance that patient could still have arrhythmia undetected ? (due to some clinical reasons),2009,2009,25,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I was morbidly obese @ 320 pounds; depressed with no sex drive. I managed through working out drop to about 250 pounds in six months. But it was a real struggle doing 3 hours of cardio per day with 30 minutes of strength training 5-6 days a week. But the low sex drive pressured but my wife to get my testosterone checked. It was <20ng/dl with the normal range being 240-850. Virtually undetectable. So about 8 months ago; I was prescribed testosterone replacement; initially @ 100mg every 2 weeks which brought my test levels close to 200; still low. So it was upped to 100mg/week. Since that time my left ventricular wall thickness has increased from 1.1 cm to thickened at 1.8 cm. I have also gained about 30 pounds of muscle to be about 260 pounds. I look like a pro football player and I was very muscular having lifted from age 15-25 years so I chaulked it up to regaining my muscle memory. What I did not like is that my heart has thickened. I dont know if it is because of getting an athletic heart from weightlifting. My weighttraining is not much 8 sets per bodypart once a week with loads of cardio. Blood pressure is labile; meaning somedays particulary after cardio days can be as low as 90/60 with bp meds and I get lightheaded and cant work out. Then if I stop my bp meds it can be 150/90. Drives me nuts. My dose is now adjusted from 40mg of lisinopril to 20mg and my hctz is cut in half to 12.5mg daily. But because I was skipping my bp meds due to the severe lightheadedness almost falling a few times. That it may have contributed to the left ventricular hypertrophy. I did a stress echo and although it showed a thick left ventricle; my exercise capacity was superior having gone 17 minutes on a bruce protocol on the treadmill. Right now; I dont know what to do really. I want to keep my blood pressure low and hope to reverse the thickening but I dont want to have sudden cardiac death in an athlete in the meantime. I am wondering what I can do as far as anti-arrythmics; a betablocker; bystolic or even coreg to slow my heart function down to help reverse this. Cardiologist doesnt know as he thinks its from the testosterone; working out and blood pressure issue. Which all makes sense. So I go from super depressed obese guy to looking fit and muscular (a bit too much for my liking) and also having a meatball for a heart. My goal was to not get diabetes when I started working out hard but now worried about sudden cardiac death from the hypertrophy. I cant go off the testosterone as I cant function and I dont want to quit working out and go back to being obese. Any suggestions and yes; I am definitely trying to keep my blood pressure under 120/80 with the ace inhibitor; just wondering about the betablockers. Thanks,2010,2010,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I'm feeling really strange today and I cannot make it to my doctor until Monday so I figured I might ask here and see what people had to say. I'm a 31 year old male; with GERD and Hypertension. I'm currently taking Nexium 40mg 1x per day and Lisinopril 20mg 1x per day. I am overweight and not as active as I could be. I am 5'8" and weight about 220 lbs. I am a non-smoker and I do not drink frequently or use recreational drugs. Currently I've been experiencing flushing of the face and episodes of light headedness. I did go to my doctor once about the flushing issue but at the time the light headedness was not a pronounced symptom. He tested my blood pressure and ruled that out as it has been well controlled by my medicine. He also drew blood for to test for Gall Bladder issues and my blood sample came back within normal ranges on for all his testing parameters including blood glucose and cholesterol. Today I am flushed once again; I have pretty bad stomach pain to the point where if push on my stomach area it hurts. I also feel as though if I move my head too quickly I might pass out. I am not dizzy nor do I actually pass out if I move too quickly but the sensation is there. The flushing seems most pronounced after eating but can occur at any time and can last anywhere from ten minutes to over an hour. The light headedness comes and goes and varies in severity today is the worst it has ever been and it has been happening since I woke up this morning. Is there any chance this is related to my GERD? Or; should I be looking at other possible causes for this problem. My plan is currently to get back to my doctor on Monday and discuss seeing a gastro-intestinal specialist to further evaluate what is going on with me. Any advice or suggestion is appreciated.,2010,2010,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi I'm an overweight; 35 yr old; soon to be ex smoker (just started Chantix) mother of 2. I have hypertension which is now fairly under control finally. I take Tekturna 300 mg; Cardizem LA 360mg; Hydrodiuril 25mg; and Lisinopril 20 mg. I do have a history of heart disease in my family on both my father and mother's side. Mom had stents placed when in her early 50's. Dad had quadruple bypass at 60 and recently passed from a massive heart attack in March. I have had occasional pvc's since my early 20's. They have increased somewhat over the years but never really concerned me. My mother had them; my siblings have them and I never have felt ill as a result of them. They never really bothered me and I was always told it was normal especially for the women in my family. About 2 years ago I had some pretty bad chest pain while at work and went to the er. My ekg showed Left Bundle Branch Block and ischemia. My bp was pretty high at the time. They gave me nitro and was I was observed overnight. There was no enzyme elevation. I was released the following day and scheduled for a stress test. The test came back normal. I went on for awhile with no problems; except for the HTN. Last January had another episode of bad chest pain that radiated down left arm and into my jawline. Also had a run of vtach...scary. So I had the stress test done again and an echocardiogram. Again; no blockages and echo was normal. Rocked on for a few more months with no problems; just occasional; not really bothersome pvc's. So that's all the history til now. In May I was lying on my right side reading; very relaxed; in fact almost falling asleep when my heart started beating out of rhythm. It felt similar to pvc's but not organized and just more of a flutter and flopping in my chest. This lasted for about 10 minutes. I saw my Internist the next day and he ordered a 30 day event monitor for me. I finished it 2 weeks ago. Nothing abnormal showed on the readings; just the same occasional pvc's and some pac's. I woke up and was getting ready for work this past Monday when my heart went into that weird rhythm again as that night a couple of months ago. I just tried not to panic and thought it would go away. It didn't; it went on for about an hour so I called my dr. He wanted me to come in for an ekg. I ended up stopping at the er because it was closer to get to and the rhythm just felt out of control and would not go back to normal. I started having chest pain with it and feeling light headed too. I was triaged and they said I was tachy at 110 with some abnormalities on my ekg but they didn't tell me what they were. 3 hours later of continuous weirdness and some pain in my chest they finally took me back to a bed in the er. Shortly after I lay on my back the irregular rhythm stopped. They checked my enzymes-normal; did a chest xray and sent me on my way to follow up with a cardiologist. I saw him the next day and he recommended the heart cath to rule out any blockages. The cath (on Wednesday) showed only one artery with hardening; but no blockages. The cardiologist said my heart was "near normal" with everything looking good but that one hardened artery. And the abnormal rhythm didn't return again until the next day. Everyday now I have long runs off and on all day of this strange rhythm; sometimes it feels like 3 solid beats and then 3 little fast ones on top of another. Other times it's totally different. It's very uncomfortable. And it will go on for hours. They happen when I'm walking; sitting; talking; eating; resting. They don't seem to be brought on by anything particular and I have cut my caffeine intake drastically. Since the heart cath results were ok and my doctors really don't seem to be concerned; do I just try to ignore the irregular rhythms and go on? Sometimes I feel light headed; sometimes a little sob. It's just so unusual and uncomfortable. I guess I just feel like this is significant but no one else does so maybe I'm just not understanding how my rhythm can go out of control so quickly like this and then be called "normal." I have started walking daily and have already lost some weight prior to these last episodes to try to get in better shape. My doctor said to continue doing that and stop smoking and I would be fine. My feelings right now about it is if they are not concerned I guess I shouldn't be and when I'm an ex smoker for a couple of months and lost a little more weight if this doesn't go away then maybe I should speak up again? I'm sorry this post is so long. If there is any light anyone can shed for me; thank you. Bess,2008,2008,36,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I was diagnosed with a Bi-Gemini heart last year and my doctor put me on 1 beta of propanolol; for the last 18 months; I haven't felt normal; no interest in anything or anybody; going out or shopping; basically i just wanted to be left alone. all excitement had gone from life. ; I month ago I asked my doctor to reduce the dose; which she did from 160 down to 80mg. although I do feel less tired now but I have sinus type headaches; plus I am so more unrested in myself; and i cannot sleep properly; only getting about 2 to 3 hours a night and I feel as though i cannot win. Are these normal withdrawal symptoms; will they go do or should i increase the dose back again; my doctor has left it in my hands. I also have hypertension for which I take Lisinopromil 20mg Kind Regards; kriss,2005,2008,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?,2009,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,First off; my apologies if this is a bit wordy but I want to make sure I get all the details in. In 2008 I had a work-related injury (I fell into a building foundation) and broke the end of a bone completely off (I don't remember the name of the bone but its in my right ankle...tibia I think but I could be wrong). It was surgically repaired with a plate and screws. For a few years it was fine...a few aches here and there but nothing really bad. But for the last 2 years or so it's been acting up. It starts to hurt more mainly when it's cold/wet outside or I've been on my feet for long periods of time combined with a lot of lifting. There have been days where I'm seriously limping and in pain at the end of the day. A couple of months ago I started seeing a doctor on a regular basis (I just recently got insurance again)....well; not exactly a doctor; he's an APRN. He was recommended to me so I decided to see him. For the most part he's a nice guy and has (to his credit) been very helpful in bringing my blood pressure under control but when I tried to discuss the trouble I'm having with my ankle; he blew it off....he acted as though it shouldn't be hurting and then gave me a speech about how he doesn't like to prescribe anyone any kind of narcotic pain meds. Now I DID NOT ask for any meds of any kind...I just tried to tell him that my ankle hurts. Nor did I bring this problem up on my first visit....I wanted to get my BP under control before I worried about anything else. So now I'm unsure of what to do. I've considered finding a new PCP but I don't want to be seen as "doctor shopping". Nor do I want to be seen as a "drug seeker". I'll admit; it would be helpful to have meds when the pain gets really bad; but honestly I'm afraid to ask for fear of being labeled. If another method besides medication would be more effective then that's perfectly fine...I just want this to be taken more seriously. I'm about to start a new job that has a lot of potential but requires me to do a lot of lifting....and I certainly can't jeopardize it by calling off because my ankle is killing me from the previous day. Here's some basic info about me in case that might be helpful for someone here to give some advice: 37 years old; male; 6ft; 200lbs. Good general health (one minor operation since ankle surgery) and my hypertension is being treated with 20mg Lisinopril daily.,2015,2015,37,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I every one nice to find this forum...I am a 60 year old male who has been very atheletic my whole life...From track and cross country to heavy weight lifting for 30 years.....At the age of 50 I started really getting tired all the time and had very little energy..so quit everything .....Have been talking to my doctors for 10 years telling everyone who would listen that it wasnt right to feel that way.......Any how about three months ago I had a reaction to nyquil that sent me to the hospital...All the symptoms were the same as a heart attack but all the test showed no heart attack no stroke and no nothing.....They put a great cardiologist on my case and it has been a wirl wind of doctors since .....Tons of test 3 trips to Mayo Clinic to meet the best ACHD doctor anywhere( in my opinion) They have found that I have a right coronary artery only.... My left coronary is missing and both my LAD and CX are both attached to opposite sides of the right coronary Have a few more test to go at Mayo in about a week to have a TEE they want to check the back of my heart...They have told me that as of now they dont feel they need to do any kind of surgery....I guess if I were to have a question it would be will I some day in the near future need surgery or can people live into there 80s and 90s with this if treated with meds ....,2011,2011,60,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Bio: 21 year old male; 12% body fat 215 pounds; average diet; physically active. Family history: hypertension; fibromyalgia; asthma; valvular disease; great grandpa died of a heart attack; great grandma of stroke; 3 family members have had their gallbladder removed. Past surgeries: deltoid reconstruction. Medications: lisinopril; Zoloft; Xanax (prescribed but don't use). Symptoms: onset at 16; during mile-run fitness test in gym I suffered extreme chest pain radiating up neck; became cyanotic. Echocardiogram indicated aortic insufficiency +1; EKG yielded no significant findings; normal sized chambers; no hypertension; hypertrophy or other cardiac precursors. Chest pain has persisted every day the past 5 years with a gradual increase of severity that has sped up as of late. Chest pain is localized approximately 3 cm lateral of the sternum at a height of 3.5 cm higher than nipple. Chest pain is a squeezing; crushing pain with occasional spurts of sharp stabbing pain like I'm being harpooned right through the chest. Pain is localized and does not radiate through the chest except for in a fine line up my neck and down my shoulder. Pain is persistent day to day with no relief and work has become difficult due to extreme exhaustion. On top of 8 hours of sleep a night I take a 3 hour nap when I get home. Job is mildly physically intensive grocery store labor. Chest pain is accompanied by purple; swollen hands and feet which I've been prescribed compression socks for. Hypertension has developed over the past few months. Extreme shortness of breath; no wheezing or asthma (had adolescent asthma which my cardiologist suspected I still have so she put me on a formoterol fumarate inhaler which has not provided even the slightest relief in the two months I've been on it); I can't even climb a set of stairs without feeling my pulse pound in my cheeks; hands and neck and feeling like it's extremely difficult to draw a breath. The SOB worsens when seated; lying flat; hunched or bent over; and when exercising. My heart pounds; you can see my carotid throb (not just slightly; but quite a bit) when my heart beats and I can hear and feel my heartbeat 24/7 (not just when i concentrate.... Even when I'm distracted or working). For years my BP never rose over 130/80 and through a BP diary I've tracked it at 155/100-190/120. Doctor prescribed lisinopril to control it. Diet and a healthy lifestyle seem to not affect it at all. My lifestyle isn't very stressful; I don't do any recreational drugs and drink only on occasion. My resting pulse pressure of 85 on average has been linked to heart disease when compared to individuals with a normal pulse pressure of 40 (120-80=40 : 120/80) at a resting rate.. As I'm typing this my BP was 145/60. A second echocardiogram done a few weeks ago revealed both atria were enlarged; the aortic insufficiency had worsened slightly; and my LVPW (left ventricle posterior wall) was mildly thickened. My left ventricle outflow tract has a slightly increased velocity of 1.24m/s. My dads side of the family all has hypertension with completely normal echo's other than my dad who says his doctor told him he has a "sticky valve." He's never had any chest pain or other symptoms associated with his heart. I have a history of prescription drug abuse in my teens; tramadol; Percocet; Vicodin; codeine; Xanax; but it has been 3 years since any abuse occurred. A cardiologist reviewing my echo stated my report came back completely normal and nothing with my heart could be causing my symptoms; including the AI. I've read dozens of published medical articles that say otherwise. Some people have symptoms some don't. I can't find a decent specialist that will take the time to figure out my predicament. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy usually starts presenting itself in the second decade of life; sometimes with mildly hypertrophy other times with none until the disease has progressed. It also often presents with enlarged atria due to increased atrial filling pressure and valvular abnormalities. Sleep study ruled out sleep apnea as a cause of exhaustion. Please; help me figure this out. Cardiomyopathy (if I have it) has a prognosis of 9 years from diagnosis and I want to figure out what's wrong now not later. I can't deal with the symptoms anymore. There's very little quality of life.,2015,2015,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's "Chest AP/sitting" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?,2009,2009,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I recently got my blood tests back and am not sure if I have "Heart Disease" in the classical meaning of the phrase or just a bad reading or "Bad Numbers" which need to be addressed. Can someone please clarify this for me? First off; I'm a recently turned 60 year old man who used to be an athletic type during my younger years and over the years let it all go down the drain it seems. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 almost exactly 2 years ago; and also hypertension for the first time. Although my Hypertension was on the low side then the Dr. Still prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg a day for me which I have taken until recently (he upped it my last visit to 40 mg a day predicated on my own readings showing that 20 mg was not enough (he said that even if there was some disparity that 40 mg a day "wouldn't hurt me' or lower my blood pressure any further and it was ok-and even said I could break the tablets in half after 20 mg and take 10 followed with 10 later if my blood pressure went up again. At that time; 2 years ago he also prescribed 500 Mg of Metformin to be taken twice daily which I have followed to the letter since then; plus 40 mg of Simvastatin or Zocor once a day. I cut the Simvastatin out back in December after having experienced the worst vertigo episode one could imagine-cat scan Dr. ordered at the ER showed no problem like stroke-but the reoccurrence of the vertigo and he prescribed it to probably an inner ear infection or something in that nature. I was prescribed Meclizine for the vertigo if it came back again; which it did (he called it positional vertigo as one position stopped the terrible spinning of the world around me-and the med with some valium did the job..until the next and then the next episode days apart. Then I got on the internet and saw all the horror stories and similar symptoms that Simvastatin caused and stopped taking immediately-Dr. or no Dr’s advice. The vertigo disappeared the next day until 4 months later where I’m back in the ER again and again CAT scan showed ok-but ER Dr. said I did a good thing by eliminating the Simvastatin; citing other problems it could cause besides vertigo down the road. So I took Simvastatin for only 1 ½ years-until the symptoms showed up. My Dr. who is a heart specialist and has been around for a long time was given the ER results and after putting off my visit to him for a long time (ok I don’t like going to the doctor!) realized I needed blood tests done as I was feeling; and still am feeling; absolutely miserable. The results are as follows-just under 2 weeks ago-total cholesterol 199-not bad as it has been worse in the past..but he said my “now” cholesterol reading was not good-somewhere around 274 or 279-my HDL is 25 (has always been bad and fluctuated over the years-highest 38 and never reached that 40 number in this decade); Triglycerides 505 (was over 700 2 years before; got it down with walking and exercise and a fish oil prescription called Lovazo to 180-then back to my unhealthy ways-lot of stress-death in the family and so on-did not help as I have stayed home and secluded for 10 months now-and probably why my vitamin D count according to the Dr. is very very low at 11.6) VLDL is 101; Dr. guesstimates my LDL is around the 140 area due to improper calculation because of high triglycerides; Glucose serum is 116 but the Dr. said because my A1c is 5.4 that’s good as the Metformin is working as it should be. The Dr. made the following changes in my prescription-he finally gave in to my saying that I would NOT take impastation again and prescribed Niaspan 500-wants me to take twice daily if the (“side affects“) improve (improve? “Fahget bout it!”) in a week or so. I read what the side effects are on Niaspan and they are not good at all and I don’t need to go through all that now. He was about to add a new statin to that until he realized that he was giving me too much all at once-as he said later. New Statin down the road (A big Maybe on that one)? I am going to do exactly what I did the last time 2 years ago-sans the impastation-take fish oil omega 3 over the counter-the Dr. said that was ok as long as it did not exceed 4 grams per day-similar to Lovazo-walk and walk and walk; which I did the last time and my lipid results improved dramatically going from about 220 total cholesterol to 167 and my triglycerides dropping from a whopping over 700 to 180 and my HDL going from 27 to 34-some improvement anyway-all in 6 weeks. Then I will tell him I didn’t take the Niaspan (which I believe he suspects I will not take anyway); and after the blood tests see where I am. During the 2 years I had a cat scan done to check on a suspected nodular opacity which was not there as shown incorrectly on the exray (with contrast and one reason I don’t need to go through that horrible toasted sensation all over my body which Niaspan causes plus other side affects). I know this was a long story but since I have not spoken about this and seen the Dr. very rarely in the past 2 years I felt I needed to tell all to the experts on here or people that I consider experts with their vast experience judging from the posts as compared to my limited experience. I’m 5’9 and approx 224 lbs. by the way-and that’s the first thing that is going to go-if I don’t get a heart attack first! Seriously though; wondering if I have “Heart Disease” in the classical meaning of the word (Never asked my Dr. and he’s a bit evasive on such direct questions anyway). Anybody care to help please let me know what you think. I am contributing my 199 total cholesterol to eating a lot healthier these past several months but don’t know what that “now cholesterol” that the Dr. talked about is-as that seemed to be of some concern to him. One last thing-my Dr. made me feel great before I left his office when I asked him what my chances of getting a heart attack were now and he should me this rectangular plastic thing where I saw little lego miniature type blocks-very little and then this block as big as the Washington Monument next to them (that’s me he said insofar as my chances of getting a heart attack) and a slightly taller lego type next to that. Boy I needed that! He did say-”Keep walking” as I was leaving his office which was encouraging of course.,2010,2010,59,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky. Being so close to start with means anytime I don't drink enough; get a fever; have diarrhea; sweat too much in the summer heat... then I totally bottom out my bp. At what kind of pressure do other people feel symptomatic?,2008,2009,41,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and prescribed Humira. I understand that Humira fights TNFa which causes inflammation. Does reducing the inflammation stop or seriously slow the progression of this disease? I am not in any pain and I only have stiffness in my lumbar region at this time (64 year old M; aware of stiffness at least 2-3 years but thought it was a muscular issue).

Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been active for my 30+ years. After being diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy 3 years ago; I find it difficult to start a good training program. I will begin a program and become so fatigued over time that I finally "collapse" days later from being so tired. A couple of times (including this month) I had flu symptoms; for a week.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi. I am a 20 year old female that has had palpitations for 5 years. My father was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and died following a heart transplant in 1993. I am a college soccer player and had been running 20-25 miles a week along with weight training. My palpitations have worsened slightly over the past year and I occasionally get light-headed in the mornings so I went in for a check-up. I had echo's done in 97 and 99 that were unremarkable. (Though they did show a mild to moderate leak of the aortic valve.) My recent echo showed an ejection fration of 30 with slight LV enlargement. The aortic valve leak was said to be trace. My cardiologist restricted me from strenuous activity and put me on Toprol-XL and Lisinopril and is going to have the echo redone in 3 monthes; and I am going back to see him in one month. He said I had some atrial fib during the echo and my heart rate fluctuated between 70-155 bpm. (I could feel palpitations during the echo). I have no symptoms during exersize and my palpitations only bother me at rest. My questions are: 1. Is this something that medication could possibly fix; or am I looking at deteriorateing health and no longer running/playing soccer again? 2. Should I be looking for a second opinion? The doctor did not seem optimistic about "curing" me. 3. How much exersize can I do? Can I do mild/moderate activity as much as I want or could this also be damaging to my health. (I know that some activity is recommended.) Thanks so much. jdd,2002,2002,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello all... I am a 45 year old male 6' 200 lbs. and was recently told I have a mildly dilated ascending aorta. The doctor suggested for me to take Cozaar 50mg/day with yearly follow-up testing. I have to say I am scared out of my wits. I am a otherwise heathy person. I do not smoke or drink. After reading some of the posts on this web site I do not feel so alone. My concerns are physical limitations and the eventuality of surgery. I am a police officer and need to be physically fit for duty. This has humbled a tough guy like myself. My dilation measured 40.1. The doctor discussed avoiding lifting extreemly heavy weight. Is that it? I feel fine. Does someone with this condition eventually confont surgury in the future and when? I would appreciate any feed back. Thank you.,2010,2010,,

After off meds I still had occassional chest pain and headaches going up the left side of my shoulder and neck to left side head.. I purchased a BP machine to monitor it regularly and to show doc on my next visit.. The majority were 140+ over 85+..

Both Grandparents died from stroke.. Dad; bro and aunt are all on BP meds... My doc now has me on .5 Xanax as needed and 10 mg lisinopril.. My BP is now 120+/65+ but these chest pains and tension headaches and fatigue persist.. Which the Xanax does make feel better... My question to you is: Do you see any other possible diagnosis??? Could there be a thyroid issue??? Should I get a second opinion??? I just want the headaches; chest pain and fatigue to go away.. I am now taking an avg of two Xanax a day and don't want to get hooked.... I forgot to mention I own a restaurant w 70 employees and am constantly in high stress situations...

Lisinopril+hypertension,A few days ago I was sitting reading and watching tv when I felt this strange sensation of moderate uncomfortableness/mild pain in the right top of my head. It was enough to make me flinch and be concerned but there was no severe pain. It seemed to me like it might be located under the scalp vs deep inside my head. The sensation seemed to be two separate but closely parallel pulsating streaks like lightening. This lasted only a few seconds then went away. I didn't have a headache; didn't notice any faintness; dizzyness; weakness or change in vision that I could tell. The next day I noticed a steady mild discomfort seemed to be present in my scalp/head alongside the temple just in front of my right ear. My ear seemed to feel some discomfort in it; almost as if I was getting an earache (which I didn't really get) and a feeling of fullness; this feeling also continued on behind the lower point of the jaw joint and down into my neck; like where one might feel discomfort from a swollen gland. Today this sensation still exists and the skin of my face on the right in this same general area feels just ever so slightly numb and tingly; like the very beginning sensation you start to get after receiving a novacane shot. If I turn my head far to the right I can feel the uncomfortable feeling near my temple/ear and neck more. I also have some mild pain if I press moderately hard on the spot on my head that originally had the "lightning like" flashes of discomfort. The same is said if I press on the areas where I feel the discomfort along the temple/ear/neck. Could this be caused by some sort of plaque breaking loose and traveling through an auricular vein? I have not seen the doctor for this yet. I have an appointment on the 18th this month for my 6 month check up for Diabetes type 2; at my last check I was found to now be in the "prediabetic" range. I am taking Metformin 500 mg once a day; and Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 once a day for hypertension. My blood pressure has been in the nornal to high normal range but lately I have been under a lot of stress. I am 41; 5'7" and 305 lbs. I plan on talking to the doctor about this head thing at my appointment but am wanting answers now incase I should try to get in sooner.,2011,2011,41,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am looking for suggestions with regard to "lifestyle changes" (diet; etc.) for people with hypoactive thyroid. For several years I have had a practice of walking an average of two to three miles per day; sometimes more. I eat very little salt and eat more fish and chicken than red meat. PMD recently prescribed Armour Thyroid 60 mg. in the AM due to TSH of 4.88. Selected lab results are below. I read here on the "Armour Health Page" the suggestion that the medication be taken sublingually rather than swallowed. Neither my MD nor my pharmacist mentioned this. I take other meds in the morning (Lisinopril; Wellbutrin; Ritalin; baby aspirin (also inhale Advair and Nasonex); and in the PM; Sanctura; Colace; Xanax PRN; and Ambien PRN) all of which I swallow with obvious the exception of the sprays. QUESTION: Is it important to dissolve the Armour Thyroid under my tongue rather than swallowing? QUESTION: I read on the same page that it's good to divide the dose at least 2x per day; to spread the effect. Again; is this an important point? It's not the way my prescription was written. If it's important; I'll discuss it with my MD. Thyroid issue is new to me. QUESTION: Are any of the OTHER meds listed above known to cause thyroid issues or interactions with Armour Thyroid; including possibly impairing systemic absorption? QUESTION: Would grapefruit juice potentiate (increase) or block the effect of Armour Thyroid? Avoid it? RECENT LAB RESULTS: TSH 4.88 uIU/mL (Range = 0.450 - 4.500) - High Thyroxine (T4) 7.9 ug/dL (Range = 4.5 - 12.0) Triiodothyronine (T3) 135 ng/dL (Range = 85 - 205) Sex Horm Binding Glob; Serum 24 nmol/L (Range = 13-71) Free Testosterone (Direct) 9.0 pg/mL (Range = 7.2 - 24.0) Estradiol 28 pg/mL (Range = 0 -53 / Adult Male 39) - Low LDL 115 mg/dL (Range = 0-99) - High LDL/HDL Radio 3.0 (Range = 0-3.6) Calcium (Serum) 9.2 mmol/L | 9.3 on 1/2/2009 | (Range = 8.5-10.6) Sodium (Serum) 139 mmol/L on 2/1/2009 | 103 on 1/2/2009 | Range = 135-145) Glucose (Serum) 71; fasting (Range = 65 - 99) fasting / 114 on 1/2/2009; not fasting White Blood Count 9.8 on 2/1/2009 | 12.0 on 1/2/2009 - High | (Range = 4.5-11) Red Blood Count 4.74 on 2/1/2009 | 5.08 on 1/2/2009 | (Range = 4.7-6) Hemoglobin 14.3 on 2/1/2009 | 14.9 on 1/2/2009 | (Range = 13.5-17.5) Platelets "Unable to perform adequate platelet count due to platelet clumps" on 2/1/2009 | "Clumped" on 1/2/2009 | (Range = 150-400) "Hematology comments: Differential verified. Slight anisocytosis [red blood cells of unequal size] and poikilocytosis [presence in the blood of poikilocytes]. Few large platelets were observed... Unable to perform accurate platelet count due to platelet clumps. Platelets appear adequate on slide." -- I had prostate cancer; RRP in 11/2006. PSA 0 since; Depression since 2003; ADHD first dx 1982; and Hypertension since 2008. My next scheduled MD appointment is next Monday; with a hematologist/oncologist; to assess the platelet clumping; as well as some unexplained bruising; followed by my PMD the following Monday. I was assessed for this once before; in 2005; with negative findings. Clumping at that point in time was attributed to an anticoagulant agent in the test tubes; rather than any medical condition in me. Recent symptoms: In recent months I have gained about 10 lbs.; despite daily walking and moderate diet. I have felt run down and unfocused; despite meds; anxiety; insomnia. Lipid profile (HDL and LDL) has been healthy from 2004 up to the most recent. LDL is now elevated; and HDL low. It's unclear to me whether the platelet clumping and bruising could be related to high TSH; or if it is entirely unrelated. This issue seemed to concern my PMD more than the elevated TSH. Could they be related? Childhood health history positive for mumps; chicken pox; and unconfirmed rheumatic fever. Family history is positive for hyperthyroid (mother); leukemia (paternal grandmother); and heart disease (father and paternal grandfather); and diabetes (paternal grandmother; sister). -- NOT TESTED RECENTLY; BUT PLAN TO DISCUSS WITH MD: Thyroid Antibodies (TPO and TgAb) - Ferritin – B12 - DHEA – Cortisol – VitD – Phosphorus – FSH - -- Any suggestions or advice would be most welcome; with thanks.,2009,2009,50,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I caught an std over a year ago; with swollen lymph nodes and and a urethral discharge being the first symptoms. I was treated with cipro; with no results and then went to the ER and was given a shot of rocephin; a 1000 mg of Zithromax and prescribed doxycycline. The discharge went away; and the lymph swelling in my left armpit; left elbow and behind my left knee went down by about 1/3; but stayed swollen and irritated for over a year. I had unprotected sex after that with only one woman for a few months; but I always pulled out and never ejaculated in her. We broke up and I still had the swollen and tender lymph nodes. I never tested positive for anything other than that I had been exposed during my lifetime to EBV; so my nurse practioner assumed I had mono; even though I tested negative on mono spot tests. Now a in March I began having sex with a hooker. She has no teeth. After receiving unprotected oral from her I would then use a condom for vaginal sex with her. I had sex with her like this for 5 weeks; then I took a chance at unprotected sex with her; telling myself that if she had anything I would have probably caught it from her through the oral with her having no teeth. Then a couple of weeks after having unprotected sex I began having an obvious std; with new lymph nodes being tender and swollen like the other ones still were. But with taking the Zithromax the swelling went down in the newly inflamed lymph nodes; and with the rocphin shot and more Zithromax the old swollen lymph nodes show marked reduction in size and irritation; although still inflamed. I am wondering if I could have been carrying this std for over a year; and that I may have been the one to infect the prostitute and then reinfected myself. I do not think this is likely; but there is definitely a reduction in the pain and swelling I have had for the prior year. I am on my way to the E.R. now to see about another shot of rocephin and Zithromax; as the stuff almost went away and is coming back again. I'll post on whether they want me to just let it come back for a couple of weeks so they can get a good swab or if they want to just try to knock it out with aggressive antibiotic therapy; as it responds to Zithromax and rocphin but not to cipro or doxy. I am just curious about my hypothesis if I could have been a carrier with no discharge and infected someone and reinfected myself.,2012,2013,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with a small 12 mm tumor on my left adrenal gland. Have had so many tests and they've all come back negative for a pheochromocytoma; yet I have so many symptoms of one. I'm also going thru menopause and many of the symptoms are the same; like sweating; nausea; insomnia; anxiety; heart palpitations; weight loss; but the worst one is blood pressure spikes. I've been to so many doctors and they keep testing or referring me to other doctors. Seen cardiologists; endocrinologists; kidney doc; internal doc. Seems like they all have a different opinion; some say my symptoms must be menopause; others say it may be a pheo. Now I need to wait until November to have another MRI to see if it has grown. This has been going on for almost a year and I am having a hard time handling all these symptoms. I can put up with menopause; but when my bp spikes to nearly 200/100 plus; it gets really scary. Just wondering if anyone has any information on adrenal tumors. I'd hate to have surgery to get my adrenal gland removed when all along the problem was menopause! Any help and information I can get would be great. Thanks.,2011,2011,57,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,My father went to a doctor about his high blood pressure last year and got put on benecar with a diuretic. That made him very dizzy (but brought down his BP right away) so they put him on plain benecar (no diuretic); which still helped his BP; but still made him dizzy. Eventually he started taking only 1/2 a pill a day; which still controlled his BP and still made him dizzy. Recently; he decided that he couldn't handle the dizziness anymore so he went off of the meds entirely (w/o telling anyone). He got a stomach flu the following week; his BP went way up again (170/100) and he went to the doctor. the doctor gave him bystolic to try.. to see if the side effects would be any more manageable for him. he has been on it for 3 days now and his BP has changed from 170/100 to 155/110 to 150/117 today... so the top # is going down; but the bottom # is going up... and I'm worried. My parents want to give it another day or so because they think that he might have been dehydrated from his sickness and that could have made his body retain water and now that he's not as sick; he's still retaining water and maybe it'll adjust itself over the next day or so of not being sick.. But.. I'm worried. does anyone know anything about this? I asked a friend of mine who is a family practicioner and he was.. very alarmed and thought that my father should be hospitalized for severe hypertension... which; i told my parents and they basically told me to shut up :-P Realistically; I'm hoping that nothing terrible is happening to him because he's feeling Ok.. but I'm scared. They called his doctor and the doctor didn't seem too alarmed... just said that they'll probably try a different medication.,2009,2011,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,Three weeks ago I had ablation for AV node reentry; and two other sites as well for atrial tachy and extrabeats. Ep said he got it all. Two weeks ago was put on a Loop monitor and my EP said he seen one atrial tachy 16 beats total and a number of sinus tachy; one up to 120bpm and a number of pac's. Well;last nite around 3am I was awakened from a sound sleep with the worst attach ever;even before ablation. I recorded and sent it in. It was beating at 160bpm+ at times with a few missed beats and was unrelenting. They said it looked like Sinus Tachy. The center told me to call my hospital which I did. The doc asked what I had on hand to take. I had an 80mg fast act Verapamil and 240sr Verapamil. I took the 80 and it slowed the heart rate down to the high 80's. Then took the 240mg. My HB is around 75 this am but it took 1 1/2 hours to get there. This no longer sounds like a normal variant of ablation does it? Also; I am to go on 50 mg Toprol 1xday after speaking with EP's office this am. and was told I could take the fast acting verapamil if it got untolerable as well as the Toprol. Can I mix Toprol with Verapamil? I took pinadole (spelling)one time prior to alation and it made my heart beat fast so was told to quit. Will the Toprol work better? What Could this sinus tachy be from. I don't have any other problems that I know of. Could this be a onetime thing due to post ablation? Can a persons heart beat that fast and long with no bad effects? Also; my bp is naturally low 112/58 usually. Can I still tolerate Toprol? Thanks so much for this board!,2003,2003,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Has anyone experienced blood pressure of over 280 close to 300? Could you please share what you were feeling at the time; all your symptoms etc. It would be so helpful to get insight..thank you!,2015,2015,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65. I am a 41 y/o white male 167lbs. Thanks for any advice or expeience. Andy,1999,1999,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,After having a pain in left shoulder; that nitro stopped; I was given and EKG. The dr. said it was abnormal and sent me to a cardiac sp. They had me on pletal for severe pain in legs(calf) when walking. Pletal caused my pulse to stay above 112; BP to elevate and generally made me feel out of breath. The Cardiac dr ordered some tests and blood work. Then they call; almost in a panic telling me to stop the pletal. I already had the day before after seeing my reg dr. Then they call back at different times telling me my Echo was abnormal; some blood work was abnormal and then to say the stress test was abnormal; showing some blockage in cornary arteries. I was just wondering what I might be looking at as treatment. I have an appointment on the 12th to discuss treatment but was just curious as to what might be coming next. Thanks,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My boss was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and blocked arteries several months ago. He is also a diabetic. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery 4 months ago. He went to all his post operative appointments and progressed normally except for an infection at the site on his leg where the vein was removed for the bypass. He has no insurance; and has cancelled subsequent appointments; such as a repeat heart echo that was scheduled; because of financial problems. His wife asked me to post a question and see if we could get some responses and some information. His chest; where his ribs were spread for the bypass; is sort of concaved in; and she is concerned about this. She feels that he went back to work too soon after the surgery and pushes himself too much; lifts too much; etc. To a certain degree; from my observations; she's right. He is just a very "controlling" individual and has to have everything his way. He simply refuses to admit that he has limits and he feels that his body is rebelling against him. Any information on cardiomyopathy or the matter of the caved-in appearance of his chest would be much appreciated.,1998,1998,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom age 78; has congestive heart failure and has a pace maker. The Doctors have her on Coumadin; Lisinopil; Digoxin; Coreg and Darvacet for pain. She is feeling lousy; diaherria; pain uner her rib cage; shortness of breath; burping or tring to burb constantly; extreme tirediness too weary even to talk some times; to name a few. She has a problem seeing lately and when she sits down she can't catchi her breath. She is in sever pain under the rib cage and has it bullds she panics and just makes it worse. She keeps saying she aches and hurts all over. The doctors just keep giving her more pills. I think the combination she is on could be causing some of the problems. If it is what can we do? I would like her to get out of her present HMO and see some other doctor but I don't know where to start. What kind of doctor???,1998,1998,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,About 5 years ago; I hit leg and got cellulitis. A year fighting this caused toxic shock (septicemia) and an emergency admission to the hospital. Five days of central line antibiotics; 4 different kinds; and 3 courses of it at home; and I was 'cured'. For two weeks after getting out of the hospital; I felt fantastic. Then... everything fell apart. My body failed me at every turn. Was tested for every autoimmune; because they said symptoms were 'classic autoimmune'; but all were negative. Two rheumatologists dismissed me. Went through 4 docs in 2 years. TSH; after 3 months taking 1.25mcg levothyroxine; was 18.9. I'm currently taking 2.75mcg levo morning & .75mcg levo afternoon. Pain; swelling; fluid retention; nausea (vomiting); trembling; spasticity; tenderness to touch; insomnia coupled with severe and debilitating fatigue; inability to concentrate; and more... all still there. They treated with antidepressants; told me I was depressed; said maybe it was fibromyalgia; or a ‘pain syndrome’. Then we got an unexpected break: I was bit by a brown recluse (fiddleback spider). I broke out in a systemic rash. PA gave a shot of steroids. For almost a week; I felt pretty good. I moved to the Houston/Galveston area; and the PA I'm seeing here gave me a steroid shot for inflammation; and the same thing happened. About five days without pain and w/more energy. She wondered about Addison's. She gave an injection and prescription for prednisone 5mg; twice per day. Later; she increased it to 10mg; twice per day. She then scheduled a 24-urine coritsol-it was low-normal. I didn't know to avoid caffeine or that steroids could affect the results. This test was invalid. I had gained almost 60 pounds in fluid water weight; over a three-day weekend period. She freaked out and sent me for an abdomen CT. Results normal. The endocrinologist retested 24-hour urine cortisol. This time; we took the test the right way; with no caffeine; no steroids (had to work off them and stay off them for two weeks to get the test done; and that was tough.) This time; my 24-urine cortisol was low-it was 3; with him saying 5 was low-normal; and that it could account for pain and fatigue; because the body wasn’t healing well; but he mostly blew it off and said it wasn't 'low enough' to cause problems. He also said that the fact I had GAINED weight contraindicated diagnosis; since adrenal insufficiency; particularly Addison’s (or primary AI) usually presents with weight loss and anorexia. I had gained a LOT of weight; super fast. When I insisted steroids made me feel better; and that matched w/low steroid tests; he agreed to an ACTH stimulation test. Endo retested 24-hour cortisol & free cortisol; and results were low again; and that prompted him to order an ACTH stimulation test (Cortrosyn; with cortisol at baseline; 30 and 60). Stim test started at 8am. Baseline cortisol was 4 (not a typo-it was 3.6; to be exact)–was told at hospital it should have been at least 15; preferably 20-25). 30 minute draw was 12 and 60 minutes was 15. Even after stimulation; I didn't get up to ‘low normal’. Doctor called; said; "You failed the test...we need to get you on steroids." He said he was surprised I wasn’t in the hospital—I told him I’ve felt so bad for so long; I didn’t know what was worth going to the hospital for. I had told the truth when I said there were days I literally could not pull myself up physically out of bed. I have tried to find anyone w/numbers as low; to see what dosages were prescribed. I also can’t find anyone’s ACTH stim test that responded the way mine did. I did triple (more than) my baseline; which I've read could be indicative of pituitary showing not enough ACTH to stimulate adrenals to normal levels. Even triple baseline; it was not low-normal. I don't know if that matters. Pain & symptoms came back next day. Because I am overweight; not underweight; and anorexia is a symptom of this condition; doctor told me he didn't think I'd fail; he was surprised I had failed; but he began throwing things at me: take a triple dose if I get sick; call him if I have to triple dose; get a medic alert bracelet and a card; get an emergency syringe dosage in case I'm found unconscious...that's a lot to throw at someone he thought didn't even have this condition. Put me on hydrocortisone; 20mg-morning; 10mg-afternoon; 5mg-early evening. It helped; but pain & fatigue was still there; and I was still puking and unable to eat more than a few bites; but was still gaining weight. In the evenings; the pain was bad. He did another 24-hour urine cortisol; while on hydrocortisone; and I was still a 3... a little bit higher; 3.6 this time; so almost a 4; but still low; even with what appears to be high doses of hydrocortisone. He switched me to dexamethasone; .75 in the morning and hydrocortisone 10mg in the afternoon. He wants to retest urine cortisol in August; but also said to call and let him know if I'm feeling better. He has no tests ordered and no appointment scheduled until August. I've been on dexamethasone for a week now. It's helping. Fluid is greatly reduce (though I'm peeing like crazy!); I'm more active; pain is reduced (no pain in the morning after dosing; but pain comes back in the late-afternoon; early evening); sleeping better; eating better too; less nausea. But symptoms haven’t gone away... does it take time for the steroids to make me feel better? Am I dealing with something else that's being missed? I'm curious why he didn't test ACTH levels at the same time as stim test; because wouldn't that have helped him decide if it was pituitary and/or adrenal; or both? Would that change treatment? They missed this condition for over four years of testing; so I worry that this is secondary to another condition that they are missing; and that my body is just tired from the stress and thus secondary adrenal insufficiency undiagnosed becomes ‘primary’; but the symptoms are for a completely different condition. My FSH; testosterone; estrogen; androgens all normal. I am not in menopause. My thyroid is regulated on the levo; my last TSH was 1.7 (little low; but ok for someone with treated hypothyroidism). Last T3 & T4 tests were a year ago; but were normal on meds. Sodium is normal (I crave salt like you would not believe); potassium has a tendency to go low when on steroids and high when I'm not; but the last two tests were normal readings for me. VitD and folates are normal. Since I have two endocrine issues controlled by pituitary: adrenal insufficiency & hypothyroidism(and suspected but not confirmed diabetes insipidus–but not diabetes (blood sugar is fine or sometimes low); seems to indicate there IS an HPA-axis thing going on. This correlates w/high-dose antibiotics I took in the hospital damaging the pituitary or the septic shock and infection destroying the pituitary. Considering I'm still in pain; though improved; and I'm not scheduled to go back until August; what should I do? Are there other tests I should be asking for? I'm self-pay-money isn't major if tests need done; but I can't throw money away. I have no insurance; so no worries w/approvals. I don't want to continue in pain until August if there's other things we can do. Can I expect to continue to improve with the same treatment or does improvement usually come faster? Am I being impatient and should wait for the dexamethasone to work or is the fact that; after a week; I'm still not feeling great an indication of a problem? I know it's a lot to chew on... I don't expect anyone to have all the answers to all my questions... but I'm spinning in circles here; and thought maybe you guys could give me at least a direction to proceed before Aug; so I'm not just sitting around popping pills that might not be helping or could be hurting. Thanks so much for listening/reading...,2011,2011,40,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Im an a 27 year old female and I am very worried. For the last month or so I have started getting numbess in my hands while awakeing. I would just rubbed them together and everything was fine. Then it progressed. Rubbing them only made them worse; I would have to hang them over the side of the bed for a while for the blood to ciruclate back into my hands for the pain was incredible. I was having neck pains at the same time; so I assumed that was causing the numbness so I had went to the doctors. I had an ex-ray done and nothing was found abnormal.I know something is wrong with me; so i requested an MRI. The results were negative; so they sent me home. Well; the numbness in my hands have gotten much worse since then. The night before last I had awoken every hour on the hour with my hands feeling like they are on fire. Rubbing them only makes them more painful. I found the only solution to make them stop hurting is to run them under warm water. The pain didn't go away completely but it was enough for me to fall back asleep; just to be awoke an hour later with the same unbearable pain. This morning; I cant sleep at all. It went from an hour to 20 minutes of unbearable pain.so bad I cant stop crying. Warm water is the only cure for the pain; but my hands are still numb and they still hurt. This is affecting my work and my sleep. It is only getting worse and I am very worried. Please tell me what may be wrong with my hands and how I can sleep again without so much pain.,2010,2010,27,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Is anyone taking metoprolol? It's driving me nuts! I do have anxiety disorder. And of course knowing they gave me this to lower my heart rate makes me nervous. And with my anxiety disorder I am taking my blood pressure every hour. I know that doesn't help. But dealing wit the metoprolol; it has dropped me to 88/55 at times; today 112/73; then 93/55 then 142/70. I get hot flashes; shakes; tingling arms; a general feeling of panic when I see my reading is low or I feel the shakes.... Could it be the drug? Does anyone else take this and have these symptoms? Thanks,2008,2008,45,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Warm greetings; and many thanks for your valuable time. I'm a 38 year-old female; former runner and mother of three. I've enjoyed good health until a recent pregnancy when I began experiencing unprecedented chest pain; SOB and palps. Multiple work-ups later; including an adenosine cath; I was diagnosed with endothelial dysfunction (coronary flow 2.5); and aortic sclerosis with insufficiency (1.6 and 2+). I take Lisinopril; Eplerenone; Pravachol; Advair and sublingual nitro as needed. I continue to feel periods of chest discomfort with pressure; (relieved by rest or nitro); breathlessness and fatigue after prolonged exertion or extreme emotional stress. I've heard different opinions on my prognosis and treatment plan. 1) What is endothelial dysfunction; a marker for atherosclerosis; heart failure or another disease entity? How common is it? 2) Is small vessel disease reversible; and what is the current research on treating it? What causes it? (I do not have diabetes but did have gestational diabetes). 3) Given that the valve disease is only mild-moderate; would an AVR help cure my symptoms? Isn't valve replacement indicated when INDIVIDUALS become symptomatic? 4) Two weeks ago after a sudden death in my family; my siblings and I discovered that we have Factor V Leiden. Would you consider this an incidental finding; or relevant in terms of my treatment; diagnosis; future caths; etc. 5) I also have mild LAD stenosis from a myocardial bridge. Could these factors combined explain my symptoms or alter my treatment strategy? THANK YOU!!!,2003,2005,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,This started last year. I woke up extremely dizzy; headache and had trouble speaking. Lasted about 4 hours. My eyes were not reacting to light. Months later; while at work I would be sitting and get dizzy out of clear blue. Co-workers often said I was slurring my words; which I was not aware of. Lately I have been waking up dizzy at least 4 times a week; lasting now two weeks. I am nauseated; feel pressure in back of my head; balance is quite off; blurred vision. I have had an MRI; which was normal; A stress EKG; where the EKG was non-conclusive; and the scan showed okay. I have Hasimotos disease; High Blood pressure; extreme Vitamin D defiency; and am taking 50;000ui daily; to have blood checked on June 29th. I currently take Lisinopril 20-25; Atenolol 50; Synthroid ;175; and I have sleep apnea; a Herniated lumbar disk at L3/L4-5. I have involuntary muscle spasms that affect mostly upper body; but sometimes lower extremities as well. I go back to doctor on 29th; and I need to know what to ask for in the way of more testing; because this is beginning to interfere in my daily activities. I am also a smoker and trying like hell to quit; and need to lose about 100 lbs. Any helpful insights would be appreciated. thanks; Karen,2010,2010,56,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Before 2/4 2007; I had been an extremely healthy woman for 45yrs. I was 4'10"; 110lbs & had worked since I was 11. In 2004; I was dx w/hypertension & for 3 years my BP was regulated w/Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25mg & Norvasc 5mg; & I was feeling great. In 12/2006 my insurance co 'recomended' I switch from Norvasc to Lotrel; because it was the same & my copay would be $25 instead of $50; so my doctor called it in. While out watching the Superbowl I suddenly got sick; disoriented; & collapsed. When I got to the ER my BP was 56/48; 3hr later after a bag of fluids & w/a splitting rt side headache & horrible nausea I was discharged w/a BP of 84/56 & told I was overmedicated. Later I found out that the Lotrel dose was 40/5mg; because it actually contained an Ace Inhibitor; like the Lisinopril; as well as the calcium channel blocker thatNorvasc contained. My dosage of ACE inhibitors went from 20mg to 60mg. My Insurance co then cancelled me. My symptoms have progressed over the last 3 yrs to being diagnosed w/Mild to Severve Brain damage Global Cognitive Disfunction; aphasia; speech & memory problems; right side tremors of my rt arm & leg now progressing to my left; dx as Ataxia & probable Dystonia; chronic daily migraines & nausea; w/unequal pupils & photosensitivity in my rt eye now progressing to my left dx as Blephorspasm & Meige Sindrome; Dysautonomia & Vasovagal sympathy w/frequent syncopy events sometimes while just sitting down; Endocrine problems ie thyroid not working; & I stopped having periods & was told I was in menopause. In 9/2009; I was told its been over a year now since your last period; you've completed 'the change'; but over the last couple months have started to have severe bleeding & cramping. Recent blood work is showing I've completed menopause as they thought; but now there are indications of liver problems & muscle wasting & I've gained 35lbs; Chronic GI problems; diarreah & constipation; I have no BP or temperature control & frequently just start emitting heat (no sweating); & twitching; Tachycardia where during my tilt table test my BP went to 117/22; & was told that was normal; at my last neurology appt in Sept; my BP was 180/72 & my temp was 95. He said he wasn't concerned; thought that alot of my symptoms were probably psychogenic due to the 'trauma I believed I had experienced' from the overdose & its affect on my life; but that he wasn't sure about all of them. He gave me samples of Cimbalta & said I should undergo psychotherapy. My next appt is in May; his first opening. All I want are answers to what actually happenned to my brain & body. Out of 6 Drs/Specialist; NOT ONE will relate it to the hypotensive event. They just say odd case; but there's no way my symptoms are related to it; but that its interesting that they all started after 2/4/07. They deflect even my basic questions & had one laugh when I asked about neuronal damage from lack of oxygen & told maybe I shouldn't read so much into my symptoms When I asked for an EEG; he said he didn't see the point. I've been unable to work for the past 3 years & was just denied again for Social Security. I have worked since 1973; & was pre-vet at UC Davis where I worked in large animal ICU & radiology; then a vet tech & practice manager for over 25yrs; so I'm not medically ignorant to basic facts of science & medicine; but I'm not a Dr. Why can't I just get some straight forward answers as to the what happens to your brain & body after a trauma like this like a flowchart of sequence to hypoxia; & what long term effects of medication toxcicity could be happening. ACE inhibitor overdosing "has never really been studied except to say that an overdose could cause hypotension". I'm interested in any info; advice; hypothesis; thoughts anything. I'm willing to be a guinea pig for a Dr; just as long as they're actully interested. I'd rather see a veternarian than another Dr; because at least they repect & genuinely care about their patients.,2010,2010,47,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have an update to the question below that I posted awhile back. I'm updating this in the event someone else is searching for answers to a similar issue. The culprit of my shortness of breath was not the warfarin to treat the DVT in my right leg...it was two blocked coronary arteries! Four days ago; I had an angiogram that quickly became an angioplasty with stent placements into two arteries that were 99-percent and 80-percent blocked. The procedure entered into the artery of my right wrist; not the groin. I was in the hospital about 30-hours and walked out without any assistance or major concerns. Today; I completed a 20 mile bike ride and can't believe how effortless the bike ride was. Thanks to CCFheartMD11 for your spot on response to my concern. My ego seemed to have gotten in the way of the obvious signs of an impending heart attack. Now when I look back at the last few months; walking 4 miles in the snow to get to work....feeling the upper chest discomfort...I kick myself in the arse for doing such a bone headed thing. Now; I take seven pills a day. Aspirin and Effient (expensive!) to keep the platelets from clotting; especially with the new stents. Lisinopril to control hypertension and Metoprolol to treat angina and improve survival after a heart attack. Simvastatin to control bad cholesterol and triglycerides. And of course; one 80 mg chewable baby aspirin a day. I take the Effient; Lisinopril and Metoprolol in the AM. In the PM; I take Simvastatin; aspirin; Warfarin; and Metoprolol (twice a day). I'm still taking the warfarin for the DVT issues. Now I look at the long road ahead as I combat my heart disease. The stenting buys me time to correct and modify my lifestyle to take into account genetic factors and dietary factors that led to my clogged arteries. Of note; I've not eaten egg yokes; milk fat; and have avoided saturated meats for the last 20-years. Those steps taken years ago may be why I'm alive today and not from a sudden death event. My diet will undergo even more severe elimination of food groups. Most of my protein is derived from egg whites; beans; and the occasional chicken anyway. Here is my older post: Dear Medical Experts: Brief background: I'm 48; 6'-1"; 250lbs; body fat around 22 percent (waist minus neck size). Health issues: During March '10; steep ramp up of monthly bicycling mileage from 240 miles to 700 miles left me with sciatic nerve issues the result in my opinion of the piriformis muscle contacting the sciatic nerve. After the second attack; sought treatment at a spinal sports med clinic. During this period; traveled to Australia from US Pacific Coast. Two months after Australia trip and six weeks after epidural injection; began cycling conditioning on stationary bike. Stretching after a stationary bike exercise session released clot that caught behind my right knee. Scan of legs showed old clots and new clots in upper right thigh and lower leg. Begin treatment for DVT: heparin until Warfarin build up in blood with INR 2.5. This brings me to now. I'm still taking Warfarin. Recently; I've noticed an increase in upper chest discomfort during stationary bike exercises. The discomfort begins about 10 minutes into a warm up session. I slow down enough for the discomfort to go subside and keep efforts on the low side to avoid having that pain. Once into the cycling session; I can increase efforts; but can feel that level upper chest discomfort. Now and then; just before it's time to take the Warfarin meds; I notice an irregular heart beat; say; every sixth beat is slightly delayed. Warfarin brochures indicate irregular heart beat and upper chest discomfort as possible side effects. Last week at three month checkup; discussed upper chest pain; CT scan conducted that day. Waiting to be scheduled for stress test. Does my situation sound like blocked arteries OR side effects to be expected from Warfarin treatment? I'm beginning to think the sciatic nerve issues and DVT issues may be unrelated to the recent upper chest discomfort and that I may have blocked arteries. Any thoughts? Thanks; samkel This discussion is related to DVT-Warfarin-Angina .,2012,2012,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,My current issues – Head sensations in clusters (top; sides; and back of head); back pain/aches; bone aches in thighs; calves; and fingers; rushing sound in left ear at night or in quiet room; and pressure in rear sometime entire head. Have CT; MRA; and ENT Specialist scheduled in next two weeks. Am worried about underlying issues even as recently prescribed medications are dulling the sensations; aches; and pains. My recent history is below. Background – 44 year old male; 5’10”; 210lbs. 24 years in military; retired 3 years ago however remained active and in gym 4-5 days per week. Strength workouts on machines and 20-30 minute endurance workouts on treadmill and elliptical machines alternating days. Healthy diet of High Fiber; Fruits; Vegetables; Chicken and Fish during weekdays. Lean meat (pork/beef on weekend). Non-Smoker but drink beer in moderation Fridays and Saturdays. Government Manager/Executive with work behind computer and various meetings throughout week. History of Asthma and Allergies x25yrs however controllable without attacks (Meds – Advair Diskus; Claritin; & Flonase). Family history of heart problems – prescribed pre-hypertension meds in 2006; changed to Lisinopril (20mg) in 2010. Diagnosed six months ago with Chronic Epidetimitis. Meds for 90 days only. Occasional flare ups with aches in right side of groin area. For the past year each time I bend down to tie shoes I feel pressure my head. Past three months have had rushing sound in my left ear main when lying down to sleep. Also noticed when I shower that when washing/grazing my inner thighs I felt tenderness or slight pain but only in this fashion. No other pains when sitting; walking; etc. Additionally; recent drainage and dry voice side effects with Flonase. Also noticed increased blood pressure (135/85). In recent months my body has felt drained after daily workouts. My treadmill runs reduced to 20+ minutes at 10 minutes per mile pace. On 1 March 11; I approached fitness coordinator who gave me new interval program to rev-up my metabolism and energy. Run sessions consisted of walk; jog; run (2min each x 30 minute total) and one day of slow hill run; both on treadmill. Off days on elliptical. Initial reaction to increased speed periods during workouts is minor pain in both sides of kidney area. Not sure if muscular/skeletal or internal however run through pain which went away. After two weeks of sessions one night felt slight pressure in head after cooling down at home. Ignored and went about my usual activity. On 15 Mar 11 decided to see my doctor and gave him update of all recent symptoms. Doctor listened to heart; carotid arteries; and conducted EKG (all OK) and scheduled a stress test. Changed Flonase to Nasonex and added additional 10mg Lisinopril – now 30mg). Discussed aging as cause of potential tinnitus in left ear. Continued to conducted regular gym workouts. Two days later (17 Mar 11) I awoke with left rear temporal lobe; upper neck sensations/aches; and increased pressure in ears. Went to clinic and seen by other doctor who conducted series of hands on exams with my head (vision; ears; puffed out checks; pressure; etc.). Doctor diagnosed no emergency however scheduled ENT specialty appt; CT; and MRA. Next day (18 Mar 11) while driving home began having unusual sensations in my head that moved around. Not much pain however on the top left side; then right side; etc. Took some Tylenol which helped. Throughout weekend had same sensations and used Tylenol occasionally. Monday morning (21 Mar 11) while driving back to work sensations began again. Took Tylenol which helped. Worked out in evening. Tuesday morning (22 Mar 11) awoke with head sensations; back pain and spasms throughout the day. Went to doctor on same day and described symptoms. Another EKG (all OK) and prescribed Butalbital-Apap-Caffeine. Chem 7 Labs ordered. Decided not to workout this day and took one pill (Butalbital) in evening. Woke next day (23 Mar 11) without any pain however as day went on back aches and spasms; head sensations set in. Blood drawn in morning and provided results (all normal) in afternoon. Did not go to gym. Noticed spike in BP that night (145/87) with no symptoms and sleep. Woke next day (24 Mar 11) without any pain however after getting up and moving around back aches; bones aches in thighs; calves; shins set in. Noticed aches getting worse while sitting in office computer chair. Took Butalbital however this only dulled the aches. I can feel the underlying pressure in back of head and in body. Same situation on Friday (25 Mar 11). Took medication with same dulling sensations in head; back and body. Noticed BP has dropped to average of 115/77 over past few days.,2011,2011,,Male

Run sessions consisted of walk; jog; run (2min each x 30 minute total) and one day of slow hill run; both on treadmill. Off days on elliptical. Initial reaction to increased speed periods during workouts is minor pain in both sides of kidney area. Not sure if muscular/skeletal or internal however run through pain which went away. After two weeks of sessions one night felt slight pressure in head after cooling down at home. Ignored and went about my usual activity. On 15 Mar 11 decided to see my doctor and gave him update of all recent symptoms. Doctor listened to heart; carotid arteries; and conducted EKG (all OK) and scheduled a stress test. Changed Flonase to Nasonex and added additional 10mg Lisinopril – now 30mg). Discussed aging as cause of potential tinnitus in left ear. Continued to conducted regular gym workouts. Two days later (17 Mar 11) I awoke with left rear temporal lobe; upper neck sensations/aches; and increased pressure in ears. Went to clinic and seen by other doctor who conducted series of hands on exams with my head (vision; ears; puffed out checks; pressure; etc.). Doctor diagnosed no emergency however scheduled ENT specialty appt; CT; and MRA. Next day (18 Mar 11) while driving home began having unusual sensations in my head that moved around. Not much pain however on the top left side; then right side; etc. Took some Tylenol which helped. Throughout weekend had same sensations and used Tylenol occasionally. Monday morning (21 Mar 11) while driving back to work sensations began again. Took Tylenol which helped. Worked out in evening. Tuesday morning (22 Mar 11) awoke with head sensations; back pain and spasms throughout the day. Went to doctor on same day and described symptoms. Another EKG (all OK) and prescribed Butalbital-Apap-Caffeine. Chem 7 Labs ordered. Decided not to workout this day and took one pill (Butalbital) in evening. Woke next day (23 Mar 11) without any pain however as day went on back aches and spasms; head sensations set in. Blood drawn in morning and provided results (all normal) in afternoon. Did not go to gym. Noticed spike in BP that night (145/87) with no symptoms and sleep. Woke next day (24 Mar 11) without any pain however after getting up and moving around back aches; bones aches in thighs; calves; shins set in. Noticed aches getting worse while sitting in office computer chair. Took Butalbital however this only dulled the aches. I can feel the underlying pressure in back of head and in body. Same situation on Friday (25 Mar 11). Took medication with same dulling sensations in head; back and body. Noticed BP has dropped to average of 115/77 over past few days. All of recent problems seemed to come out of nowhere. Did I injure myself with the new exercise routine? Is some underlying issue that been progressing without symptom for the past year?

Lisinopril+hypertension,Maybe a more productive way to look at post-tx issues and how we might best be able to return to a healthy; symptom-free life is this: It might be a good idea to find out what our forum members have been doing to overcome any post-tx problems they have encountered. Many of us have described problems with depression; pain; mental fogginess; lack of motivation; fatigue; neuropathy; sun sensitivity; rashes; etc. after ending therapy. Rather than try to assign a specific cause to these problems; which always seems to provoke an uproar; let's just discuss how we might overcome these problems; and begin to regain our health. If any of our members have experiences that they wish to relate; regarding their post-tx challenges; and how they have coped; or are coping; this would be a great opportunity to share those insights. This also might provide an opportunity to see a cross section of the forum; and understand how they are feeling and functioning after completing therapy. Please let us know whether you are SVR; or still have the virus. Personally; I am trying to avoid lots of direct sun exposure (I now get a Lupus-like reaction). I use Restasis for the dry and inflamed eyes; and it seems to be working after almost one year of use. I try to get extra sleep each day; and find I feel somewhat more energetic most of those days. I still do fall into unexplained bouts of lethargy; not really depression; but just lack of motivation. I do not feel the drive that I did before tx; or during tx; and often continue to feel spacey.

Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. How does medicine help control high blood pressure? For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Doctor and Poster: What is NSAIDS?

Lisinopril+hypertension,Russert's untimely death raises questions about how we're treating heart disease Dear Friend; You won't hear me say this often about anyone in mainstream media; but T. Russert; newsman and anchor of Meet the Press; was someone I respected. I took great joy in watching politicians squirm under his tough questioning. So; like most Americans; I was sad to hear the tragic news of his sudden death. After all; Russert was just 58 years old — relatively young by today's standards. According to his doctors; he had diabetes; heart disease; and he was overweight. Yet without fail; every time I hear a news story or read an article on his death; the commentators express their surprise that something like this could happen to someone who was on blood pressure pills and cholesterol drugs; who exercised routinely (in fact; he worked out on the treadmill the morning he died); and who was on a diet. He'd even recently passed a stress test. I wish I could say I was shocked by this news. Unfortunately; stories like this one only highlight what I've been telling you all along: Blood pressure doesn't cause heart disease; high cholesterol drugs aren't cure-alls; and exercise can do more harm than good. In short; none of the steps Russert's doctors told him to take to address his health concerns were doing a darn bit of good. Instead; if someone had told him to focus on keeping his homocysteine levels low and his magnesium levels high; we might not be having this conversation in the first place. Homocysteine makes cholesterol stick to your artery walls and can also contribute the hardening of your arteries. It's simple to control your cholesterol levels by loading up on B vitamins; like B6; B12 and folate. Magnesium also has vital heart-healthy benefits. "Statins don't protect against heart attacks. And [Russert] didn't know that the lack of one nutrient could have cost him his life;" said acclaimed neurosurgeon Dr. R. B. "The number-one cause of sudden cardiac death is magnesium deficiency. Cardiac patients and those with diabetes have the lowest magnesium levels of all." I've written to you before about the many benefits of magnesium. This mineral prevents blood clots; dilates blood vessels; and can also stop the development of dangerous heart irregularities. It's why I've been such a long-time advocate of increasing magnesium intake for its heart-health benefits – not to mention what it does for your bones and bodily tissues. I've even used magnesium in emergency medicine to help limit brain damage in stroke victims. And yet more than half of Americans have a magnesium deficiency. "People who are deficient in magnesium are most likely to have sudden cardiac arrest; and when they do arrest; they are harder to resuscitate;"DR. B. says. "Many simply can't be resuscitated." Dr. S. B. surgeon in chief of New York's M. Medical Center; did a good job of summing up just why the death of the beloved newsman has so shaken both Americans in general and doctors in particular: "It makes us all feel mortal; and it also highlights the natural history of this silent killer and our limited ability to catch this killer before it strikes."

Lisinopril+hypertension,I would like to know if a patient that has a 3+ reguritation of the left ventricle would ever be able to strengthen the valve without drugs or physican intervention? How important is it to have this monitored?,2007,2007,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,They come; they go. One month exercise causes them; the next month exercise is the only time they don't pester me. For months I could predict ovulation to the DAY just by the palpitation pattern. Now; there's no discernable pattern at all. I'm a person who needs to know how things tick. It's more curiosity than anxiety. It's a drive; a need to know. I took apart all my toys as a kid because I wasn't just content to play with something; I had to know the mechanics of it. Why does the doll talk? Why does the car go when you wind it backward and let go? How do the wheels on this thing stay on it? And this is exactly the same. SOMETHING causes these PACs. While we all know the traditional triggers; something is changing that makes us more prone to them. WHAT!!? A combination? No; because I could have HALF the usual combination and I feel this way; or the entire puzzle and have no symptoms at all. It seems a few of us developed atrial arrhythmias after having children. Clearly; this isn't limited to people who have cardiovascular problems in pregnancy (PPCM; pre-eclampsia; etc.); in fact I think most of the women who develop palpitations afterward have otherwise very normal hearts. So what is it about pregnancy that does it? Hormones? Cardiac structural changes? Are there different states similar to pregnancy that bring about new PACs and SVTs for people? Is it all in the hormones? Is it autoimmune? Is there an inflammatory process? Is it somehow environmental? I'd be interested in how it stacks up statistically too; for instance; how symptomatic are people in the northern US versus the southern US? And east and west too; for that matter. Does time of year make a difference? And are all the things that "help" also just coincidences of timing? It's enough to keep a researcher happily busy for a very long time. You know what I'd like? I'd like enough money to go to medical school. I'd go into cardiology/electrophysiology and would devote my career to searching for the answers to the questions that keep us up at night. Sometimes I kick myself for not following my dream of becoming a cardiologist; something I wanted long before I ever knew what a palpitation felt like.,2004,2007,28,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,48 y/o nonsmoking slightly overweight female. Low total chol (144) and good hdl. Mild hypertension on Lisinopril and HCTZ. No other meds. 2-3 years ago had a stress test and stress echo after very mild bout of what I thought was minor chest pain; all ok at that time. I've pretty much dismissed any thoughts of problems since then. Couple weeks ago while driving was hit with intense sternal chest burning/pressure that was so painful I felt I might pass out; but didn't. A burning "flush" type pain went up my throat to the lower part of my face. It took about 15 min for symptoms to abate while I contemplated calling 911. I chalked it up to bad heartburn and thought I'd go to the doc if it happened again. Last week; it happened again while I was simply sitting down. Not quite as intense; but exactly the same severe burning in my chest; with the weird flush/burning up my throat to my lower face. This time; it only lasted 6-7 min and wasn't quite as bad. I didn't go to the doctor. I feel as though I would be very low risk for any cardiac blockage; due to my low cholesterol; nonsmoking etc. Someone at work mentioned it could be an esophageal spasm. I hate to be an alarmist; in light of the good stress testing a couple years ago and low risk status. What is your take on this? Should I to to the doc and have another stress test? This happened at rest both times. I have zero problems during strenuous activities. Or just take a wait and see approach? I don't generally ever have heartburn; but I suppose it could be reflux. Thank you.,2005,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 39 yr old female that has been diagnosed w/Endothelial Dysfunction and Metabolic Disorder and still have uncontrolled blood pressure and heart rate. We have been working with this problem and unexplained arm pain and heaviness since July 05' and I am now starting to experience being winded upon any type of activity; including a shower. My cardiologist has done a heart cath; heart CT; stress test; & blood work which have all come back normal. We have even looked for secondary sources of HP w/Renal CT; 24 hr urine; possibility of some tumors; and blood work and those have come back normal also. I do experience swelling in the legs; feet; hands; and mid section and it's not uncommon for me to gain 5-8 lbs in a week or so; the diuretics help some but not always. I am currently taking Micardis; Toprol XL (100 mg 2x daily); Imdur (30 mg 2x daily); Digoxin (240 mcg daily); Maxide; Lasix (PRN); Potassium; Amaryl; Glucophage; Tricor; Paxil; and Pravachol.

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 70 year old male; and have been in A Fib for the past two months. In addition a echocardiogram has shown damage to my heart muscle. I have hypothyroidism (essentially no thyroid function) and have been taking Thyroxin (full replacement for the past 25 years. I am currently taking digoxin; lisinopril; cardevilol; coumadin; and occasionally lasix. The cardiologist I have been seeing (I have only seen him twice; and will not see him again since he is leaving my HMO) has precsribed amiodarone-presumably as a means of possibly restoring my normal sinus rythym. What I have read about amiodarone on the internet; and elsewhere - patients taking it should be closely monitored. This makes me a little reluctant to start taking this drug- at least until I see my new cardiologist. At the moment no appointment has been set up; and judging from previous experience-it could take several weeks for this to happen. In spite of all this; I feel pretty good. Some informed advice would really be appreciated. Howard -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Howard; Thank you for your question. Amiodarone is a good medication for controlling afib; but as you know has many potential side effects. You will need good follow-up while you are on it - particularly with regard to adjusting other medications such as digoxin which may be affected by the amiodarone. I have enclosed some general information about afib. As far as specific treatment options you will need to discuss with your cardiologist. *************** Atrial fibrillation Definition: A disorder of heart rate and rhythm in which the upper heart chambers (atria) are stimulated to contract in a very rapid and/or disorganized manner; this usually also affects contraction of the ventricles. Causes; incidence; and risk factors: Arrhythmias are caused by a disruption of the normal functioning of the electrical conduction system of the heart. Normally; the atria and ventricles contract in a coordinated manner. In atrial fibrillation and flutter; the atria are stimulated to contract very quickly. This results in ineffective and uncoordinated contraction of the atria. The impulses may be transmitted to the ventricles in an irregular fashion; or only some of the impulses may be transmitted. This causes the ventricles to beat more rapidly than normal; resulting in a rapid or irregular pulse. The ventricles may fail to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. Causes of atrial fibrillation and flutter include dysfunction of the sinus node (the "natural pacemaker" of the heart) and a number of heart and lung disorders including coronary artery disease; rheumatic heart disease; mitral valve disorders; pericarditis; and others. Hyperthyroidism; hypertension; and other diseases can cause arrhythmias; as can recent heavy alcohol use (binge drinking). Some cases have no identifiable cause. Atrial flutter is most often associated with a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or surgery on the heart. Atrial fibrillation or flutter affects about 5 out of 1000 people. It can affect either sex. Atrial fibrillation is very common in the elderly; but it can occur in persons of any age. Prevention: Follow the health care provider's recommendations for the treatment of underlying disorders. Avoid binge drinking. Symptoms: sensation of feeling heart beat (palpitations) pulse may feel rapid; racing; pounding; fluttering; pulse may feel regular or irregular dizziness; lightheadedness fainting confusion fatigue shortness of breath breathing difficulty; lying down sensation of tightness in the chest Note: Symptoms may begin and/or stop suddenly. Signs and tests: Listening with a stethoscope (auscultation) of the heart shows a rapid or irregular rhythm. The pulse may feel rapid or irregular. The normal heart rate is 60 to 100; but in atrial fibrillation/flutter the heart rate may be 100 to 175. Blood pressure may be normal or low. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring--Holter monitor (24 hour test)-- may be necessary because the condition is often sporadic (sudden beginning and ending of episodes of the arrhythmia). Tests to determine the cause may include: an echocardiogram a coronary angiography (rarely) an exercise treadmill ECG Treatment: Treatment varies depending on the cause of the atrial fibrillation or flutter. Medication may include digitalis or other medications that slow the heart beat or that slow conduction of the impulse to the ventricles. Electrical cardioversion may be required to convert the arrhythmia to normal (sinus) rhythm. Expectations (prognosis): The disorder is usually controllable with treatment. Atrial fibrillation may become a chronic condition. Atrial flutter is usually a short-term problem. Complications: incomplete emptying of the atria which can reduce the amount of blood the heart can pump emboli to the brain (stroke) or elsewhere--rare Calling your health care provider: Call your health care provider if symptoms indicate atrial fibrillation or flutter may be present. The links below are good sources of information about atrial fibrillation. http://www.med-edu.com/patient/arrhythmia/atrial-fib.html http://www.americanheart.org/Heart_and_Stroke_A_Z_Guide/afib.html http://www.merck.com/!!vDXoe16kTvDXpz08Of/pubs/mmanual_home/chapt16.htm I hope you find this information useful.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I am 52 years old and have been to 5 different doctors trying to figure out why I had 2 ER trips with "crashing fatigue" no one could figure it out and called it just stress and tried to give me meds.. The meds made things worse and now I am just on HRT and feel much better except I wake up frequently throughout the night and have been awakened lately with a racing heart and a burning sensation on the left side as well. Has anyone else had this happen to them? Also could the HRT be causing this.. I didnt have this until the doctor said I needed HRT. Also I am easily stressed; very sensitive to stressfull situations and the such.,2011,2011,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; my name is Marcie. My husband is the one with a GI problem and we have no diagnosis after numerous tests. His signs and symptoms are right and left lower quadrant abdominal constant pain. The pain gets worse at times and diminishes at times. He states his pain is stabbing and constant. Nothing really makes it feel better or worse; except lying in the fetal position. He also has about 6-15 bowel movements a day depending on how he feels. His stool has been loose and watery for about 7 weeks; but now is softer and formed; sometimes black in color and sometimes light brown. He constantly feels like he has to have a bowel movement and cannot go anywhere or function with his activities of daily living because of it. He has lost about 20 pounds within four weeks without trying. He also suffers from nausea; belching; and blood; fat; and mucus in stool; and abdominal cramping. Other symptoms at times is chest tightness; body aches; waking up in middle of the night to defecate; blurry vision; fevers that come and go (max. 102.0 degrees F); flushing to face; and difficulty breathing. He also feels weak and has had loss of appetite. He is depressed because he cannot function in life without a toilet nearby. His medical history includes Hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and HCTZ; chronic sinus infections; and 7 years ago (age 23) his left arm became paralyzed with no explanation by the doctors. He regained feeling and strength to his arm after a year of rehab. He is 30 years old now. We saw a family doctor who tested his stool for Ova and parasites and did blood work on him on October 20; 2010 with all results being reported normal. We were referred to a Gi doctor who performed a colonoscopy on Nov.12th; 2010 with a diagnosis of "nonspecific colitis." The doctor states "a possible carcinoid tumor was observed around the appendix and also stated the appendiceal orifice appeared somewhat unusual with wide mouth and mucosal changes." The doctor also stated; "Terminal ileum was slightly friable and mildly congested; throughout the colon; there appeared to be some nonspecific edema and congestion and mild erythema." Biopsies were taken from the colonoscopy. The microscopic description states the " the appendiceal orifice; the terminal ileum; and the right colon show an unusual amount of lymphoid tissue with no well defined germinal centers. The biopsy from the appendiceal orifice and terminal ileum were sent off for further immunohistochemical analysis to exclude a lymphoproliferative disorder; which came back benign; and suggestive of chrons disease. A small bowel series was performed on 12/03/2010 to rule out chrons disease and what a surprise; it came back normal. This doctor referred us to get a CT scan done of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV and oral contrast to check for carcinoid tumors; which was done 11/17/2010. The results of this exam stated only a mildly fatty liver with the impression of a "grossly stable abdomen." Furthermore; we were referred to the cancer center to rule out carcinoid tumor. He was tested for 5-HIAA in a 24 hr urine collection; cbc; cmp; chromogranin A panel; clostridrium in stool; gastrin level in blood; LDH; Ova and parasites in stool; Retic count; and serotonin blood level; as well as campylobacter; salmonella; shingella panel in stool samples. All of these are to rule out carcinoid tumors; and they all came back negative. We have a follow up appointment with this GI doctor and will see what is suggested next to rule out this rare disorder. We don't know what to do. We will probably get a second opinion; but really can't afford it. Our life is on hold because of his illness which; I’m afraid; is not going to be diagnosed. He has been on Asacol medication since November 8th and is not feeling any better. We are afraid this is not going to be diagnosed and may be a mystery diagnosis; which he cannot go on living this way. If you can suggest any other ideas; rare diagnosis; or anything at all; we would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much. ??????? -Frustrated husband and wife,2010,2010,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi I have read that a lot of people get palpitations. I have suffered from them over the past few years as well as suffer from anxiety and panic attacks (which are fairly well controlled now). I have just recently finished having a 24 hour moniter; ECG (EKG); Stress test and Echocardiogram. The only thing that showed up on any of them was the 24 hour halter moniter....it showed that I was having rare PVC's and PAC's.My problem is that over the last two days I now get palpitations when ever I lay down from standing....I have even had a couple when I have sat down quickly. I took myself to ED (ER)this morning as it is freaking me out. I have never had them before when I lay down. Of course they did not catch any and said they are benign but it really has me worried. Why all of a sudden would this develop. I am a 38 year old female. I have my period at the moment but never had these with any other period. Has this happened to anyone?????,2006,2006,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,After 2 years on thyroid meds; I would think I would be in a better place. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and hypothyroid about 2 years ago and most of the time I still have had horrible symptoms - both hyper & hypo. I am now concerned that I have Secondary Hypothyroid instead of Central because my TSH has always been low with a low Free T3. Last week these labs were taken by my PCP because of high blood pressure - after seeing the results; he sent me to my Endo. PCP Lab Results last week: TSH: 0.32 Range: 0.34 - 4.00 Free T3: 2.59 Range: 2.50 - 3.90 Free T4: 0.84 Range: 0.58 - 1.64 So; I went to my Endo (who only ran TSH) and she told me I was in the Normal Range and I was where I need to be - end of discussion. ENDO's Lab Results this week: TSH: 0.365 Range: 0.34 - 4.00 My symptoms are high blood pressure; constant anxiety; heart palpitations; weight gain; depression; puffy upper eyelids; low blood sugar and always tired. So; as you can see - I'm having both hyper and hypo symptoms! All I know is that I feel horrible - not myself at all. I've been told to take Xanax for the anxiety; but I feel that is covering up a physical issue so I don't want to. Doctor put me on Lexapro for depression - I'm up to 30 mg a day (higher than normal dose) and don't feel better. I'm concerned that the problem is with my Pituitary since with a low TSH - I'm still in the Low-Normal range of Free T3 - even though I take T3 every day (I also take T4). Am I totally off-base here? My Endo makes me think so. I'm 58 and can't imagine feeling this way for the rest of my life. A little background - I had 5 miscarriages in my 20's; always have been hypoglycemic; problem with depression since my teens; I've always been lethargic - so; I believe I may have had undiagnosed hypothyroid most my life. I was also told recently by my doctor that I am "cured" of Hashimoto's since my antibodies were below range. I'm so frustrated and confused... anyone have any ideas? Thank you!,2014,2014,,Male
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had anxiety ever since I can remember and I had my first panic attack at age 11. Throughout my life; I have become obsessively worried about various things - first it was nuclear war; then the world coming to an end (these worries were going on when I was a kid); then it became my health. I have been obsessed with the belief that I have a heart arrhythmia that is going to kill me for a long time now; I started fearing this because I have heart palpitations which doctors and cardiologists have all told me aren't dangerous and there is nothing wrong with me. It got to the point about 2 years ago when my heart was all I thought about; all day every day. I almost failed out of a top 10 college and my life was miserable. I went through an intensive therapy for health anxiety and got better for a while but now I'm getting bad again. I am starting to think and worry about my heart 24/7 and I have massive; horrible headaches; too (probably from the stress and worry). I have been offered every medication under the sun by too many psychiatrists to count; but I am scared of taking anything but a beta blocker and Xanax. What can I do? I can't afford to go thru therapy again right now - plus it didn't help all that much to begin with. I am TERRIFIED of the thought of taking an SSRI - I'm scared of the weight gain and the heart palpitations it may cause. I don't know what to do; I can't let myself spiral out of control again.,2004,2007,28,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Wondering if anyone has experienced low oxygen saturation levels? I went to a pulmonary specialist for a consult on sleep apenea. Took the pulse; blood pressure; etc. and then said "ohhh your oxygen saturation level is 84%. Kind of low." He then set me up for a sleep study. Anyone else experience the same?,2006,2006,105,Male

Lisinopril+hypertension,I had my cardiology appt ; consulatation today for first time and now I am more confused than ever. Why is it that dr.s can not agree on tests results; etc? After my apparent heart attack early April; Severe squeezing pain to mid chest; pain to jaw; sweating; nausea; rise in blood pressure; feeling faint; feeling of impending doom; lasted about 15 minutes; went home.not to E.R. ( big mistake.) has stress test May 12; 08 Test was given a Persantine injection ; since I can not use the tread mill; allso radioactive dye to take pictures of heart. The test showed what is called REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT; THE REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT N THE INFEROSEPTAL REGION AND THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOKINESIS OF THE SEPTUM AND INFERIOR SPETUM NEAR CARDIAC APEX. AND MID CARDIAC SEGMENT. THIS AREA DOES NOT PERFUSE NORMALLY ON STRESS IMAGING;. THE SIGNIFICENCE OF A PARADOXICAL PERFUSION DEFECT VARIES BUT THIS CONDITION MAY OCCUR WITH A RECENT MI. PARTICUARY AFTER REVASCULARIZATION OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.CLINICAL CORRELATION IS ADVISED. My dr. accepted this as the result of my chest pain episode in april; all the classic symp. of a MI. The dr. forums here; Clevleand Clinic advised that is sounds as if I did indeed have a MI; though mayby a lilttle one; and that I would possibly need an echocardigram with left heart catherization and hopefully the Myocardium was only stunned and still alive. Now the Cardiologist I saw today didnt neccesary think the same thing; he said there are lots of reasons for Chest pain; but could not specify one; ( I don't have heartburn; indigestion; panic attacks; pleurisy; pneumonia; chest muscle pain or pulled muscle; gallstones or stomache pain; these are the obvious ones. ) I think one thing that threw him off was the fact that my chest pain episodes do not have any particualr pattern; and occur at any time of the day without exercise stressors. I get squeezing tightness in chest; burning pain in my throat; shortness of breath; nausea ; faint feeling; rise in blood pressure and heart rate; and fear. Need to sit down. The nurse even said; ' don't call them Angina." I don't know what else to call them as I have never had them before this MI ( feeling...) in April. I can not predict when they will occur. The nurse allso considered my blood pressure of 148/84 ( normal and good ) after taking my blood pressure pill????Anyway; the dr. decided to do the Cardiac Catherization to rule out once and for all what I have or don't have going on with my heart. Are all dr. s this hard to get an opinion ; why do dr. s disagree so much? Has anyone else out there had a reverse Perfusion Defect on their Stress test? I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to think. Is it allways so hard to diagnose problems like this? If I would have gone to the E.R. I would not be having this problem now. There is a part of me that wishes I would have an attack in front of a dr. so I can get a diagnosis. It should not be like that. Any ideas.? fluffypurrcat,2007,2008,54,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,How prevalent is it for some paitents to be prescribed Flecainide for PVC's by their doctors / cardiologists and told to go home and take their first dose and I'll see you this time next year; as I was told; instead; of having the patient admitted for hospital or clinical observation / testing in order to see how their body responds to it first? In my case; I declined the Flecainide for various reasons. Bon-Bon,2007,2009,,Female

Lisinopril+hypertension,Had a stent placed in L main coronary artery (95% blockage) 2 months ago. Prior to the stent I had been extremely athletic. Even after coronary ischemic attacks which began just before the angioplasty; I passed stress test with flying colors. After the blockage was discovered thanks to a persistent PCP; and the stent inserted; I had chest pain afterwards. Was re-catheterized; all the major arteries were given a clean bill of health; but was placed on a beta blocker. Terrible reaction to the first one; put on a second one; and finally my cardiologist took me off that one as well. Although I see some improvement; I still have chest "aches" on exertion. All on the left side; below the heart;; in the side; sometimes in the back of the shoulder; and above the breast. Can not walk at a normal pace. Walk very slowly to control the pain. Cardiologist suggested cardio rehab which will begin in a few weeks. But have not heard of anyone else with such symptoms. Don't know if I should risk walkin through the pain; or if it is a symptom that should be further pursued; and or tested. All of my blood work; tests have come back normal so far. Should I be concerned?,2008,2008,52,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been considering purchasing a Resperate; a biofeedback device that costs about $300 and -- according to some fairly impressive clinical studies -- is effective in significantly reducing BP in something like 70-75% of those who try it (or more). Well-controlled studies appear to have been done; the comnpany seems quite reputable; etc. But I sure would like to hear independently from some folks who've successfully (or unsuccessfully) tried this device before spending the money. Just yesterday I learned of a competing device; also around $300; called the Zona Plus. Works on a completely different principle; ALSO seems well tested with an interesting history (it emerged from jet fighter technology). It frankly sounds a bit easier to use; and they claim it is effective in over 90% of patients; and with a better result to boot. But it is available ONLY from the manufacturer -- Google produces almost no hits on it. The scientific papers they cite seem; mostly; generic rather than specifically about the Zona Plus itself. Harvard Health Newsletter did do a full-page spread on it. Anyone with experience with this device?,2007,2007,,

I have few allergies - Texas Mountain Cedar; cat dander; molds; but they typically present as respiratory or sinus complications; not dermatological.

Lisinopril+hypertension,My father had quadruple heart by-pass surgery a month and 1/2 ago. He still hasn't fully recovered. He has been a diabetic since he turned 52. He is now 67 years old. He has repeatedly had fluid around his lung that has been drained off by his heart doctor; but it keeps coming back. He has trouble breathing and every time this procedure is done; he has more and more liquid drained from his lung. The first time it was 1200 ccs. The second time 2800 ccs. He had it drained again today; and my mother told me that there was even more fluid. My father says that he has trouble breathing and feels like he is drowning in all this fluid. My father has had alot happen in a year's time. He had total right knee replacement surgery in April 06; eye surgery on his one and only eye in April 07 - the other eye is a glass eye due to an old coal mine accident 39 years ago - and a month or so ago this quadruple heart bypass surgery. My thinking is that he is too weak to get rid of this fluid on his own. The doctor said that the next time this happens; my dad will be admitted into the hospital for a couple of days for a procedure where the doctor will drain off the fluid again then put some sort of sealent around the lung so it won't fill up again? (I'm not sure if I'm wording this properly.) I guess; my question is why didn't the doctor do this before now? Is it a risky procedure? Why is the fluid amount getting larger and larger every time?

Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I have been dealing with this problem for 2 months now. My head feels as though I have high fever; but my body does not have a fever; I have taken my temperature numerous times without any indication of heat. Normally it is around 98.4 degrees. I have two points on my head that are painful to touch; however when I place a hot bottle of water on those points; the heat on my head is alleviated for a brief period of time; usually 3-5 minutes. Also once I remove the bottle of hot water I begin to experience headaches. Often I have a dizzy feeling after any type of labor. I also have the pain isolated to the left side of my head. When I use the hot tub; my forehead stops feeling hot; and I have general relief; but this stops within 5 minutes of leaving the hot tub; and my head heats back up again. I also notice some floaters in my vision; however an eye doctor ruled out anything suspicious. I recently had a CT scan which came back negative for tumors or other brain abnormalities. I have a history of circulation problems; and I often have cold feet and hands. In addition I have a scoliosis; but my back is not more then 15 degrees of curvature at any one point. I believe that I may have severe circulation problems and as a result decreased blood flow to the head and the warming feelings associated with that.,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Doctor; A few months ago while checking my pulse; I first noticed my heart skipping beats. This now happens regularly throughout the day. I never had this problem before.

Did the Zestril do this to me? Could a blockage cause these skipped beats? Thank You....for your time.,2001,2002,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat? I am wating to see an electrophysiologist for an EP study to see what is going on. My hope is that this can be corrected quickly. I am taking metroporal and asprin daily. I am way too young for heart problems; and the stress is what is bothering me most! Can stress and anxiety cause Atrial Fibrillation??,2007,2007,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 38 yr old female. About a year ago I started to experience a very strange feeling that occurs periodically when I move from a sitting to a standing position and start to walk. The sensation is as if my head and neck are throbbing with pressure and I have to stop walking or slow down and stop and stand still for a minute or so to make the sensation stop. Sounds are muffled in rhythm with the pulsations and I sometimes feel as if I will pass out; but never have. There is no pain. I have been checked throughly by my GP; a cardiologist; and an electrophysiologist and none of them could find a cause. It does seem to happen sometimes when I am hungry and have missed a meal or eaten later than usual. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.,2007,2007,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying "well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this. I mean; I feel like i try to do everything right...I eat fairly well; I'm definitely not overweight; dont smoke or drink; somewhat active...the only thing I have trouble with is my anxiety.

Lisinopril+hypertension,My therapist suggested I start looking for answers on the internet again... I have been cured and off all meds for two years but still suffering and do not know where to turn. I have been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue; Systemic Yeast Infection; crazy weight gain (50 lbs); gurd; muscle weakness and the list goes on and on!

Cleveland Clinic is somewhat nearby but whenever I tell my story no one seems to believe me or have any answers. It gets more exhausting and depressing with any new visit.

Lisinopril+hypertension,So I wanted to update everyone on the latest! I went to see the nephrologist today; and he is sending me to IU hospital in Indianapolis for surgery! I have an appointment on the 31st of this month to consult with the surgeon. Her name is Judiann Miskulin. From what I can find on her; she is a critical care surgeon who specializes in Endocrinology. The Dr. was shocked that nothing had been scheduled yet; and said "your tumor is HUGE" and it has to come out! After leaving there I felt so nervous about it all; because I feel like I still dont' have a diagnosis; and I am being thrown into surgery. I just don't know what to expect from here; and this makes me very uncomfortable. The endo that my heart Dr. referred me to scheduled me for March 24; and I was able to find another endo who was willing to see me on Feb 9th; but then today I went to this Dr. whom my primary Dr. referred me to; and he already has me seeing a surgeon in INDY. I am just like really scared. Should they just jump into surgery like this without knowing if the tumor is secreting or not?,2009,2011,,Female
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi everyone ... has anyone out there experienced 24/7 dizziness from there anxiety ?

Over the past two years; I've had numerous episodes where my body takes involuntary deep breaths; one every 7-8 minutes; interspersed with my normal breathing. The intake of breath can be when inhaling or exhaling; and it when it occurs; it disrupts a normal breath. Often the involuntary breath feels "catchy" as if I'd been crying or sobbing when in fact I have not.

Lisinopril+hypertension,Shamefully; for almost 8 years I have been getting very small itchy blisters on various spots on my arms and legs. The small blisters develop and immediately itch intensely; which is how I know they're there. They have a clear fluid inside; with no puss. When I scratch them in my sleep or when they break; they often weep a little amber colored liquid. Also; when I scratch them; more tiny blisters will develop around the original blister; signifying an infection. These broken blisters often leave (little open sores) which can be difficult and slow to heal. These outbreaks seem to come in waves; as I'll often go weeks or even a month or two without a sign of blisters; itching; or infection. I have never had any white puss or swelling redness around these troublesome blisters/vesicles; which isn't like any normal skin infection I've ever had before. Can anyone help me diagnosis this problem please?,2008,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am 25 & am on Prednisone(60mg);salasapyrin(500mg)& Plaquenil(200mg) per day. I have developed a large moon shaped face. I am swollen in the face & neck & hate what it is doing to my face. Will this swelling & fluid go away when I come off the steroids in five weeks? It is causing me to be depressed & family have noticed the change in my face & are worried for my health. I have heard some scary things about these drugs; prednisone in particular. Please is there anything that can stop the Moon face & would I benefit from taking a dieretic too?? P.s I have had an eye twitch every day for the last 3 dys in my left eye; lasting for approx 20secs & about every 10 mins? Could this b another side effect & should I worry about it as it is annoying & starting to get sore? Thanks,2006,2006,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Not sure where to post this. A few days ago I had a sensation of the floor vibrating under one foot. Since then I have realized it is my foot. It is felt in bloth feet; one at a time. Never both at the same time. I feel it when I am standing r walking. It is like an intermittent buzzing sensation. It comes in short bursts on after the other then stops. It will happen when walking and I will feel it with every third or fourth step. What could be the cause? I am taking no medications; only slightly over weight and am a 47 yr. old female in good health. This discussion is related to faint vibration or 'humming' sensation.,2007,2008,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,In May I began to have dizzy spells which coincided with a sore throat and earache; which cleared up on their own. However; dizziness and fatigue continued for several weeks. The dizziness resembled being carsick; with lightheadedness and occasional moments of nausea and feeling faint (but I never passed out). I had a CAT scan and blood work twice; and so far no diagnosis for the dizziness/fatigue. It got better for a few weeks but last week I began to have dizzy spells again; this time accompanied by maxillary sinus pressure. I had just switched allergy medications; from Nasonex to generic Flonase; right at the time my symptoms returned. Could allergies have led to a sinus infection? Can the sinus infection cause dizziness and fatigue? Due to the holiday weekend I haven't been able to call my doctor; but after 3 prior visits he's never suggested sinuses to be a cause.,2006,2006,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,I saw another post about atrial fibrillation and stomach gas possible association or connection. I too have the same thing so it may not be all in your head if your suspect this to be the case. Most dr.'s think your crazy or never heard of this when you even suggest it. Thats whats wrong with most dr's atleast in my experience in that they don't think outside the box enough possibly because this is what they learned. I think I/we can guess or prognose just as well or better than they can at times particularly if we know something about health and or ourselves and our own health. Never be afraid to speak up because I feel strongly that digestive tract problems are real and translate into other real nasty symptoms like this. Fortunately we can prevent much of this & need to prevent it from happening. I do feel the more you get afib the worse it can become either physically; emmotionally or both no matter what the cause. I thought up until now that I may have been the first to discover this but would like to know if anyone else has any real answers to this as being a connection? I would like to know how many people feel that they get atrial fibrillation and feel that it may be related to gas or full; bloated stomach; intestinal or digestive tract troubles etc? Isn't it possible that the gas; bloat; perhaps inflamed digestive or intestinal tract can disturb the vagus nerve thereby possibly causing you to go into an afib attack? Any real dr's out there any more with some real info about this? Even conjecture? Any way I also would be interested in what anyone might have to say about it and or what they may have learned from this? If you know or even think this to be the case for you I would also like to correspond with you to trade stories and info on what you''ve learned and done. Be well. Sincerely; Rich - delcocat at aol *******,2009,2009,,
Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello. Yesterday my doctor suggested I might have Laryngeal Spasms; and while I wait 2 months for the Throat specialist to get my appointment; she suggested I look online. But my symptoms don't seem to match all of yours...no voice problems or 'breathing' problems. I just get these violent coughing attacks that literally feel and behave as if I inhaled a bread crumb; and my body suddenly and violently is trying to cough it up. And just like when we are choking; I have a hard time catching my breath during these violent choking fits. By the time I'm done 4-8 minutes later; I'm shaking; tears streaming down my face; and I've probably wet myself. Its horrible! Does this sound familiar to anyone? Oh; and this happens at all hours of the day and night; and usually; its not when I'm eating. Its frightening to wake up from a deep sleep choking like this. She suggested curbing any reflux I might be having; but I rarely ever have heartburn (but I'll try anything now!) I do note that it happens more often when my respiratory system is weakened by a cold; or allergy season; or even a little cough. I'm thinking she might be in the right ballpark; but not the right diagnosis. Thanks for your help.,2008,2008,,

Lisinopril+hypertension,I was really hoping for a suggestion as to why I may have developed an indentation in the top of my head. At first I thought I was crazy; and that it was impossible for that to happen; but over the last few months it seems to have grown and now anyone who feels the top of my head can easily feel it. It scares me; especially since my husband had brain surgery less than 2 years ago- (symptoms completely different of course) I am 35 years old; the only time I remember hitting my head really hard is when I was in elementary school and I fell and hit my head on a tile floor. I have had a history of passing out and having seizures but the doctors never figured out for sure what caused it and it hasn't happened for a few years. The best they came up with was blood sugar; and dehydration as a cause for those episodes; although I never had a MRI or anything of my head. I don't get pains from it; it may be a little tender if I press on the indent kind of hard. Is there any condition that would cause my skull to cave in? please help!,2008,2008,,

Nadolol+hypertension,I've been researching all week. Nadolol has me dizzy; slowing me down. I have been arguing w/ Dr. about when I can reduce. Bandings are going well. Next one in August. I'm terrified of bleeding out again. That ER and ICU situation made a huge impact on me. I worked out some; and then reading about rebleeds slowed me down again. Triple digit heat index reminds me to be patient and stay inside. Yoga is great; but I wanna walk or ride my bike. I know we all deal w/ the fear. It's hard to calm your mind w/ meds; lack of exercise; and statistics that shed light on a harsh reality. Bottom line: I don't like not having control. I thought I would get it back after tx. Do you all find that the mental game is almost as hard as the physical one? My hgb is 12.1. It's going up on it's own since finishing tx. Platelets are 61 which is 1/2 of pre tx. ALT/AST and absolute are good as is albumin. My one kidney keeps plugging away and all functions are fine. So I guess that sums it up. Numbers are getting better. I have to adjust to living with Nadolol and threat of varices bleeds. I supposed to keep pulse between 60-80. Sigh. Thanks for listening and feedback. I didn't feel so much at home at hep c forum once I finished tx. Not the people; just that the frequent posters could not all identify w/ my concerns. Hopefully others who are hit with the reality of living with cirhossis (especially hep c post tx) will find their way here. We still need support. Peace out; Karen :),2011,2012,54,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues. Thanks a lot; all the best; Leonel,2007,2008,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Yes; I'm still alive. Dr. banded 5 more varices the day after school was out. He wants to band 4 or 5 more times at the rate of once a month. It is wearing me out with a 10 day recovery due to esophageal spasm pain plus the liquid or soft diet. This was supposed to be my recovery from tx. wah wah wah. BUT! I'm UND and alive. That's a good thing. I've heard bleed outs will haunt you. True. They took my Nadolol to 60 mg daily. Zones me out; but will reduce liver portal valve pressure. Have others gone brain foggy on it? Will it level out? I've read many of your recent posts. So proud of everyone for hanging in there. I'll say it again: the triple therapy was the pits; but my liver functions are normalizing and I'd start again tomorrow if needed. I wanted time to rest from tx after school was out. I'm dealing w/ anger about varices. But I've heard it can be a real life saver with NO future bleedouts for some. I logged on to look up past posts. I'm on a real computer and am gonna search.

Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; this is my first time posting. I am so confused; angry; tired and in so much pain. First of all; I have portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis. I don't drink AT ALL; even though in Alaska everyone thinks you do if you have liver disease. I have GERD and no mater what I eat; it seems to stay in my stomach forever; until the pain is overwhelming. But a CT scan showed "nothing" out of he ordinary. My gastro put me on a course of prednisone before a colonoscopy with disastrous results. My diabetes went nuts; my blood sugar was over 500; my vision was shot and my hands and feet swelled like balloons. I was given insulin injections but my sugars stayed high. The doctor didn't seem overly concerned. I finally flushed the prednisone down the toilet and refused to take it. I have osteoarthritis and can barely walk because of my knees. The doctor finally gave me a painkiller; but it is oxycodone WITHOUT Tylenol because of my liver issues. Well; it says plainly on my charts that I am allergic to codeine! All he said was that it was synthetic codeine. And he won't give me anything else and said to take Advil. At this point I don't know what I should be concentrating on. Weight loss is hampered by other medicatons and I don't eat very much at all. My blood pressure is very good and my A1C is at 6. I am trying to take control of my diabetes again. But I am bloated; swollen; fighting yeast infections and torn ligaments in my knees. I don't know what to do anymore. Would supplements help? Which ones? There aren't a lot of choices for doctors in Alaska. Thanks so much!!,2009,2009,57,Female

Thank you ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dear H.Cooper Your symptoms could be due to side effects of either the nadolol or the clonidine. As you point out; beta blockers can make breathing more difficult in people with underlying lung disease. Either clonidine or nadolol can cause a feeling of fatigue. There are several other potential medications for high blood pressure that you could take. However; neither nadolol nor clonidine should be stopped abruptly - it can be dangerous to do so. Therefore; check with your doctor to see if you can be switched to other medications. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to write back.

My doctor didn't give this treatment plan much credence and she put me on Nadolol only. Are doctors prescribing these two meds and are they effective in the prevention of rebleeding. ____ Dear Lee; Thank you for your question regarding the medical treatment of esophageal varices. Beta blockers; of which nadolol is an example; have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of initial variceal bleeding. These drugs reduce cardiac output and therefore the quanity of blood in the portal circulation. There is evidence that nitrates also reduce portal pressure; by a different mechanism than nadolol. Nitrates act to dilate the mesenteric vessels; lowering the portal pressure. Is the combination more effective than either drug alone? In theory; the combination should be more effective than either drug alone but there is not a lot of published material. Animal studies have shown that nitroglycerin and propranolol (another type of beta blocker) had a greater effect on portal pressure than either drug alone. A human study was published in 1993. This study compared the long term effects of propranolol alone with propranolol combined with a nitrate. The combination lowered the portal pressure to a greater degree than propranolol alone. The combination therapy did not adversely affect renal function although ascites did become worse. This exacerbation of ascites limits enthusiasm for the recommendation of this therapy for all patients with esophageal varices. There is a study that showed the combination of nadolol and isosorbide nitrate was more effective than sclerotherapy. Further work is required to confirm the long term safety and efficacy. This response is being provided for general informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice or consultation.

Nadolol+hypertension,I have recently had an episode of increasing headaches after my neurologist felt it was safe to decrease my diamox by 500mg/month to discontinuation (i had decreased to 500mg BID from 500mg QID). My LP opening pressure at the time of this decision was 21. The increased headaches caused 6 days and nights of absolutely no sleep no matter what I tried (i tried hot baths; relaxing CD's; music; ativan (1-4mg); gravol; benadryl and combinations thereof....all methods that normally work very well on their own). My family physician; concerned; sent me for a neuro consult at the emerg here in town where they did a CT (normal) and an LP...opening pressure varied between 26-21....now it took them 6 tries (junior resident) and I am wondering if it might just not have been an accurate reading? Since then I have experienced an increase in my headaches once again (they had just started to be controlled with nadolol...but i had no rescue med that worked) and am now experiencing what i think must be pulsatile tinnitus (like wind going through my ears two or three times in a row; and a low ring every so often). Could I still be having this many symptoms from my IIH even if their final reading was correct and my pressure was only 21?,2009,2010,,

Nadolol+hypertension,I am a pretty healthy 24 year old male who has gone through a bunch of testing for different reasons over the course of 7 years. It came out that i have POTs and the treatment was 40mgs of nadolol and i was on it for a year and half and basically all my tachycardia is gone and i am no longer on the medication. I never had most of the issues that follow pots i just had some lightheaded or dizziness with tachycardia. ( weeks ago i woke up feeling dizzy and lightheaded i figured it was the change of the weather and didn't think much of it. The feelings continued and i went to my internist at NYU which told me my blood pressure and EKG was fine that my heart rate was in the mid 50sand all my blood was normal. I made a follow up appointment with my EP at Columbia which did a stress test and echo about 6 months ago which was normal no issues. That was wen all was well and i didn't have symptoms. He told me with my recent testing that my office EKG was fine he never heard me sound so good.He ordered a 24 hour holter which he said came back absolutely normal the reading where 45bpm during sleep with mostly 70bpm on average going up to 140bmp during the course of the day. I had no pauses or arrhythmia's. I sent me to the neurologist due to the feelings i was getting was like my body was shutting down and my head felt like it was floating. My arms and legs would get like jello and weak and i just felt like i was in slow motion walking around. I started getting a bloated feeling in my upper stomach that would go into my chest and cause chest pressure and fullness. I have had chest X-ray and mdi of brain and cervical spine all came back normal. I was just wondering if the is could all be related to Pulmonary Hypertension or signs of it since i am starting to get short of breath tacky since i have been off my meds and chest pressure where it feels like I'm not getting enough air at times where it will go away within a hour or so,2014,2014,24,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,I have been on nadolol 40 mg for years. My blood pressure has gone down in the last year. I'm on trazodone and have lost almost 30 pounds due to cancer treatment. The doctor reduced my nadolol to 20 mg. a few months ago and recently discontinued it. Six days after stopping it; my legs swelled up. The doctor saw me and I was up 7 lbs from the previous week. He thinks it's a reaction to going of the nadolol or perhaps the tamoxifen (discontinued 1 month ago). The pharmacist didn't agree. I'm also experiencing heart pounding (had this somewhat before this) and my pulse is up. My pulse has been 96 beat per minute at rest. During my workout; where it's usually 108; it is now 156. I was down 30 pounds before and tried to stop the nadolol and my heart rate went up as well. Should I be concerned about this? I feel maybe the trazodone is the thing that has caused my b.p. to drop; not the weight loss. I've had hypertension since age 24.,2007,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,I just went through and completed 12 weeks of harvoni to cure hep c. I had to have 3 bands put on non-bleeding varices in esophagus. How to slowly decrease dosage of carvedilol used to stop/prevent more esophageal varices? I took 6.25 tablet twice a day for 10 days and heart bpm was really low at 39. My uppuer cheekbones swollen (eyes appear sunken); so I then reduced dosage to 5 mg twice a day for 8 days BUT HEART RATE is STILL 39 bpm. Yesterday I again reduced dosage to 3.125 mg twice a day. They want my heart rate to be around 60 bpm as the goal. QUESTION: 1. Is my dosage decrease plan safe enough (slow enough) to prevent danger from too quick of a withdrawl? 2. If this were you ; would you do somthing differently? 3. Do you have any other ideas or hypothetical suggestion? Thank you so much for your time :),2015,2015,,Female

Nadolol+hypertension,HI! I have been on Verapamil; and gained weight from that. I was also on nadolol; but the heartbeat was still forceful. I asked to go on atenolol (10 mg in the AM and PM) since it helped my mom for the same thing. It is very noticeable and i have a hard time sleeping from this! I recently went to a health and nutrition store...as I read the good effects of Hawthorne Berry on the heart.. I took that; but not at the same time as atenolol. My heartbeat is worse then ever and sooooo strong and uncomfortable! I won't go off the heart meds until I can slowly cut down. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I should do? No insurance becasue of layoffs; so this is hard. Heart tests as of last fall (2008) were normal. THANKYOU!,2009,2009,53,Female

Nadolol+hypertension,My dad was recently diagnosed with severe Cirrhosis of the liver. He is 63 and was never a heavy drinker. We think it may have been caused by metformin he took to treat Diabetes. He also has been self employed and has no insurance; so at this time he is not a candidate for a transplant. He stays cold all of the time and has no energy; yet he is still trying to work due to being denied for disability. He also has an enlarged spleen and very low blood counts and the doctors do not seem to be concerned. The only medicine that he has been prescribed is nadolol. We are not sure what to do for him. He stays so weak. Is there anyone that can give us some advice on medication that we need to request to improve his quality of life? I am a daddy's girl and need him here for a lot longer. Any information would be greatly appreciated.,2015,2015,29,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,I got cirrhosis from having Hep C . Doctors say I have had it a long time even though there were no symtoms and I had a yearly wellness check up. I had an ultrasound done last year at my request. Results were normal but not now. I know that you can vomit blood and why but have not had this happen yet. This morning I saw light red when I spit before I started to brush my teeth. Gone after brushing teeth. Will I actually vomit blood or will I just see something like this morning? And do you feel sick? In other words; will I have any doubt about what is going on? Before if I saw this I would just assume it was from brushing my teeth too hard.,2014,2014,,Female

Nadolol+hypertension,Hi there. I would just like to ask a few questions or to perhaps receive some advice about my daily migraines that I have been getting now for 3 months. I am currently on 80 mg of Nadolol as a preventative and although it has definitely decreased the intensity of my migraines the frequency continues to be anywhere between 1-3 a day. They are mild-moderate in pain level; but the pain has really never been the issue for me as much as the other neurological symptoms. I get extreme nausea; vertigo; ear stuffiness; scalp pain; and light/noise sensitivity which i find more debilitating and difficult to live with. I am currently under the care of an excellent doctor at a pain clinic and i do feel like we are making progress; but i can't seem to decrease the frequency of them. I have had a CT scan (normal) and go next week for an MRI. I also take Axert when I can (it makes me sleepy so i usually can only take when I am home). I have also started a pretty intensive regiment of vitamins (vit D; magnesium; calcium) and have recently started 5 HTP (stimulated production of seretonin i believe). All in all I feel like we are trying a number of different possibilities; but I can't understand why i keep getting them several times sometimes per day. I have also eliminated a number of things from my diet; such as aspartame; msg; nuts; etc as well as reduced my caffeine intake. I see an osteopath and acupuncturist. Anyways; just wondering if there was anything we are overlooking or anything you could add to help us? just of note; my dr is reluctant to increase the nadolol because i did have some side effects even at this dose (although ok now) such as low heart rate; low bp; etc. This may not be relevant; but i am a 39 year old female raising three children (with a great husband) and a professional who owns her own business. i have been working on reducing my stress as well. I appreciate any input that you may have. Thanks in advance.,2010,2010,38,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi first I want to say thank you for your time the help that the doctors provide on here in invaluable. I am 26 and have been having IST along with headaches pain kind of where my gallbladder used to be but a little more towrd the center of the top of my stomach and wierd brown spots that are showing up pn my arms and chest and even legs biggest being about the size of an eraser. My heart rate went up the day the pain started and has not come down. without a beta blocker it is around 90's sitting the second I put my feet down to stand up it goes to to the 120+ comes down and goes up with minimal work. I know these are symptoms of IST but I wanted to see if you think this could be a pheo. I know they are very rare but do happen. if it was just the heart rate I wouldnt question it but with the head aches that I never got before and the pain the blood pressure going up even on the beta blocker over heating and the new cafe au lait spots could this be a pheo or only IST what else should I be tested for it they think it is IST... I have also had some nausea but not horrible. I know about Pots as well. I am having a ttt to determine which one I have and a 24 hour urine; should I also have the blood tested aswell? thank you for any info.,2006,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,My wife had 2 bleedings (2007 and 2009) due to cirrhosis of the liver. In Feb this yesr her Platel count was 85 and last week it was 87. Her other troubles are; that her right ankle is swollen in the evening ( water) and from her foot up to the knee she has burning pain. She said it feels like it's on fire and she also has abdominal pain that comes and goes. What concerns should she/we have or what can be done about her condition? Saw the doc yesterday and he said he will look into her low platel count; but didn't seemed interested in her other problems. She also had 2 nose bleeds within the last 2 weeks; which came on just sudden. Current medications she is taking are: Nadolol; Spirolactone; Furosemide; Folic Acid; B1; Multi-Vitamin and Prilosec. She also takes Glyburide for her Type 2 Diabetes. Thanks for any info,2010,2010,44,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,I had esophageal varices that they found after going to the hospital vomiting blood. I had been going to a GI doc for a couple of years with stomach cramps and diarrhea and I was told he could not find anything wrong with me. Before the bleed; I had been suffering from fatigue and sometimes I found it hard to keep my eyes open; I mentioned this to my regular doc(actually NP) and I would get talked about my sugar levels and my weight; I had been hardly eating and yet my sugar was around 200-230 all the time. Well; I didn't have my regular doc and the doc on call did a surgical endoscopy and found varices in my esophagus. So she banded them and set up a follow up appt with my regular GI doc. I go to him and he could not tell me why I had them. He did say that the only way he would know was to do a liver biopsy; this was on 9/25. He set up another endoscopy for 12/11. I kept getting sick; and I even developed a intestinal bacterial infection from the hospital. Colds and everything. He was sending me for all kinds of xrays; ultrasound; CT scans; and blood work. On a follow-up visit I was told I had Cirrhosis of the Liver and I had been diagnosed with a Fatty Liver in 1/08. The varices were caused by high portal vein hypertension and I never had high blood pressure before and when I was discarged from the hospital I was taken off the Metrolprolol(for arrythmia) and put on Nadolol. Also Sucralfate and Protonix. Before I had the endoscopy on 12/11 he made a remark that he didn't think I had esophageal varices; which I thought was very odd. Afterwards he told me I had another bleed and he rebanded all the varices from the previous endoscopy. So I did have them. In my follow-up visit of 12/21 he told me that I had to have another endoscopy on 1/8 and scheduled a liver biopsy; finally. After the 1/8 endoscopy he said I had yet another bleed and had to have another one in 4-6 weeks. He did tell me from the blood tests that it looks like I have Autoimmune Hepatitis. Does it usually take this long to have docs to do all of these? It seems that I have a hard time telling him what is my symptoms; like he doesn't want to hear what I say. Should I get another Doctor? There isn't much of a choice where I come from; only two practices of GI docs. HELP,2012,2013,59,Female

It was pretty bad; close to bursting but were extremely fortunate that they were able to catch it in time before they started to bleed. He will go back I'm the next few months to have the same procedure done again several times. We went to his regular dr appt yesterday to talk about our options in treating hep c again. Dr wants to hold off before starting treatment again until we get the EDG procedures taken care off; also he wants to wait and see what new treatments will be available.,2012,2013,22,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi - I'm wondering if someone can take a look at my last ultrasound report and help me understand if this is indicative of cirrhosis? ..i have been on the transplant list (for 2 years) and hoping my liver is beginning to heal due to lifestyle changes and ongoing support. Thanks - susie ** FINDINGS **: The overall echogenicity of the liver is diffusely increased and mildly coarse. The liver is slightly nodular in contour. The liver is normal in size without evidence of suspicious solid focal abnormality. Hepatopetal flow is demonstrated within main portal veins. There is no evidence for intra or extra hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct measures 7 mm. There is no evidence of ascites. The remainder of the abdomen and pelvis were not evaluated. ** IMPRESSION **: No sonographic sign of hepatoma. (My dr. sent me an email stating the report "looked good" but I am more interested in the state or status of my liver and are these findings congruent with a diagnosis of cirrhosis? ),2015,2015,,Female

Nadolol+hypertension,My husband was diagnosed with cirrhosis in July by liver biopsy. He had been followed with ultrasounds and bloodwork after a surgeon who performed a hernia surgery found an enlarged portal vein last November. The ultrasounds showed a slightly enlarged liver and spleen but no nodules etc. He did have elevated LFTs and low platelets in his bloodwork. He had been a heavy drinker but the cirrhosis was also caused by fatty liver. In the last year he has purposely lost 51 lbs. He eats very healthy now; stopped drinking; is very active and works full time. His MELD score was 15 originally and dropped to 13 in a 3 month period. On Halloween this year; he was admitted to his transplant hospital with bleeding esophageal varices. They were grade 1-2 found on endoscopy after his diagnosis. He had the banding done and is now on meds to decrease portal pressure. His MD said hes not appropriate for the transplant list. Prior to this episode he was diagnosed with compensated mild cirrhosis. His child - Pugh score places him in class a. Since the bleeding; I have been reading that technically he has decompensated cirrhosis. I am a health care professional myself and I'm so scared for his continued health. He doesn't even appear sick. The MD said the cirrhosis was caught early. It's confusing because if it's early then why did he get these bleeding varices that indicate end stage disease? His LFTS are all within the normal ranges now; platelets are 113-123;000 up from 60000; and his bilirubin continues to improve as well. He appears to be compensated based on his bloodwork but not on the bleeding varices. I'm petrified that he's going to need a transplant in the future. Any advice is greatly appreciated,2014,2014,,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; my name is Susan; I have been the caregiver for my husband who on April 3rd; 2013 presented to the emergency room with mysenteric venous thrombosis with all 3 pathways blocked; mysenteric ischemia; gastric and esophageal varices; alcohol related cirrhosis and portal hypertension. A month prior to this we were living in bliss with no idea of what was to come - no real health problems existed. He was hospitalized for 2 weeks then sent home on Lovenox and told to follow-up with a GI. After being home for 2 days he started having severe abdominal pain and we rushed back to the hospital - they found additional clots - this time in a different circulatory system causing kidney damage in 1 kidney but the other was not damaged but did have clots. He was again hospitalized for 2 weeks and dishcarged on lovenox. Eventually Coummadin was started and within a couple of weeks he started profusely vomitting blood; he was lifeflighted to the hospital where they added Nadolol - said his bleeding was not related to varices but that his portal hypertension had caused the stomach lining to bleed. They took him off all blood thinners and within 2 months returned to the hospital with excruciating abdominal pain - mysenteric venous thrombosis had returned - this time only 2 were blocked. Sent home on Lovenox and Nadolol - this time they added high levels of pain medications to take on a regular basis. My husband and I are both in recovery and have been so for almost 20 years - he has not had a drink this entire time. The pain medications seemed necessary but concerning. Approximately a month later he started throwing up again - back to emergency room - they did a scan and said he had gallstones. They did an ERCP and could find no gallstones? Eventually he stabilized and was sent home - on MORE pain medications. 2-3 days later he started spiking a fever (102-103) - back to Houston Medical Center branch this time - started on multiple antibiotics; had numerous teams yet no one could determine source of infection - thought to be related to the ERCP. Developed hiccups that lasted about 1 month; had 3 spots on his liver; liver biopsy done - no cancer detected but found granulomas; discharged home and by now have too many pain medications. Have a hepatologist and was orginally told that "Absolutely - I can tell you what is going on and give you a plan of action - shame on those doctors that haven't give you a plan of action." By the end of the last hospitalization he's scratching his head and saying how unusual his case is an he just doesn't know what is causing all the problems. Was originally told transplant but then was informed that his liver enzymes are still functioning well at times to prevent us from being placed on liver transplant list and they just don't know why he is hurting so much - they refer us to a pain management center. By this point I am beyond frustrated - friend suggested Mayo Clinic in Minnesota can figure out everything - so here we are and the first thing they do is put bands on his esophageal varices - good but I could have gotten that done in Texas. Since being banded he has been hospitalized x 2 for uncontrolled vomitting - he is unable to take the pain medications that everyone has precribed him and now is going into withdrawals. What do they do - add an additional "Break Through" pain medication and send him home. I have been told that abdominal pain is a mystery and that he will always have to be on extremely high doses of pain medications - no treatment - no cure. REALLY - can that possibly be true? I'm desperate; tired and extremely frustrated. We are due to go back home tomorrow night - I have 2 children at home that want their daddy back! Can anyone help us?????,2014,2014,,Male

What does anyone think about having an invasive test just to check for varices? I am under the impression there isn't anything other than watchful waiting even if they are seen. I am leading towards not having the test at this time and only going for a week 48 ultrasound since my only ultrasound was at biopsy. Thanks for any info and all other info in the past.,2003,2004,,
Nadolol+hypertension,My Doc thinks I should treat again. First time I had a very easy time not a lot of side affects. The worst part as a lot of us know is clearing the virus and after the 6mo wait time to hear the virus is back.The depression hit me again like a ton of bricks. This time I will treat for 72 weeks we all know thats a lot of weeks. So here is my ? to you all. How many have treated more than once? How many cleared the virus the second time around? How many are waiting for the next new miracle drug to come out in 2010? I guess this is my own little impromptu survey I'm just curious. To treat to wait what if Ya wait to long. I have had the virus for over 30 years and have portal hypertensoin. Biopys show no (and I love this line) obvious cirrhosis but it's there. TO: Bill54 I read in another post that you are taking a lot of pills can I ask what they are for? Hope it's ok to ask you have been very forthcoming in all your posts. Also want to Thank everyone who has answered my post. The information and knowledge on this web site is a God Send Thank you !!!!! Hopeful51,2008,2008,,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,My husband underwent the Interferon/Riba treatment about a year ago and it didn't work. After that; he was put on a trial and six months later they took him off of it because it didn't work again. He is stage 4 now and I am petrified. I can't sleep; I can't eat; I'm anxious; and I am so scared. From everything that I read; there's not much time left at stage 4. I don't know if I'm strong enough to just sit here and just watch him die. Someone please tell me what happens now. Will he suffer? How much time does he truly have? I can't stop crying. I don't want to live without him. Please talk to me.,2010,2010,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi folks; was wondering; is an endoscopy considered "routine maintenance" with active HCV? Is it usually recommended to be done on a regular basis? I was under the impression that varices were a concern only in situations of portal hypertension. Would a doctor recommend endoscopy in the absence of portal hypertension? (My husband who has HCV is questioning how necessary this test is.) Or; is it just routine course of "clearing to start treatment" kind of test? For those are starting/started/had treatment; was this part of pre-treatment work-up? Thanks for any input.,2008,2008,,Female

Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at?

Nadolol+hypertension,My mom was diagnoised with cirrhosis of the liver last June; Now; over the last month she has been declining with impaired sleep deprivation for days; impaired thinking; slurred speach; high ammonia levels for her (183) Mar. 19 labs were normal. Today she said that her legs wouldn't work. When diagnosised she had portal hypertension; esophageal varicies and came home with chronic . She is now in a nursing home because she needs more care. Is this an indication that her liver is completely failing. Do I need to have her in the hospital for antibiotic treatments; she has started the lactulose. I am a nurse and my heart is telling me that my mom may not be with me very long. I need to know what I can do and be on top of her plan of care to make the staff and keep the md on top of her treatment. I want her as comfortable as possible. Should I opt for Hospice care for her instead of nursing home. This is gut wrenching watching this horrible disease take my mom away from me. Will this get worse or are there treatments that can help her stablize? I welcome any information you may have or suggest to enable me to care for her the best I can. Thank you. This discussion is related to Ammonia level.,2009,2009,,
Nadolol+hypertension,I was put on hctz 12.5 mg around 2006; but knowing I have severe "white coat syndrome"; I never took it until I tore some muscles in my upper back and the Dr. insisted I start the med. in May of 07. I have a B/P monitor which checks out against the ones at the Dr.s office; so I was pretty sure my home readings were accurate and they were OK. I was in a great deal of pain from my back injury and PT was making it worse. My personal trainer suggested a med that had helped with a back problem; and my physician sent in a perscription for it. After one dose; I ended up in the ER in the middle of the night with outrageously high B/P. They got that fixed; but it went way up again the next day and I saw another MD who immediately put me on 12.5 mg Atenolol. That was in July of 07. I am 5'2" tall; weigh 116# and have no cholesterol problems or any other (known) medical problems that simple blood tests would uncover. While on Atenolol I got very out of breath on my daily walks and ; being a SCUBA diver; I had a very scary out of breath episode under water that made me decide to try to get off the Beta blocker. My current MD had me take my regular dose every other day for a week and then stop. The first week after stopping; my energy level was off the charts; but this past week there has been a lot of heart-pounding; rapid heartbeats; soaring B/P from time to time; a rushing sound in my ears that makes me think my B/P is way up and my fears just make it much worse. She said I might have to double up on the hctz if there was a Beta blocker backlash; but I really want to stop those; too. Is there any hope for that and is there anything I can do to help myself through this? I don't smoke; I seldom drink and never more than 1 glass of red wine or 1-2 beers. I exercise regularly; and have cut salt out of my life as much as possible and take vitamins regularly along with cutting out red meat. There is a strong family history of heart problems which none of my Dr's seem to address - most don't even get up from the computer to listen to my heart. I am going on a dive trip in March and I don't want to feel this rotten while out of the country. A little advise would be much appreciated. By the way; I am a 69 yr.old female. Thank you.,2008,2008,69,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Hepatologist suggested my doctor put me on something to control Esophageal Varices; which after a test; were discovered in me. The severity is said to be medium. I've don’t some reading with contradicting beliefs from various doctors and clinical trials. However; all doctors seem to agree that a beta blocker like Atenolol is necessary for a long term use. Just want to know if any of you are on this treatment at 25mg per day. I understand there are some risks; but that the result of lowering blood pressure and heartbeats can help reduce the development of a more serious Varices problem; which in some cases can cause death form unstoppable internal bleeding. Anyone? Thanks; Magnum,2001,2008,61,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 30 year old Type 2 diabetic who was diagonised with NASH and Gilbert's syndrome some 8 years back. A liver biopsy at that time had confirmed the same. I have been living very cautiously since then with hardly any high-calorie intake. Some 3 years back I also developed a gallstone which has been asymptomatic till now. A week back I had been to a gastroenterologist to discuss about the gallstone and if surgical opinion needs to be taken given that it is completely asymptomatic as I am travelling abroad in some days. The doc adcised me to get a fibroscan just for the sake of it because I had been diagonised with NASH & fatty liver. The results of the Fibroscan gave me the shock of my life- the results came up with a 35kpa stiffness. I get my LFT and CBC done regularly and there are no major issues(except for very slightly raised SGPT/SGOT levels- around 10-15 points above normal lvls). I also have no symptoms whatsoever (perfectly reasonable level of energy; good apetite etc). I was advised an endoscopy which I couldnt pursue because of the lack of time but I am extremely scared now because of this. Some guidance on this would be highly appreciated. Many Thanks . .,2014,2014,28,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm dealing with tachycardia arrhytmia since more than 2 years now. My Cardilogist at first said it was dysautonomia and POTS and blame also my severe anxiety and was put on a beta blocker; propranolol 20 mg day. At first it was working on to stop the tachycardia but with time the effect wear off and had to increase my dose and then it was lowering too much my blood pressure so my Cardiologist switch me on another beta blocker... I try several ones; bisoprolol; nadolol; timolol; pindolol; acebutolol... All of those fails to control the tachycardia. In those 2 years; I start having more and more heart related symptoms. Chest pain; jaw pain; left arm pain; exercise intolerance; dizziness; vertigo; intestine problems; low energy physically and mentally... I have severe anxiety (panic with agoraphobia; somatisation; GAD; social anxiety). My anxiety is not well control; I'm med sensitive and can't take antidepressants like Paxil; Lexapro or even older ones like imipramine... 1 mg of Paxil send me to the ER and same for Lexapro; didn't had problem with both drugs before and took them for my anxiety for years. I'm on a high dose of clonazepam 7 mg day; I'm addicted and do a very slow tapering withdrawal... Will take years to get off the clonazepam. I also deal with many panic attacks every day; can't get out th house; can't stay alone; everything trigger heart related symptoms like tachycardia or chest pain; a loud sound; music; too much people's around me... My nervous system seem to be overactive... I'm always sick; have chronic headache; heart is pounding in my chest all the time even when my heart rate is normal; droop of blood pressure or high blood pressure; feeling very hot all the time but can't sweat; can't exercise or just walk cause of my low energy and no physical endurance... I saw my Cardiogist 2 weeks ago; he look at my last holter monitor results and said it was anxiety and said that I may have dysautonomia but probably cause of the anxiety... I was stable on 10 mg x 3 of propranolol day for the last 7 months but the tachycardia was not under control at all... He suggest to RX 25 mg x 2 day of metoprolol. I start taking the metoprolol 2 weeks ago. I feel awful! Not only its not helping the tachycardia; but it make my anxiety worse. I have a migraine with throbbing pain in my head since I start it 2 weeks ago. I have more chest pain and left arm and hand are numb most of the time. My jaw hurt and all my teeth also. I have insomnia; have some vision change; my energy level is even lower than on the propranolol. I also feel depression... The propranolol don't do that... I feel so awful that I decrease the dose to 12.5 mg every 12 hours insistead of 25 mg every 12 hours but even with a lower dose I feel very bad. I'm the only one here who have problems with the metoprolol or brand name lopressor? It's the immediate release one; not the XL... I call my Cardio Doc and ask to be put again on the Propranolol but he don't return my phone call back. The only one beta blocker that I never try is the bystolic; it's new in the Canada but too expensive for me. I also hear that for anxiety it's bad? Well share you're experiences with the metoprolol vs propranolol... It can't be all in my head; I mean the side effects from the metoprolol are horrible...,2013,2013,37,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,I just saw a new Hepatologist who suggested that I am most likely already in Stage 4; based solely on my platelet count. My last biopsy in 2006 showed Grade 3; stage 3. He has scheduled other tests; but in the meantime; be prescribed Xifaxan to control ammonia levels. Has anyone taken this drug; and if so; for how long? I understand that the FDA has only recently approved it for this use. SInce it is classified as an antibiotic; I don't understand how it can be used long term without harmful side effects. I'm sacred and freaking out a little bit about the cirrhosis diagnosis; and wonder if there's anything I should be doing differently with diet and supplements. I relapsed in 2009 after TX'ing for 66 weeks. Am currently waiting for a trial for relapsers with one of the PI's. Any help any of you could offer in the meantime would be greatly appreciated.,2009,2010,53,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,My sister has hht and cirrosis. She had a foot and a half of her intestines removed in Oct. becasue of uncontrollable bleeding. She was doing well and then fell and broke her femur. She is in a rehab facility but is scheduled to be released this week. She has had her abdomen drained twice in the past month. She looks scary. She lives in Fl. and I live in Tx. She does not want to move in with us. She is very bright and bounces between hopeful and positive and depressed. She is on lactalose and lasiks. Does anyone have any idea as to the time she has left? The doctor has said between 6 months and 2 yrs. That's a pretty big ballpark. Much thanks and love to all of you. This is so difficult.

Nadolol+hypertension,Hello; I was diagnosed with end stage cirrhosis back in March 2010. My last lab test revealed my platelet count is down to 60k. I have concerns since I read I could be heading for real trouble at around 20k. I have splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) which I think is directly responsible for the low platelet count. Any suggestions I would sure appreciate. Thx Randy,2010,2012,40,Male

Nadolol+hypertension,My hemoglobin is now down from 9.9 to 9.6; I was taken off the riba completely 10 days ago. My peg-interferon dose was reduced to the 1.35 line around the same time. I have advanced cirrhosis which has been pretty stable in recent years but now my old nemesis; ascites has returned and my legs and feet are swollen and belly quite distended. I've put on 12-14 lbs in the last 1.5 to 2 weeks; I'm certain it's all fluid retention. I am very concerned about this as I've had bleeding varices twice in the past and I was fortunate to survive. What has triggered the ascites? I haven't had that problem for a few years now. I know that anti-depressants can tweak the liver but I'm on a tiny; 5mg. dose of celexa. If the triple therapy is responsible; then at what cost am I eradicating the HCV; possible new and serious damage to my fibrous liver? In the past; I was told to double my dose of spironolactone; which worked but not quickly. I still remain undetected; but now I'm concerned with everything else. Trying to hang in there but ascites really scares me. I'm considering going to the ER today; as the gastro. clinic is closed on weekends; maybe I'm just having a panic attack.,2012,2012,,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,I have had PVC's for 15 years; last fall I started getting a block of PVC's maybe everyother beat for minutes. I have taken corgard or nadolol for years. This usually happens when I set down or lay down; and they leave with exercise. This seem to get progressavely worse with just this past month and even now I am wearing an event monitor the event monitor showed runs of PVC's and my Internal Med. Doctor put me on rythmol 225 extended release. I have looked at articles that it is best to live with PVC's than to take strong meds. was this a wise choice for me? I have been on rythmol for 7 days now and get a little dizzy when I first stand up and a little sluggish. I have had a stress test with pictures of my heart it was excellent; both the stress test and the pictures of my heart. When you look at form 1 to 20 PVC's pr minute that could be as high as 1200 PVC's each hour. Does rythmol seem the best direction now that my Dr. has rulled out other problems with tests; ekg; stress test with pictures; echo ekg or should I try to ignore the PVC's althoough I feel each one. What is your recommendation at this point?,2006,2006,,

Nadolol+hypertension,My friends; I know I brought this up before; but I have a cautionary tale regarding what I'm going through and what you should be aware of. I had an examination for Esophageal Verices about a year and a half ago. The Gastro banded one. A year ago; he repeated the examination and found none. So on I went with my life as I felt normal. My last ultrasound had a conclusion of "mildly Cirrhotic". This morning; I had another examination for Verices and sure enough; the Gastro found and banded three. He gave me a photo of the stomach where the verices were growing. What I mean by growing is that the blood vessel will start to form a balloon like visual abnormality in a section of the vein. If this balloon were to burst; especially while sleeping; internal bleeding can occur without you knowing it. This is very scary and could cause death. So in essence; I questioned the doctor today and asked if one does not have Cirrhosis but has Hepatitis C; can one get Esophageal Verices. He said yes. So please be warned. I'm very fortunate that my Gastro who has been treating me for nine years is always on top of this. Is yours? I would strongly recommend asking him even if you do not have Cirrhosis. The banding is done in a 20-30 minute procedure. The anesthetic used is Propofol. This drug is what supposedly caused Michael Jackson's death because he was given it steadily and not in a normal dosage for his sleep disorder. I had the opportunity to discuss this anesthetic (which looks like milk) and its propensity to cause toxicity to the liver. He replied that even though it is metabolized in the liver; the amount is nothing to worry about. I watched the anesthesiologist inject me with two large syringes of Propofol. I saw the firs one go in intravenously; but was knocked out before the second one was administered. The next thing I saw was an RN leaning over me in recovery. There is pain to be sure. some from gas; the rest from the banding. You cannot eat meat or bread for three days. I took two Oxycodone 7.5mg pain pills about an hour ago. The pain has been reduced by 50% and is acceptable. In conclusion; please ask your Gastro regarding this very important examination; of which many Heppies never think about. My Gastro is very proficient and always on guard. He also mentioned that in the latest study he read; Telaprevir has a 50% chance of clearing non-responders like myself. This is a much better percentage than the current 15-20% with traditional drugs. At any rate; I thought I would pass this important information along because the Gastro mentioned EVERYONE who has Hepatitis C should be checked for Verices every 6 months...

Before he started treatment he was banded 8 times first time 3 second time and none the third time. They said they would check it out every 6 months. My question is what does this all mean? Will they ever go away? Should we be pushing for a liver transplant soon?

Nadolol+hypertension,This is to jmjm530 or anyone else who might know. Jim I dont know if you remember me but I am Easywriter2222. I was on this website in the middle of 2005 when I started Hep C Treatments. My Dr wasn't so great and after about 3 or 4 months my viral load dropped but so did my platettes. 25000 so I had to stop stop taking treatment and went off everything and stopped checking anything. I just today got out of the hospital ICU for the last 9 days. The cause was esophigal varcies bleeding. I have an enlarged spleen and they are thinking I have developed cirossis of the Liver. I have never ever felt bad (medically speaking) from the Hep C nor have I ever had any pain or problems until last week when I vomited about 2 quarts of blood. What can you tell me?

Nadolol+hypertension,My husband has Cirrhosis and Hepatitis C. I am very concerned for him. He sees a Gastroenterologist but we are thinking about changing doctors. The Dr. is very vague and will not just come out right and tell us how bad off my husband is. My husband has had to have esophageal varices banding done twice. The first time he was an Alcoholic and almost bled to death. He was immediately banded. This 2nd time was a couple months ago and they went in to check the bands and banded off some more varices. He has been cleaned of alcohol and drugs for 4 years now; Praise God! My question is; when it comes to the point of esophageal banding; is your liver very bad off? We had to go see a surgeon today because he has gallstones. The surgeon will not take his gallbladder out because he has too high of a risk of bleeding. The surgeon mentioned a liver transplant; which his gastroenterologist has never mentioned. I am just very confused! Help!,2012,2012,,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,I've been on this forum for several years now under the name "HaveFaith4Me". Somehow it locked me out of my account so this is my new one. Yesterday my husband went in for another EGD; 6 more bands were placed. This makes a total of 17 bands that have been put in the last 4 months. I do not understand why they keep adding them if their obviously not working? I've read about shunts being put in if the banding does not work; is anyone familiar with this? Please help I feel so helpless. He has thrown up all day today (2 bands thrown up). Doctors say he is a stage 4 cirrhosis; they've never mentioned if he's decomp or comp liver. Our doctor says overall he looks great; no accidtes (spell check). He has enlarged varricies tho and of course an enlarged spleen. I see all these people saying their loved ones were diagnosed with stage 4 cirrhosis and that the doctor said that's it there's nothing they can do so my question is WHY have they not told me this yet??? Should we even do hep c treatment if he's already stage 4? My heart is broke and I feel like my whole world has came tumbling down :(,2014,2014,28,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Good Morning all; Called Dr. office about my results the nurse said " It just showed your spleen was slightly enlarged which is normal with cirrhosis but your liver isn't enlarged and everything else pretty much looks normal." I asked what my MELD score was she didn't know what I was talking about so I then asked her if it was compensated or decompensated; she said "Well it doesn't say either but I guess it would be decompensated because of the spleen. What I really need help with is... 1. What important questions should I be asking him that will be helpful to me? 2. Do doctors usually remove the spleen when it is enlarged?

Nadolol+hypertension,My wife has cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. She is no longer drinking and is getting better. We got a scare when she started talking gibberish and just seemed out there; that's when we went to the Dr. and found out she has cirrhosis. 1 month later she started throwing up blood. We got that taken care of and now she is on the road to recovery (I hope). Anyway; she finally agreed to go to the gym with me; but I want to do it right. I read a book called "Hepatitus C cured" and how the author started training for a marathon and turns out that training helped drive certain enzymes into the liver that helped it along the way (I know she does not have Hep C; but the cirrhosis they both have in commom is what I am thinking about). I believe however that that book was written before HIIT traing wwas very popular; so my question is: Which is best to help my wife recover as much as popular?,2013,2013,47,Male

Last week mibi stress test normal at 98% maximal HR; MRI scheduled next week to rule out ARVD. 1. What would be the significance of latest echo findings; if any? EP is unconcerned; should I be? 2. Does this sound like it could be the aftermath of myocarditis? With my history how likely is ARVD? 3. EP has recommended ablation; how likely is this to be successful (assuming no ARVD). Any other comments or advice would be welcome. Thank you and sorry for the lengthy post.,2004,2004,49,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,I am a 29 yr old female; 5'6 1/2"; 150 lbs & used to be healthy . Since Jan; I've been having a lot of weird symptoms -episodes of racing heart (120); spikes/drops in bp (140/98 or90/58); leg tremors; flushing; lightheaded (while lying down;not upright); fatigue; blurry vision; jittery (extreme at times for hours; only seconds other times); itching face; especially eyes & nose; cold feet; achy legs; nausea; occasional hives; etc.. I can fell ok for days or weeks and then I hit a bad spell for days or weeks. I am unable to identify triggers; adide from heat; although many symptoms; especially hr & bp occur at night. Tests done: ekgs; echos; chest xrays; blood work; tilt table tests; eegs; mri (head; cervical spine; and abdomen); cat scans; 24 hour urines; stress test; and allergy tests. All were normal. Just recently; one batch of blood work showed low magnesium. I am taking supplements. I've seen every doctor in multiple disciplines and many could not find anything wrong. Multiple tests on heart and thyroid and even looked for rare things like pheo and carcinord. Last week Hyper beta adrenergic syndrome was suggested. Can you tell me more about that disorder. Toprol was prescribed but haven't started. Tried beta blockers before and didn't really help. Florinef sent me to ER with bp 154/105 three times and made me feel horrible. Prednisone did the same. Verapamil raised hr & bp. Lopressor made me feel horrible and thirsty. Nadolol gave me an irregular hr. I also just started getting vibrations in/under left breast that last few seconds. What is that?,2005,2005,,
Nadolol+hypertension,I have been dealing with PAC's for 5 years now. They have been of and on and very bothersome for me. I have extreme anxiety from them and deprission. I was put on 50 mg of coraguard and that seem to work ok but I wanted them to completly stop. So I went to the cardoligest again and he told me to try Motropol 50 mg twice a day. So I did and now I am having major premature atrial contraction all day every day. They are killing me. My doctor said that he still does not think it is from the medicine but I do. He ordered another holter mointiter because I asked about anti arrythmia drugs and said that because he has only seen a couple pac's on my workup that he can't give that to me. These pacs are going crazy and I need help badly. I think I want to come of the Motropol but I am worried that it will kill me. Can someone give me some advice as to what to do.,2010,2011,29,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,about 3 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Hep C and stage 4 cirrhosis. I quickly started treatment. I was working at the time and had health coverage provided by my employer. Though I was so sick; I kept going until the lab called me on a Sunday and advised me to stop meds and call my Dr. That Wednesday I saw my Dr. who advised me to go home and rest the meds had completely wiped me out. I applied for SSD; but it took a long time and while waiting I used all my savings; sold a car; refinanced our house; and ran our credit cards up so high I don't know if they'll ever get paid. Now I have EGD's every six months; I've also had 5 veins banded. My Dr. has mentioned a liver transplant; and told me we would talk more about it in September. My concern is how will I pay for it? I now have Medicare & Medicare Part D. Also the lifetime of expense meds I've heard about. I've been using med marijuana and now have my wieght back; but I also heard that this would prevent me from qualifying for a transplant. I know the end is near; and if the only obstacle is smoking pot; I'll quit. Otherwise; I will continue with this as I feel so much better after. I gave up drinking and drugging over 20 yrs; ago (except pot). Any info would be appreciated. (please-no anti smoking remarks),2012,2012,59,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,I have always been afraid to come on the cirrhosis forum because I don't want to know how sick I am.I am a lifetime non responder and the last 2 times I cleared only to relapse immediately.Geno 1a stage 4 a long time.What I call my death cramps have gotten as bad as they can get.I try sleeping sitting up now cause laying down doesn't work;the cramps keep coming;the painfully parylizing cramps.I drown myself with Gatorade and water but sometimes its not enough.They hit and I start stuffing banannas and magnesium and fluids down my throat.Any suggestions about anything else I can take to stop these cramps at bedtime.And please;no mention of what kind of trouble I'm in;I already know.Got an mri weds because my tumor marker score was off the charts and I cant start any treatment until they know the results of that.The doc says I have built up a huge resistance to the meds from all the failed treatments through the years.I just need some relief from these cramps right now though.

Nadolol+hypertension,I found this site several weeks ago; and have been repeatedly impressed by the thoughtful people who gather here. I am especially grateful to the "lab rats" who are posting their experiences; since it seems that I will be trying another round of treatment (hopefully when phase 3 comes out). In short; my info is: genotype 1a; cirrhotic with portal hypertension and recently diagnosed cryoglobulinemia (sp?). I am a non responder to the initial interferon; and a relapser from the phase 3 peg/riba trial. I didn't take too well to maintenance dosing; and am anxiously waiting for the next silver bullet to help me finally get rid of this bug. I'll be going for another endoscopy Friday morning;with possible banding; so I'm a bit anxious right now. It's helpful to have this site; and to be reminded that there are others out there who understand... Thanks for the forum.,2007,2007,,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,went to see the hepatologist today; he wants to do treatment was very happy to see that I was geno type 2. Before starting treatment he wants to do a scope to see if I have veriance (?) you guys know what I mean. Because my wbc was low and platlets also low. If I do hopefully I do not he will band them. Nervious; happy; scared but looking to get this stuff out of my body! He also said that now its almost 90% for type 2. Seeing as I dont have any other choices I guess I'll do it. I am actually more nervious about the scope; band thing than the treatment. We also talked about the rh factor rhogram shots that I had in the late 70s and early 80s when I had my kids and seeing as I had none of the other exposure; drugs; surgery; bloodtrans. he was thinking that was a pretty good guess. :( wish me luck and here we go on a wild adventure.,2011,2011,58,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,Does portal hypertension go away even with permanent damage from hep c; (cirrhosis) but after a successful treatment with sovaldi and olyssio?,2014,2014,54,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,My husband recently diagnosis with primary liver caner; according to CT scans and recent MRI's its still contained in the liver but throughout both lobes of the liver. this make him limited to different options offered; his platelet count low related to hep-c; he mainly drops off to sleep during the day; no significant pain; nausea; or bleeding; he does suffer severe leg cramps at night and some cramping or muscle spasms in his hand; no jaundice either; but he experienced a lot of itching at times; not on any treatment yet; expected to start on Nexavar soon and hoping for the best; no other treatment options offered. Can diet play a role along with medication help prolong survival longer than usually indicated. I heard of an alkaline diet vs an acidic diet; heard of controlled amino acid therapy and different foods which helps to starve the cancer cells; trying to help him before cancer spreads outside of liver and to different organs. he continues to work; but tires easily; his AFP blood levels recent results currently at 22000. Is it too late to do something; oh! esopgeal varices not bad; please reply; need serious help; he is only 59 y/o and my husband of nine years. thank you,2011,2011,58,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 29/M. In October I started having red/teary eye with sinus pain. PCP thought sinusitis. Later - tingling in left arm and leg; foggy state; headache on each side of head. After many CTs and MRIs and many other doctors - everything OK. Did B1; B6; B12; sinus CT; head CT; brain MRI in December; ENG in February - all negative. Finally did another MRI in March with some alarming news. Now I am freaking out because I've been referred to the MS center at UCSF. Here is the summary: Findings: The ventricals are normal in size and symmetric in the midline without evidence of mass effect or shift. Cortical sulci and subarachanoid spaces are symmtric and normal. There are two tiny white matter lesions adjacent to the trigone of the right lateral ventricle; seen only on the coronal FLAIR sequence. There is no contrast enhancement of these small lesions and no other contrast enhancing lesions are identified. No other abnormal foci of increased or decreased signal intensity are seen anywhere intracranially. Normal gray/white matter differentiation. Impression: 1. Two tiny white matter lesions adjacent to the trigone of the right lateral ventricle without evidence of surrounding edema or mass effect and not demonstrating contrast enhancement. The largest of these measures about 4 mm in size and the second measures 2 mm. These lesions are nonspecific and could represent some chronis gliosis or scarring. Early demyelinating disease cannot be entirely excluded. 2. Otherwise normal appearing magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. Any ideas? Thank you!,2006,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,I am the mother of a 15 year-old daughter that suffered cardiac arrest in October 2006 while playing volleyball. A defibrillator was used and she was brought back. Here is the history: * Surgery in November 2005 to correct a pectus excavatum. While in recovery she started throwing arrythmia's; lots of pvc; couplets etc. She had several EKGs and Echo's and there was no damage to the heart from the surgery. She had a metal bar implanted under her sternum known as the Nuss procedure. No incidence of PVCs before sugery; pre surg testing or any mention of of pvcs during her yearly physicals etc before her 2005 surgery. * Sudden cardiac arrest in October 2006 playing volleyball. She was cleared by her cardio to play sports upon entrance to high school. * The defib strip showed ventricular fibrillation. * Tox came back neg for any drugs etc. Potassium was a little low. * A week after her arrest she had a defib implanted. * She underwent genetic testing which came back negative for catecholamenergic ventricular tachy. * Family history of PVCs; mother (myself); nephew; brother and half sister. No incidence of any sudden cardiac death for any immediate or removed family member. * Newest holter reading shows an increase of over 30% of all heartbeats are pvc's. EP said a year ago she was 15%. * She takes 40 mg of Nadolol 2x day and 150 mg 2x a day of Mexiletine. * She has suffered from depression and eating disorder but no pvc diagnosis during either evaluations (before 2005 surgery). Her EP wants to do another echo to look at possible ARVD. She can no longer play sports and her quality of life is for the most part is not okay. She's always tired and can't do things that her friends can etc. etc. This in turn aggravates my PVCs and the vicious cycle begins. I guess my questions are: 1. Does this sound like it's getting worse. I really need honest answers. I need to know what I am dealing with. I have the utmost faith her doctor's; but we don't have a true diagnosis. 2. Should I be looking at Mayo or Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion? 3. Could the pectus surgery somehow triggered something? Thanks.,2007,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I have had hep. c genotype 2 for decades and in the past year have had symptoms of cirrhosis. Extreme itching; fatigue; ascites; edema; nosebleeds etc. I don't have hx insurance but I went to a clinic that does trial studies for interferon and 2 new drugs shown to be very effective for tx hep. c. The Dr. will do a biopsy but feels that I probably have cirrhosis which will preclude me from the studies at their clinic. My question is; if I have cirrhosis can I get tx (elsewhere) for hep. c or is it considered too dangerous to subject a cirrhotic liver to? Thanks,2011,2011,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Hep C now Cirrhosis since '08 Curious if anyone out there can tell me if ESLD patients can die without bleeding;etc?

Nadolol+hypertension,I have had 2 neck surgerys & I am still in pain. I have had C5-6 fused 8yrs ago & last yr I had C6-7 & I am still in a great deal of pain in my shoulders & down both arms & in my neck. I am still under doctors care but he is telling me there is nothing more he can do for me that I have to live with this pain. I have no life because after I get off work the only thing I want to do is use the heating pad & lye down to rest my neck. I do data entry 40hr a week & it is killing me to do that; I am not sure if I am going to be able to continue. My doctor is telling me that the data entry will not make me any worse than I am & I am finding that hard to believe since my job is hurting me so bad so I would like to know your opinion on that; Please. I have a copy of my last MRI it says there is mild facet hypertrophy in C2-3 with no signifcant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing. Then C3-4 There is very small left paracentral posterior disc osteophyte complex; unchanged. Associated mild facet hypertrophy results in mild left neural foraminal narrowing. No signifcant central canal or right neural foraminal narrowing. In C4-5 a very small broad based disc bulge minimally flattens the anterior thecal sac without signifcant central canal narrowing. Mild facet hypertrophy contributes to mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C5-6 There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing. No signifcant central canal or right neural foraminal narrowng. C6-7 post interval anterior discectomy & fusion w/mild left neural foraminal narrowing. I can fax the MRI report if needed t rest . Thank U,2007,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Just got my latest biopsy result and to be honest I'm kind of freaking out a little. Just taking the time to read through how much encouragement people give to others on this forum is very helpful. My last biospy in 2005 was stage 1 grade 1. I did 14wks of Pegasys then but was non-responder. I'm 48 y.o. male; also HIV+ (stable and undetectable) and otherwise very healthy; eat well and exercise regularly. I've been feeling perfectly fine...at least I was until now :( Now it looks like possible cirrhosis. I'm really stunned that it has progressed so fast: SUMMARY -Fragmented and nodular liver biopsy with at least focal bridging fibrosis -Chronic hepatitis C with minimal activity (grade 1 of 4) Comment: Although the degree of fragmentation here precludes accurate staging; the presence of nodular regeneration; focal bridging fibrosis and fragmentation raises concern for underlying cirrhosis. I'll be starting Infergen+RIbaviran as soon as dr gets insurance approval. How reversible is this likely to be - if I respond? And what else can I do to take care of myself? (I dont drink alcohol at all).,2010,2010,,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,After a long waiting for close to 4 months; the docs at government hospital have rated my mum as having Cirrhosis based Child-Pugh score with Grade B They did endoscopy-OGDS Oesphageal varices HCV and found the followings: 1. Small submucosal dilated veins at distal oesophagus. No ulcer/bleeding. 2. Extensive erythema at antrum with modular erosions at the body. 3. Portal gastropathy. No fundal varix seen. 4. D1 duodenitis. 5. D2 normal. Mum's blood platelets count is 86 and they refused to consider her the therapy. Also they indicated her chance of living for another 5 years is 50%-50%. They never mentioned anything on liver transplant options. Question for experts on this forum: 1. Is my mum really having less than 5 years to live or it can be more? 2. Does she has any other option like liver transplant for her age(60)? 3. Any latest medication for Cirrhosis? Hope to get some answers. Thanks All!

Nadolol+hypertension,Can anyone figure out what is going on with me? I do not have; nor can I afford; health insurance right now. Here's my story: I am a 28 y/o male who has been experiencing a heart flutter/vibration/palpitation while sleeping since May 09 (that I know of). Pretty much every night; within a minute of falling asleep; I am re-awoken by my heart vibrating. You can still feel the ventricle contractions at normal pace; but there is also another beat (atrial I'm assuming); which is normally 200-300 bpm; and feels like a vibration. Once I wake up it starts to go away. It is normally 3-4 times faster than my resting HR; and will shift down to about twice as fast; then shift again to normal rhythm - each of these shifts is very quick (ie it will be 300bpm then 150bpm two beats later); and normally takes about 1-2 minutes to return to normal. Once it finally shifts down to normal rhythm; my heart will usually then beat very hard a few dozen times; or more; before returning to relatively normal. This happens nearly every night; but varies in intensity depending on my stress levels. It also seems to occur only at certain times of the night - right when I fall asleep; about 3-4 hrs into my sleep; and then about 7-8 hrs into my sleep. My wife periodically feels my chest when I'm asleep and she generally reports it feels normal; but I am not sure if she can always feel it; but I have made her feel it before; so I would think most of the time her observation is correct. When it first happened last May I awoke at 4am and I though to myself; "Must be a small earthquake"; which would not be out of the ordinary where I live. But then I realized it was my heart and became very worried and went to the ER. They did an echo and everything was fine (I was awake; so of course). The doc did notice I had an ectopic beat though; which I didn't have before (I don't think); but now get daily and they fluctuate in frequency with my stress levels - some days my heart will skip every 3-4 beats all day long. I later went to the county clinic (as I cannot afford health insurance); and the doc there put me on propranalol; but dismissed the vibrations - claiming that it is not my heart; and if it were; I would not be able to feel it. He did recommend pressing on my jugular to relieve it; which worked; so he said then it had to be PAC or PSVT. But I am 1000% certain the vibration is my heart - I am not the only one who can feel it. I took the propranalol for about 6 months; then decided to step off it to see what happens and it has gotten better since coming off the meds; but has not gone away. That's the gist of what's bothering me right now; but there's more to this story that may give a clue as to what's going on; I don't know. A little background on me: I am 28; very fit; exercise regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke; don't do drugs or any other medications; drink moderately; only 1 cup of coffee a day; don't have any allergies; no other medical problems - I was the epitome of health and fitness before this started happening. However; last year when this all started happening was one of the most stressful times in my life. I am normally a "Type A"; higher stress individual; but not to any sort of extreme (I'm not really even much of a worrier). I was nearing the end of college (read: finals); newly married; working 3 jobs; getting very little and irregular sleep; and was very strained financially. In January 09 I experienced a sudden chest pain while bagging up some groceries at the store. It was very sudden; sharp; and intense; deep in the center of my chest. It was so intense in fact that it nearly knocked me over - I had to grab onto the counter to stay standing. It really freaked me out; but I am so healthy that I figured it probably wasn't anything serious and I would just monitor any changes. Then it happened about 2 weeks later while sitting in class; but less intense this time. It kept happening every few weeks; for several months; but every time it happened it was less intense and not as painful; until it was just a slight uncomfortable twinge. In the last 6 months or so it’s only happened once or twice; and only very slightly. Then the sleep event happened in May; where I went to the ER and eventually got on the propranalol. For about the first 3 weeks after the trip to the ER I was extremely stressed; worried; and scared about my heart issue; on top of being right in the middle of finals. For those few weeks my heart constantly beat very hard in my chest; not fast; but like it was trying to leap out of my chest. I had a lot of skipped beats; felt light-headed on the worse days; and generally felt like I could drop dead any minute. I abstained from anything that could aggravate my condition - caffeine; alcohol; exercise; etc. Eventually I calmed down and the symptoms improved. This convinced me that it was likely being exacerbated by my anxiety and stress. Over time I reincorporated things back into my normal life - exercise first; as I am a field scientist. Then caffeine and alcohol each and they didn't seem to bother my heart much (alcohol moreso; but nothing much to worry about). But my sleep issue remained and only fluctuated with stress levels. So I tried eliminating the pills; which did help as I mentioned; but my problem persists. And some nights it seems as though it is inordinately intense considering relatively low levels of anxiety/stress. So I'm still confused about it. Sorry for the long post; but I just want to make sure to include as much info as possible. I have more to tell but it exceeded the post limit. Does anyone have any idea what is going on?,2010,2010,28,Male
Nadolol+hypertension,Hello Doctor; I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hosting this forum; I've posted once before and have found it very informative and helpful; thank you! I have a few questions concerning PVC's & PAC's. I have been evaluted by two different cardiologists with a battery of tests and everthing is normal; noted 1/2 apical ejection (flow) murmur only (28 year old male; 5' 11"; 190LBS; athletic). 1. From what I understand now; PVC's & PAC's are not harmful; is either worse than the other? ie. more PVC's 2. Is the sensation of a skipped beat the result of an extra beat or is the sensation from the extra flow of blood resulting from a longer pause in the heart rythm? 3. If an individual is experiencing for example 1;000 PAC's/PVC's on a daily basis; does that signify an extra 1;000 beats? Wouldn't these extra beats over a span of an average life "tire" the heart muscle? 4. I notice in my resting pulse only (around 48-52BPM) that sometimes after relaxing from either a work-out or just normal activity that a few beats are longer apart then others; however this is pattern is repeatitive; meaning the longer pause are not totally random but will repeat after the same number of beats per minute. My question is what's considered and irregular to regular pulse? 5. From your experience with past and present patients; have you seen any individuals experiencing PVC's/PAC's every go away entirely? 6. Are they the cause of some part of SA/NA node's deteriating? 7. Lastly on average; individuals with normal healthy hearts with benign PVC's/PAC's develop other serious conditions?,2001,2002,,

Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat? I am wating to see an electrophysiologist for an EP study to see what is going on. My hope is that this can be corrected quickly. I am taking metroporal and asprin daily. I am way too young for heart problems; and the stress is what is bothering me most! Can stress and anxiety cause Atrial Fibrillation??,2007,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,I am a 38 yr old female. About a year ago I started to experience a very strange feeling that occurs periodically when I move from a sitting to a standing position and start to walk. The sensation is as if my head and neck are throbbing with pressure and I have to stop walking or slow down and stop and stand still for a minute or so to make the sensation stop. Sounds are muffled in rhythm with the pulsations and I sometimes feel as if I will pass out; but never have. There is no pain. I have been checked throughly by my GP; a cardiologist; and an electrophysiologist and none of them could find a cause. It does seem to happen sometimes when I am hungry and have missed a meal or eaten later than usual. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.,2007,2007,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this post. 10 days ago; my brother; who is 50; was diagnosed with chirrosis of the liver; Hep B and C. He was told his White blood platlets were 40 and was suppose to be 100. I don't know what that means really? Also; The trunk of his body is yellowish; the whites of his eyes are yellowing as well. We are not 10 days past the diagnosis and I am still trying to get him seen by a GI Dr. Everyone seems to be dragging their feet. I notice he is often tired; he is itchy at night; eating exsessivley but he is not at all overweight. His stomach was swollen; which is what first lead him to going to the hospital. He complains of his right side hurting him a lot. He is taking vitamins; some milk something or other that is suppose to help the liver. I just would like for someone to help me understand all of this; his general practice doctor told him she would suspect he had 6 to 9 mos. to live. How could she possibly know this? She is no expert; and certainly not God. Can someone please lead to to things he could do to boost the white blood platlets while I wait to get him in to a GI; can someone offer some suggestions about their experience or what I need to know; do; or expect. I am truly at a loss and I feel as though my hands are tied. Again; Thank you for your time. Sincerely; Chelle,2011,2011,,Female
Nadolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called "overdrive suppression". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights! Can't sleep :( Erik,2010,2010,,
Nadolol+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement. Anyone with any help or suggestions I would REALLY appreciate it.,2008,2008,,
