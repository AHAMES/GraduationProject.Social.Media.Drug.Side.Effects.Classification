aspirin,Doctor; I take a 81mg. tablet of aspirin daily as recomended by a cardiologist a few years ago. I take the Depo-Provera shot which one doctor says it can increase your chance of having a stroke if you smoke as I do. (one Doc said that it was not as likely to happen as with the pill so I dont know which one is correct) But anyway my question is will the aspirin I take maybe offset the chance of a stroke from the cigarettes and Depo? Thank you.,1999,1999,,

aspirin,Maybe a dumb question but.... I am pretty sure it was on the Clomid Club site; but I read that some women ttc take baby aspirin (can't remember why). It has just been on my mind when I look at the bottle in my medicine cabinet and wonder about Ryes Syndrome for the baby. Does anyone know why this would be a benefit to ttc and why Ryes Syndrome is not a concern? Is it because it is 'baby' aspirin (I didn't think that was even given to kids anymore),2006,2006,,
aspirin,Hello all. Have any of you heard of baby aspirin therapy to prevent miscarriage? I had a chemical pregnancy in September; then a miscarriage at 5 wks in November and now I'm testing positive again for pregnancy.

I am just wondering if any of you have tried this or heard of this and know of any success stories? Please let me know. Thanks!,2006,2006,45,Female

Fentanyl,I found this forum and am very pleased to see all the information and support. I've been Rx'd fentanyl (50mcg's) and Hydrocodone (10/500's) for a serious back/spinal injury. I use the patches one every 2 days; as directed. They never lasted the 72 hours; so they dr's said to put one on every second day. That's where I am. Unfortunately they aren't lasting the 48 hrs and I'm getting the W/D symptoms on day 2. The hydro's resolve that; at least temporarily. I'm tired though; I'm tired of the meds and I'm really scared to see how addicted I've become. I didn't realize it; went cold turkey and got HORRIBLY sick..so I went back on them. I WANT OFF!! I don't really have a strong characther; have very bad depression and VERY bad anxiety; so without it I get horribly panicy; something I've been hospitalized for in the past. Went to my psych today who is luckily one of the ones locally who deals with Suboxone. He says I have to totally get ALL the opiates out of my system for it to work; but that is my nightmare; because that is when the nerves tick up; the depression and bad thoughts tick up and the real sickness sets in. I am eager to try but am VERY scared to go through withdrawl; relapse and the whole works. Just the 3rd day was horrible; I am not strong enough to do that again. I don't know why I'm posting; I guess I'm looking for some advice and praying that this Suboxone will keep me sane and well and pick up where my mental and physical strenght leaves off. Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Fentanyl,I am on day 16 no actiq. Doing ok for those that care. Those that don't skip my post. Reading some real horsesh*t on here lately; but I am getting better at shutting up. Just an update; I know there are questions posted for me at times. Still reading; although I sometimes vomit a little in my throat. I'll just keep listening for now though. Thanks all for your posts.,2007,2007,53,Male
Fentanyl,I have recently began using Fentanyl 50mcg/hr Transdermal Patches. Previously I had been taking 80mg of Oxycontin bid as well as 10mg of Percocet tid to control breakthrough pain. My physician at that time discontinued the Oxycontin and Percocet cold turkey. Te next month of my life was pure hell and I believe I almost died. The resulting health issues were a kidney infection; bladder infection; UTI as well as severe dehydration with associative muscle cramping. My total weight loss was 60lbs. I am concerned with the possible and eventual withdrawal from the Fentanyl. Is the withdrawal as rough as Oxycontin? I have several questions but I will start with this one for now. T%hank you in advance for your reply and I am happy to be a member of this community.,2008,2008,58,Male
Fentanyl,Hello! I been over on the Painmngmt. mainly but have a question regarding Fentanyl i hope someone can help me with. I'm currently weaning down on Fentanyl 25mcg. This is my 5th day and my schedule looks like this. 1st keep 2 25mcg patches on for 3days. Next put 2 25mcg keep those on for 3days. Next put 1 25mcg and leave that on for 3 days and the last put1 25mcg patch on and leave on for 3days. After this i'm done. I was started on 25mcg and went quickly up to 100mcg whithin 4weeks. I had to go down to 75mcg the 100mcg was to much. So i been on Fentanyl now for about 6weeks and wondering if i will have any W/D from being on this high dose. I have 80 vicoprofen 7.5/200mg that is suppose to take care of the pain but i think they are going to be too weak. I hope it's OK to ask this if not just delete this thread. I did not want to go on Fentanyl but the Doc. kept on insisting on trying it. Thanks; F1swede,2008,2009,52,Male
Fentanyl,Hi Folks! I been on various painmeds for almost 5years now. I also been on Suboxone but it gave me no painrelief. After going off the Suboxone i was put on Vicoprofen 7.5/200mg 120 monthly. The Suboxone has really kicked my tolerance up. I'm having a hard time following the script. I went to my Doc. today and he wants me to start on Fentanyl. I tried this once before and i got very tired so i thought this is not going to work for me. If i remeber right they were 12mg patches. I also been on Vicodin ES; Percocet; MS Contin; Suboxone; Vicoprofen. I'm wondering if this is a drug that you can function on as far as work and also if 20mg patches are to strong to start out. I know i'm very tolerant to painmeds but have no real experience with Fentanyl. The last time i did not stay with it. When i started MS Contin i also got very tired for about a week very much like the Fentanyl i used before. Hope fully some one has some input on this. The Doc. seems t think this is a good drug for me. I'm thinking about the jump to the "big gun pain med." so i'm a little leary about this. I have bad pain but i dont know about this. Any help on this would be great. Thanks; F1swede,2008,2009,52,Male

Fentanyl,I used to put patches on my shoulders an it was ok; now since I've lost some weight it seems patches will only work when I put them on sides of my chest even when I put them I front of chest it doesn't work and also why can't you overlap where you put last patch like take one off and put new one in same place cause when I do it works very well for pain;and I definitely start feeling withdrawal from fentanyal when I put them anywhere but my sides I'm assuming my core temperature is hotter there than arms or shoulders and I also feel alot better if I change them daily verses every two days.which makes no sence at all since it take 24 hours to build up in system but since insurance company usually demands prior orthorization every six months; and this time they ok prio oth. For six years I don't want to take a chance to ask for a higher dose and I definitely need it. this ***** but any one noticing that Patches work better on sides of chest other than outer body and does anyone overlap patches in same spot an anyone change daily thanks?Also it says in pamphlet that u might encounter slow urination or not being able to empty bladder completly and alway feeling like I have to urinate! Anyone else please I sleep threw the night but I get all those symptoms I've been on this med. for fifteen years so getting of will suck :(:(:(:(:(:(,2012,2013,,Female
Fentanyl,I have had about 19 knee surgeries. This includes 2 knee replacements.I need to have my right knee re-replaced due to an infection. I also have neuropathy in my feet. Very; very painful. I have been on hydrocodone for almost 20 years on and off. Went to the pain clinic and he put me on the Fentanyl patch 12mcg. I have so many drug allergies that the drs are limited as what they can give me. I am ok with one patch but when I put on the second patch I got chest pains; nervous; nauseated. Took second patch off felt better. Call dr next day told them what happened. He said to take up to 3 10/325 hydrocodone a day. Took one and it overdosed me. took that patch off too. Went to pain clinic yesterday he told me to put patch back on and try half of the 10/325 and let him know on Monday. I feel like I'm not getting any relief with just one patch on. I would actually like to go back to just taking pain pills but the dr doesn't want to go that route. Does the fentanyl help with nerve pain.,2008,2013,62,Female
