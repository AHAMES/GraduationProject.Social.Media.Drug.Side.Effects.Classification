Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This is really a post for a friend of mine. He has had Type II diabetes for years but is finding very hard to control as his Metformin AS 500mg makes him sick every day.He takes it in the morning just before breakfast and is nauseous the rest for the day. As such he skips taking it most of the time with his glucose in the 300's and even when he does take it his glucose is in the high 200's. He is wondering if any other diabetics have had this problem with the metformin? Dennis,2008,2011,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,hi i am neethu;my mom has type 2 diabetes since 1 yr and age is 43 yrs; First time we consulted 1 doctor he gave some tablets but my moms sugar level was around 220-230 range and later due to his selfish nature to gain more money has suggested insulin intake at earlier stage itself which was not needed and was harmfull; so we left that doctor and consulted other doctor and her BP is always at normal range only; empty stomach sugar test range is 160-163; and after breakfast sugar test range is 140-143; HBA1C test is 8.0; the doctor whom we are consulting now has suggested the following tablets istamet 50mg/1000mg (before breakfast); Gemer forte 2(night after dinner); Lipirose 10 (night after dinner);Axeten H (Morning after breakfast) So as said above the doctor has given 4 tablets to take per day; my doubt is 1. Why the doctor has given that many tablets to my mom when some other doctors suggest just 1 or 2 tablets for their patients having same problem?? 2. Are the tablets which that doctor suggested are good and correct for my mom? What medicines would you suggest for my moms condition so that i can ask the doctor we are consulting. Please help me as soon as possible it would be of great help to me. Thank you.,2012,2012,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been on Byetta (stomach injections)for about 8 months. The first 6 months was the lowest dosage and now it is doubled (the highest dosage). There is no rhyme or reason concerning the A1C levels - currently 7.6%! and I have not lost any weight either - which is suppose to be a side affect (one I was looking forward to). My blood work is good for my heart disease; but not for the diabetes. I teach exercise classes but also have fibromyalgia and ostioarthritis; so exercising more would really be a chore; I've cut back on portions and have introduced more fruit and vegetables in my diet. I know if I lost at least 25lbs; I would feel better and hopefully get my A1C down. HELP - What else can I do to loose weight?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just realized that I haven't seen my diabetes specialist in about three years. On my last visit she "discharged" me to the care of my internist. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 5 years ago; at age 62. My glucose levels are stable at around 110; hB!ac 5.9. I've recently lost 25 kg; do some mild exercise and feel good. I'm taking metformin twice a day (750 mg). In addition to my internist; I'm followed by a blood pressure specialist (now weaning me of medication); a cardiologist; a gastroenterologist (weight loss program) and a neurologist (diabetic neuropathy- stable). I think I've got everything pretty well covered...but is there anything that a diabetes specialist could add to this mix?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,After three rounds of Interferon; Ribaviron; and something else; each for 48 weeks; I am left with high fasting blood glucose and A1C of 6.0. My fasting sugars range from 134 to 160. They used to be 104 or less. I went to diabetes center for diet counseling; I walk and ride my bicycle 6 times a week; weather permitting and still may have to get pills to control this blood sugar problem. The diet modifications have not helped. I have no family history of diabetes. MCV is also out of range. I have been considered free of the Hep C virus for 2.5 years now. Had stage 3 plus liver damage with type 3 then was told it was type 1. Who knows? Any comments? Thanks. Bobbie,2016,2016,64,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,When I had a heart attack (MI) in 1992 I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic and was advised of the need to take insulin for the rest of my life.As the years went by and my insulin intake increased along with my weight but my sugar level remained fairly consistent HbA1c approx 7.2. In 2005 I decided on a life style change predominantly targeted at reducing my weight and found that I could reduce my insulin intake.Within six months I no longer needed to take insulin at all and my HbA1c went down to 6.1 and now for two years I still don't need to inject insulin or take any insulin type medication. This year I started to explore if it was possible to lower my blood sugar levels to an non diabetic level and have made progress in that direction by adding alpha lipoic acid to my daily intake and almost immediately saw by blood sugar drop and have a average reading of 5 which should mean my next HbA1c test is much lower than previously ; namely in the region of 5 . As I have been making this change my cholesterol medication has dropped from 40mg per day to 5 ; with the hope I can get off it completely and blood pressure medication reduced by 50%. I am curious to know of other peoples experience with alpha lipoic acid.,2007,2008,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 6 months ago and placed on Metformin 500mg twice a day. Within 30 days I was experiencing frequent nausea (with no vomiting). My MD thought it might be caused by Metformin so he changed to Glucotrol XL 10mg twice a day. For a few days it appeared to work; but the nausea returned and seem to get worse. I had been doing a very poor job of controling what I eat. Could my nausea be caused by high blood sugar ?,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am new here and have a question. I am 22 and have never had a period. I was diagnosed with PCOS three or four years ago. I never really thought anything of it. I was never sure if I wanted children and I had no problems with not having to deal with a period. I have moderate hirituism but I could deal with it. Recently I was in the hospital for another condition I have had since birth; everyday when they did the normal labs my blood glucose came back high. Doctors never mentioned it then and I had no clue that was the case until my sports medicine doctor at the university I attend mentioned it during my yearly sports physical. She tested my blood sugar that day and it was high again; yesterday I did the glucose tolerance test and I am waiting for the results. I am not sure if I am over reacting or if it is valid to be worried. Has anyone here been diagnosed with diabetes with PCOS? Did you know you had it/did you have symptoms or was it found with normal testing? What were the symptoms if you had them?,2010,2011,13,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This is just the end snippet of a study. Please visit the below link for the whole story. -W ---------------------------------------------------- http://www.elements4health.com/inflammatory-biomarkers-not-reduced-by-insulin-metformin-in-diabetes.html The study concluded that in patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes; treatment with insulin or metformin compared with placebo did not reduce inflammatory biomarker levels despite improving glucose control. "From a clinical perspective; until other end-point trial data become available; these data underscore the need to improve adherence with therapies that do reduce cardiovascular events among diabetes patients; including exercise; weight management; smoking cessation and blood pressure control" the study authors add. -------------------------------------------------------- I draw no conclusions; but other better informed people might about how this may tie into people with HCV or as it pertains to HCV; TX and response rates. best; Willy,2006,2009,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed 6 years ago with Graves and treated with radioactive iodine. Seemed to do the trick and I went hypo; then treated with levrotyroxine. 6 years later I develop type 2 diabetes. Both these diseases by different doctors were treated like a cold; take these pills and call me in the morning. Another words; I was never told how to care for either. Went I went to the hospital my diabetes #'s were 1000 and my cholesterol was 1200; blood pressure 150 over 98. They recommended metformin; glipizide; lisinopril; aspirin; and cholesterol meds. Now; I have low blood sugar down to 30 by the time I treat it; hurting calves all the time and either feel nausea or crappy all the time. the Doc can't seem to get them both under control and is constantly testing while I feel like ****.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; my fasting blood sugar was 175. I am sure that these are on the higher side of the scale.

After two weeks when i went on re test; it was 140 on fasting. I have not used any medicine. But my question is how long i have to adopt ? is it reversible can i get back to < 100 ?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 61 yr old woman. For about 2 years I have had type 2 adult onset diabetes. Food mangement with Metformin and Glyburide. MG. usually 80- 140. Yesterday I was sick with flu like symptoms including a fever and chills. I slept off and on for 36 hrs while getting up to eat what I could. My left foot and ankle have been swelling for about 3 yrs and more so for the last yr as I now sit more at work. This morning I got up to find my left foot; ankle and lower leg with a red rash somewhat raised; and tender. My (Dr.) is an ARNP and has been for around the last 2 yrs. I have asked her about it and the off and on tenderness in my right lower back. She told me to buy compress socks and ordered a urine test. The socks I did not buy and the test was okay. I have wondered if it has something to do with my kidneys? Probably would have shown up in routine diabetes blood tests? I am having mixed feelings about finding a Dr. that is more experienced. What do you think about my foot; leg swelling. my lower back and getting a more experienced health provider? Thanks so much.,2011,2011,60,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi there; I'm 26 and I have been diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I can't get much out of my doctor; so I wanted to ask you to tell me your experiences with this syndrome -- What are your insulin levels for instace? Mine was 3 times higher than normal when I checked it 2 years ago! How many of you have already developed diabetes? Does everyone with PCOS develop diabetes and; if so; when? At what age?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm in my early 50's and have never had blood glucose problems. I had blood work done a few months ago that was normal except for very high triglycerides. I also have asymptomatic gall stones. A few weeks ago I notice that there was an increase in the frequency of urination; I was losing weight and vision had become blurry - although not consistently. Recently my doctor found glucose in my urine and a stick test showed the level to be 270. There have been no major changes in my lifestyle. I have been less active than usual. I haven't exercised regularly in several years. What would account for this sudden and dramatic change - from normal fasting blood glucose a few months ago to a reading of 270 now? I have the metformin that was prescribed; but I would much rather be able to regulate my insulin sensitivity naturally. Any help understanding this change would be appreciated.,2008,2008,51,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes when I was Pregnant with my Twins in 2012 after having the Glucose Intolerance Test it proved I was slightly over the threshold. I was given Metformin tablets to help bring my Blood Sugars down; and was told that once the twins were born it would go.....But it could come back one day. After having the twins at my 6 weeks post natal check up I had another Glucose Intolerance test done and it showed things were within the normal range. But last year I began showing signs and symptoms of diabetes and went to my G.P who sent me for tests that came back as positive for Type 2 Diabetes.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have had idiopathic angioedema attack as far back as early 1980's; it will flare up and in the past has gone dormaint for years. Now it's back and worse than ever. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about a year ago. So far the diabetes medication seems to cause the flares to be worse. I've tried metformin; actos; glipzide; and the latest one glimepiride (which seems to have by far the worst reactions thus far). Once a flare hits it last for more than 72 hours. I have had all kinds of allergy test run; nothing. I have had all kinds of blood work done. I have a high sed rate and high c-reactive proteins; high cholestrol and triglisrides; severe sleep apnea. The doctors have checked for autoimmune nothing shows. Does anyone have any information on idiopathic angioedema and diabetes combined? I am a 51 year old woman. Any ideas?,2009,2009,51,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am getting these dark red blister looking things on my right foot only. They show up several at time; usually on the sides of my foot and in the arch. They are hard and don't seem to have any fluid in them. One day it will show up and in a week it will go away and there will be lots of dry skin to peel away. Now on the right side of my right foot there is a place the size of a nickel that must have been dark red at one time and now the skin has come off. Its hard for me to get to that side of my foot due to my weight but if i stretch my leg out I can see it. Well; last night I saw that it was like a patch of dry skin and it was like a couple of layers of skin had been removed and the "inside" of the spot had a red tint to it; like sunburn; not like a red blister; but it is sore. It never happens on my left foot. Do you know what this might be and how I should treat it?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was prediabetic 10 months ago. And I have been walking for 60-90 minutes daily and sometimes body weight exercises. Now the way I feel like tired in morning and through out the day (first day today August 30) I am concerned I might have this disorder because I started to eat sugary foods for few days in last week at night like mangoes; bananas milk; dark and milk chocolate and worst of all; I ate KFC chocolate cookie which I hate most.. If I can't sleep I start eating at night How can I reverse this I know some say its impossible. From this website and doctor say that fasting can help reverse this condition by burning off excess sugar. It does make sense. Is this legitimate. And there are certain supplements like Alpha Lipoic Acid; Chromium Pliconate; Magnesium; etc. I have NOW Magnesium Also I used like to carry groceries from shop to my car and from car to my home. I find it hard to do that as well. I don't know what should I do.,2009,2016,27,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi there- have type 2 diabetes and am doing well on metformin and lifestyle changes. Numbers are well within range now. My question is - even though my diabetes is ' under control' right now- why do I still have urgency to urinate and frequency? I thought that would be controlled as long as my diabetes is controlled. Have not had a uti since way before diagnosis.... and last month when urgency started - went for a urine test which came out clear -- they gave me cipro - which relieved it for a while- but now the urge is back. Any advice is welcome and thank you.,2010,2012,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello. First time posting as I've been diagnosed diabetic only 2 weeks ago. I'm a 30 year old woman; in good health with no other known medical issues; until now. I recently found out that I am diabetic but the doctors can't detemine which type. (I know they can do an antibody test but for some reason it was cancelled.) Here were/are my symptoms so I want to get opinions on type 1 or 2...extreme thirst; fever; sluggish and tired; loss of appetite; keytones in urine; KDA; A1C was 7.9%; low potassium; resting heart rate above 110; extreme vision change and vitamin d deficiency. Blood sugars were anywhere from 300's to 506 at highest point. I had flu-like sickness with a sinus infection and bronchitis earlier in December. Can a sickness cause diabetes to appear out of nowhere? This was just something that hit me out of nowhere...other than my parents being diasgnosed diabetic in their 50's and 60's. I'm on insulin for now and metformin trying to get my sugars under control. I spent a night in hospital trying to get this sorted out. I just want opinions while I wait to get into a specialist. Thanks! :-),2016,2017,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I am not sure where to post this. I hope this is the right place. I was diagnosed as transitioning to cirrhosis in 2008. I treated over two years ago for HCV and am now cured. About 6 weeks ago I started taking Metformin for Diabetes Type 2. I was a little concerned to take it since my liver is damaged but was told the benefits outweighed the benefits. For the first couple of weeks the side effects were really bad as far as gastrointestinal disorder. I called the doctor and she said that this was normal and to give it time; I would adjust. While that calmed down a bit I continued to feel nauseated and started to have muscle cramps in my shin; rapid heart rate; feeling out a breath; etc. I looked up adverse reactions to metformin on WebMd and saw that many sx were the same as what I was experiencing. My question is this. Is it safe to take Metformin when a person has cirrhosis? I am thinking of stopping the metformin; controlling my sugar level with diet and a supplement called Nopal cactus. I have read that this supplement can help with various problems. I would really appreciate any help you can provide; Dee,2007,2014,2,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mother is 57 years old. She was found diabetes type 2 in 2010. In 2010: Blood sugar is 7.3 mmol/L before meal and 9.8 mmol/L after meal. The doctor didn't give any medicine or treatment; just give advice to control sugar input and do some sport. In 2012: Blood sugar is 8.9 mmol/L before meal and 10.0 mmol/L after meal. The doctor gave Metformin and three pills a day. But it was not that helpful...Blood sugar is always 8.3 mmol/L before meal and 9.5 mmol/L after meal. In 2015: Still use Metformin. But blood sugar is 11.8 mmol/L before meal and 13.0 mmol/L after meal. The doctor thinks it is too high and gave Recombinant Insulin Glargine Injection and my mother does 15 unit injection every night. But blood sugar is still like 7.3~8.3 mmol/L before meal and 9-10 mmol/L after meal. Is this often to see among diabetes type 2 patients?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My grandmother; 75 yrs of age; is a diabetic for past 15-20 years; taking metformin (2g daily) plus insulin (40+35). Where I am from we don't usually give a basal bolus regimen; just 70/30 in morning and evening. She also has history of IHD one year back. Recently; her renal function tests revealed a creatinine of 2.0 (178micromole/L). Her GFR according to MDRD equation is less than 30. This clearly means metformin should be stopped. However; when I stopped her metformin; she developed high blood glucose (9.7 fasting); so now I am not sure what to do? Are oral agents really needed with insulin for glucose control? And if not; how many units am I to increase her morning/evening insulin dose on each adjustment? How frequently to monitor? I myself am a doctor; so I know to always get the patient checked before any modification in treatment; but I just thought to also obtain the view of any experienced doctor over the internet as well.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My parents are lot concerned about type 2 diabetes (cause of heredity) of my boyfriend. My parents are worried and concerned about our marriage. Looks like they are unhappy; feared about the complications; Child birth and may reject the proposal. Recently; a doctor advised my family on marrying a diabetic. She has insisted on my boyfriend developing complication in future ; may be within 10 years and he is only 22 now. Her talk was so scary that she insisted on the partners sacrifices for the diabetic and health risks and also lesser life span Because of this; my parents are not willing to go ahead in this wedding talks.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was recently diagnosed the end of June of this year with Type 2 Diabetes. I am on metformin 100mg in the evening with dinner. My question is that whenever (most times) I eat; I get very sleepy. Doesn't matter if I am eating something that is basically carb free; I get to the point where I can't keep my eyes open. This is very unusual for me because I have had problems with sleep due to another medical condition for years. I lay down because I will go to sleep sitting up (and have) sleep a couple of hours and be fine. Again; this is not after eating sweets; or starches; but something I am supposed to eat. Anyone else have this problem? My A1C is just barely over what it is supposed to be; and my BG levels other than first thing in the morning are great. In the am they are in the high 120'/low 130's. Anyone else have this and what can be done to help it? Time of day makes no difference.,2009,2009,51,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed June 5; 2007. My eyes were always very good until 2003 i started needing glasses and forever they pretty much stayed as bad as they have been til i was diagnosed. My doc sent me to get my eyes checked when i was diagnosed; doc told me no blood vessels popped but needed major correction. I never got glasses so now more then a year later my eyes are really bad; seems every month for sure they are getting worse. I use to have trouble reading far; like a billboard with small letters. But now even seeing 3 feet in front of me looking at the calendar across my desk is where squinting wont even let me read it. My sugar has been out of control for past 2-3 months because i just havent had a chance to get to the doc.. last time i went my A1c was 7.5 from 8.1 so it went down but i know its gone back up because during the last month i've gotten 300-400's and thats with taking 1000mg of metformin twice daily; 45mg actos once daily and taking 12units of Lantus in the Morning and 8 at night. My doctor gave me humalog for fast acting but its not in the pen form like Lantus; and i dont have access to a fridge everytime im gonna eat. so i never do it. I wanna ask him for the Humalog pen i've even printed out a free trial coupon to go with the prescription. But im scared to go because i know he'll be upset i didnt go sooner. SO i got 2 questions. #1: Do you think i could have Type 1 instead of Type 2 cause how could i progress so fast in not even 2 years yet; going from great control with just the metformin to poor control with so much; i've heard type 2s go to insulin but over 20 years not 2. And im only 22 and weigh 176; i've lost 20 pounds since diagnosed. So shouldnt i be needing less insulin not more if im a true type 2? #2: Could my eyes go this bad this fast from my sugar; am i looking at blindness at a young age?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Now a dx of Diabetic Type II has been made based on a 3-hour Glucose Tolerance Test. Told that Dr a year ago there was more going on that merely Thyroid and Perimenopause. Was I ever right! Turns out that in an overview of regular blood tests; I don't indicate any problems. Because of that; he turly believed nothing would be found abnormal. Fasting blood glucose is still in the Normal range despite it takes 3 hours on the GTT for my glucose to get back to a normal level. Fasting Glucose - 100 1 Hour - 204 2 Hour - 181 3 Hour - 125 So now it's Diabetes; Hypothyroid and Fibromyalgia Any thoughts to be shared are appreciated. This is all new to me! Sal,2009,2011,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi Folks; I have prediabetes for the last 8 years or so and have been controlling with diet so far.I was doing lot of excercise and physical stuff for Initial 4 years but 4 years or so have been quite lazy and not doing much excercise due to my work routine as I work shifts and can not manage to maintain same routine everyday. As a result my A1C numbers have been going up. Last year in December my A1c was 6.5 and this year 6.1 (slight improvement but still much higher). In addition I also had low Vitamin D last and doctor asked me to take Vitamnin d regularly which I did not take seriously. Had my tests done again including Testesterone levels this time and my Sugar is high ; Vitamin D is low and Testesterone is also quite low ( 190). I am going to see my doctor next week and will discuss the options for Testesterone injection. In addition to the blood tests; I also feel some symptoms of arthritis like condition in my fingers and get tired very quickly. I would like to know what folks think on this forum with regards to my treatment options; Should I go on medication for Diabetes or just treat the low T and control the diabetes with diet alone? I am only 38 and have very active life/marriage. What does the future look for me ? How long can I go on like this and will be recover the low T or will be on meds permanently? Thanks.,2009,2017,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 66 y/o newly diagnosed diabetic. Went to hospital with chest pains and found out I was diabetic. Miraculously no damage done to eyes; feet; kidneys but discovered a heart anomaly. I started out at 254 lbs and I dieted all last year and was unsuccessful with losing weight. On Dec 5 my doctor prescribed Metformin 1500 mg at night; but I have been taking in the morning. I was extremely nauseated and had diarrhea the first two weeks; but now I'm only have nausea very occasionally and getting better. The most amazing thing (I thought) was that the weight started peeling off me 2 weeks ago. I now weigh 238 lbs. That's 16 lbs since Dec 5. I got very anxious about the weight loss and thought I had cancer and then went to the pharmacy and started research and found out it was the met that was doing it. One morning I woke up and had shed 4 lbs overnight. I generally have very little appetite - use to lick my plate and now I don't finish even the smallest meal. I do seem to crave sweets late in the evening. (Maybe I SHOULD take it in the evening! I try to drink more water and eat a lot of yougurt but I'm not on any particular diet. My blood sugars are running 120 to 150. My problem is starch. I'm sure if I had stayed on a strict diet I would have lost 20 lbs. I haven't had diabetic counseling so I've been hunting here and there trying to figure out what to eat. I will say this - I'm not severely out of breath as I was before I lost these 14 lbs. It's 27 degrees F. out right now and I'm sweating at the nape of my neck. I had to turn heat off in the house and don't feel cold at all. Has anyone else had sweating? I know I need to start exercising more and get a better diet; so I'll be working on that after the holidays.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 49 year old woman. I was diagnosed w type 2 diabetes two years ago. Since that time I have been taking metformin 500x3per day w 'permission' to take a 4th if a social situation should require further food intake. I am VERY careful what I eat; and I exercise and get enough sleep and try to take good care of myself. I have a new doctor who ran all his own tests. I also have Hashis hypothyroid. My thyroid #s came back high so I have to lower them asap. But what has me concerned is that after seeing the HA1C result {0.054 (range 0.043-0.060) - dr is saying that he does not think I have diabetes at all; and he wants to withdraw the Metformin. (I am in Canada if that makes a dif in reults). My question is - isn't my A1C good BECAUSE I take the Metformin? I mean; isn't that what its for - to get back within range with blood sugars? Does this result say to YOU that I do not have diabetes after all? What will happen to me if he withdraws the Metformin?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My testosterone level and triglycerides level are high. The doctor ordered glucose tolerance test and sure enough the results came back that I have insulin resistance. The doctor then put me on Metformin. I have been on Metformin for almost a year now and my dose was increased from 500mg to 1000mg a day. I am have several dry skin; my hair keeps falling off; and diarrhea. But one thing I don't understand is that since I have been on Metformin for so long; it does keep sort of regulate my period every month. But my testosterone and triglycerides are still high. Now; I have to deal with this sort of kidney pain and back pain everyday. Does anyone out there just like me? I am also hypothyroid. I am on Synthoid; Metformin and Lovaza (basic Omega-3 acid to help lower triglycerides.) If the medication does not lower my level; should I ask the doctor to look at other underlining causes?,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello Doctor; How do you distinguish between Type I and Type II ? I am a 48 year old male of Asian -Indian ancestry. I was diagnosed in my early 20s but had symptoms (increased thirst & urination ) since my late teens. Before diagnosis I may have been overweight but not obese (BMI 26) . when I started taking medication for my condition; it was one month of pills followed by insulin (aged 29). I now take 135 units of insulin every day & other medications (lissinopril; metaprolol; lipitor; Syntheroid & aspirin) for heart & thyroid related problems. I am still not sure what type I have but since i have high cholesterol & hypertension as well so I guess I may be Type II My question to you is if I am Type II then would adding metformin to my medications reduce the amount of insuln I have to take ? Thanks.,2007,2007,46,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have recently been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I just started taking the metformin and after three weeks have run into a problem. I am not sure whether I have a stomach virus; a reaction to increasing the metformin (1000mg to 1500mg) or if it was the ice cream I had but I can't stop going to the bathroom. The diarreha has been excrutiating. Any suggestions; other than I probably shouldn't have had the ice cream to begin with. Thanks from a newbie.,2007,2009,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with Type 2 last year.

My cholesterol is high so eggs are out; bagels; cereal; pancakes and french toast also push my blood sugar over 200. What's left?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Sadly I have been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes; they've put me on metformin which is making me feel quite ill. I'm glad they caught it; but disappointed as it means I will not have the normal birth I was hoping for. I was really hoping for a water birth; but they will now most likely induce me early so I give birth to 'normal' sized baby.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Recently diagnosed with Type 2. Doctor started me on Metformin (Glumetza) about a one week ago. 500MG 2x day. I'm getting some nausea that seems to continue all day and just sort of a general light headed feeling. Not dizzy per se and haven't vomited yet but it's disconcerting and not good for someone who needs to spend time outside in the sun etc. I'm just not feeling right. I'm taking it after I eat in the morning and evening and I'm really make an effort to stay hydrated. The doctor indicated this will go away after I get used to it and he said that Glumentza was actually better for his as it's extended release. But wondering if anyone else had the same problem and what your experience and suggestions are? Many Thanks.,2015,2015,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am on 4 metformin a day; 500 mg x 4. My doctor at first said take one with each meal and so eat four small meals a day. The bottle from the pharmacy says take two twice a day; no one seems to really care how I take em when I ask about this. Sometimes I seem to get metformin that are coated and sometimes they are not; have bin given three or four different brands over time and seems to be whats on the menu when I order my prescription; who knows what brand it will be next. What is better? the coated ones or non coated; is there a difference in how they work; ie; time release vs instant absorbtion and therefore a certain way to take em? Should I take two in am and two in afternoon for the day to help my blood or one per meal during the whole day? Reason I am asking is I went to a group cook-out and it was Kentucky fried chicken and lots of fresh veggies; I decided to do the right thing and ate the veggies and got sick possibly because the handler might have done something wrong where the chicken was done at the kentucky place and maybe woulda bin better luck for me; Anyway; we ate around 1 pm and around 10 pm i got sick and tossed my lunch and at the end of a violent two hour session of throwing up I could taste a chemical fishy taste and burning in my throat and back of mouth and sure enough; up came two half dissolved metformin; Why was it not absorbed and are they not supposed to be gone through the system by that length of time? I have heard about metformin causing people a bad taste and odor of fish but I never noticed it till this event with this brand and now when I open the bottle it nearly makes me sick to smell it; plus a very bad memory of that night hits me too. I hope a doctor can give me good advice on this cos I dont seem to get an answer around here from my diabetic team. This discussion is related to Drug interactions.,2010,2010,46,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My daughter has had diabetes for 10 years and has experienced significant weight gain. She has tried over the years to lose with diet and exercise but to no avail.

She is very frustrated and I don't have any answers. Unfortunately; her doctors over the years don't seem to be able to help. Should we be looking at type of insulin?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,3 months ago my Dr. put me on 500 mg Metformin. These last three months; I have worked very hard to cut carbs and loose weight. Well; I went back today; and my A1C is the same value; 6.7. I lost 9 pounds (I am still chubby at 5'4'' and 165 lb); my lipid panels had improved quite a bit (from total Cholesterol of 260 to 217) and I feel so much better than before. I am discouraged though. My Dr. says that this is just fine; as long as my A1C is under 7.0. But; somehow I was hoping that I could recover from this if I worked hard enough. I know that I can improve my health with more exercise; more weight loss. My carb intake is low (typical day would be around 350 cal of bread group type carbs; I don't count vegies or milks). I could also lower my saturated fat intake. But; I don't understand why my A1C remained the same.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My 15 year old son's doctor confirmed my son had diabetes yesterday. I'm waiting for a consult with an endocrinologist however the pediatrician was confused about my son's diabetes and I am too. Here's the issue. HUGE family history of Type II diabetes. My son is a tall (5'10"); slender (128lbs); athletic boy. He has recently been having symptoms of dizziness and fatigue (which we chalked up to all-night video game playing); eats and drinks like a horse (he's grown 6" this year); no excessive urination; and is gaining weight (8lbs in 2 months). He doesn't really fit the text-book profile of Type II (his age and he's so young and slender) or Type I (gaining 8lbs in 2 months). How do doctors determine if a teenager has Type I or Type II diabetes? As a side note; his blood sugar (checked on two different meters to ensure the readings weren't off) has bounced between 68 and 266 over the past few days. Even though he's really limited carbs today he bounced up to 185 after water; salisbury steak; and an orange at school. The doctor suggested this could be rapid onset of diabetes that we caught very early and his A1C today of 4.9 confirms that may be the case. Thank you; I appreciate the advice. I can manage my diabetes fine and my son is taking all of this in stride along with the diet change and hourly glucose readings (the pediatrician asked him to log them for the endocrinologist) but we're confused if he's headed towards insulin or metformin.,2006,2006,39,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I have told many times in the past that I am pre diabetic as my fasting blood sugars run anywhere from 107 to 118 when cked every three months. Then in January she started testing A1c levels also and said they were high (6.1; and then 6.3. but this last time my fasting level was 118 and my a1c came back 6.5. She said now I was diabetic and put me on Metformin 500 xr once a day and told me to lose weight. I forgot to mention she was concerned I gained 16 lbs within same time period (even with change of diet and exercise). I am also Hypothyroid and on Levothyroxine 115 mg.

Is there a good diet that works for people who have somewhat high blood sugar level but not at extremes that will help me lose weight.

I recently have been struggling in terms of my ketone levels jumping up the the Moderate level while have my sugar being stuck between 160-250; I typically had had my sugar go down as far as 80-90; but now it never seems to go down; even if I dont eat or do anything. I am 25 and very confused. I also have binge drank a bit over the past weekend. I wonder if that is connected? I currently do not take any drugs; I am holistic.,2009,2014,25,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am not sure if i am a type I or Type II diabetic. I am 53 yrs old and have had diabetes for 8 years. When I was first diagnosed they said it was type II and gave me oral meds. They did nothing. I finally went to the Joslin Clinic in Boston and they immediately put me on insulin which i have been on since. I always thought because of my age I was Type II but then I read somewhere if i was taking insulin I was a type I. I am so confused. Can anyone help?,2008,2008,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,The doctor has prescribed Losartan Potassium 100mg; Metoprolol Tartrate 100mg & Amlodipine Besylate 10mg all together; are all these three really needed ? There is a lot of pain in the legs; weakness & headaches since the doctor added Losartan on the list.. My dad is also taking Diabetic medication: Metformin HCL 500mg & Glyburide 5mg? Some of which were replaced for hypertension and type 2 diabetes and the usage of taking these medicines are not working the way the doctor has suggested. He is overweight so what kind of foods or nutrition plan should he follow to stay healthy with consuming so much of the various drug prescriptions.,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I know this sounds strange but where do you begin. I was diagnosis with type II diabetes fall of 2007 after I was admitted in the hopsital for chest pain. I was also put on lopresser 25mg PO BID and norvasc 5mg PO QID. The hospital didn't realize my sugar was up in the hopsital but my family doctor seen my lab results from when I was in the hospital. She started me on metformin 500mg PO BID due to my A1C being 7. I didn't like how it made me feel but continued to take it. Summer of 2008 I had surgery and my sugars dropped so I stopped taking the metformin. Advised my doctor and she left me do it as long as I would follow a diet and exercise. The only problem is she gives me this paper about carbs; calories; fat and doesn't explain it to me. Never told me to check my sugars even when she put me on metfromin. I asked my place of employment for a meter and only test once in a while due to the expense of test strips and lancets. I don't feel well; I'm always tired and seem to pick up every thing that goes around in the community. This is the second time I'm fighting an upper resp infection and it's been over a week. My family doctor put me on bactrim for it but still not feeling good. I know I need to get on track with my diabetes but don't know where to start. My doctor only wants to give me pills and pamphets. I wish someone could help me learn how to be a diabetic. I'm not sure if you know what I mean?,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I'm new to this forum; but thought I'd ask a couple of questions. I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with Type 2 Diabetes (I'm 33); and I've never really been under good control. I have been prescribed Metformin; but it always makes me so sick (Low Blood Sugar feeling as well as diarrhea) so inevitably I stop taking it. My first question is; does anyone know how long it typically takes for these side effects to subside? I want to keep taking the medication; but it's so hard when it makes me feel so sick. My second question is that recently I've noticed that my 5th toe (pinky toe) on my left foot won't move. I try to move it but can't. This understandably has me quite worried; and obviously I want to get my BS down; but with the Metformin making me so sick; I feel like it's impossible. Does anyone know what might be causing this problem with my toe? Thanks so much.,2011,2011,32,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello all. I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 moths ago. All my labs tests were normal except diabetes. I had pain under armpits on chest and thighs n groin area. My internist told me its muscular neuropathy caused by diabetes. Put me on citalopram and painkillers. My 2HR glucose was 117 and after 2hrs 170 .generally my sugar level is higher above 150 at random. I still have under arm pain and thighs pain though it has lessened now. But when it returns ;I feel bouts of anxiety and stress. I'm not on diabetes treatment. I believe I had diabetes since long. I have lipomas; when they form I'm in extreme pain. Can Neuropathy be caused by sugar levels like mine?,2013,2014,,Male

She is 42 years old and keeps landing back in the hospital with psychotic symptoms. There have been times in her life where she has functioned quite well and even worked part-time. Now; she can not take Lithium any more because she gets into toxic levels (due to the diabetes-the kidney's can't brake doen the Lithium) and whe has tried every medicine under the sun.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed as T2 about 2 years ago and began controlling by diet. Every 2-4 months; the disease has worsened and each time we change or increase the meds. I am 55. At the next increase; I am nearing the limit of metformin dosage and the last dosage implementation lasted only 70 days. I am not and never have been obese; have 100/60 blood pressure; exercise 5 days a week (for the last 10 years) and have healthy cholesterol levels. I have a number of food allergies and control my diet very stringently. No history of T1 or T2 in my family. I had my Dr. test for antibodies about a year ago and all were negative. So; why is my diabetes worsening against this evidence?! I expect to start insulin in less than 12 months at this rate. Any thoughts; explainations; similar experiences or wise medical observations would be greatly valued.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I kind of have a handful of question.. I am T2. diagnosed jan. 2014 I have gotten off insulin and now am down to 3pills - metformin a day soon to be 2! :) my husband and I are talking about having a child. I have ben doing all kinds or research but I cant seem to find any answers to theses questions hope some one here can help me;.... has anyone (preferably females) with t2. had any kids? (I know some one some where has!) do you have to go back to shots? if I can get off the meds altogether before getting pregnant; then will I have to start them again when I get pregnant? is it possible to have a vaginal delivery? will my child be born with diabetes? I know it is likely that they will at some point get diabetes; I wonder if it will be from birth or a very young age? is metformin safe to take during pregnancy? is it possible to keep your numbers under control during pregnancy? is there anything you couldn't find online or that no one told you abut t2 and pregnancy that you wish you knew before you got pregnant? if so please do share! thank you for all your help; tips and advice!! thank you! :),2014,2014,27,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My son; 18; has just been diagnosed with having Mild Diabetes; with A1C of 6.3; and daily glucose readings 70s through 80s. The doc has prescribed Metformin. My son is not overweight; and has always been very health-conscious; so we are stumped by this finding. Is there anything else that can mimic diabetes? We are trying to figure if it would be possible for him to get on a rigorous exercise program; along with meticulous dietary regimen; and if that will make a difference. It is just so weird because he does not manifest the typical signs and symptoms of diabetes; except for the findings of these tests. My husband does have diabetes type 2 which started when he was in in forties. There is no one in the history of the family who has had diabetes at such a young age. Any thoughts?,2008,2008,,

And; about years ago I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and perscribed 1- 10 mg tablet a day of Lipitor for treatment. I've since been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed 1 - 1000 mg tablet twice a day of Metformin for treatment. For the past several years; I've been focused on lossing weight with little results. The things that I'm doing routinely are: 1) reduced intake of processed carbs; 2) walk for 45 minutes 3 to 4 times a week coulped with a 15 minute exercise. Are there naturalistic treatments that can reverse and/or cure high cholesterol and diabetes? Can the medicines be hindering my ability to loss weight? What else should I be doing?,2013,2013,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,my husband (60) has Type II diabetes; high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are being managed very well by Lipitor; Lisenpril; Actos and Metformin. Before he was diagnosed (2004) we enjoyed Ecstasy maybe once every 1 or 2 yrs. It was an amazing experience for both of us; our relationship; our communication. As older adults we managed the experience (reliable source for E; hydration; calm location) carefully and respectfully. We'd love to do it again once or twice; but can't seem to get any information about drug interactions; so given his drugs - can you see any immediate danger?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello...in 2008 I had a gastric bypass. I was so excited about the possiblity of being "cured" of my type 2 diabetes....but at no time; even during the phase where i was on all liquids and immediately after my surgery while i was in the hospital did my glucose numbers drop...they were even higher in some instances. I didn't lose that much weight either in the first phase post op. I think I may have dropped about 20 lbs the first month after my bypass. My family physician said he didn't really understand how i didn't react better to the surgery. I am 60 years old on disabilty for COPD (not dependent on O2 ) but still am limited to how I can exercise though. Has anyone had this experience? Especially because of all the news of how this could be the standard to treat diabetes reports on the evening news...i am really upset and somewhat depressed. Has anyone had the same results as myself or have an idea why i reacted this way? The best thing that happened to me is that I am on Januvia (added to Lantus; metformin regimen) thats a good thing!!,2006,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Some background first. I am 41; Male; Indian. Vegetarian (eggs occasionally); alcohol 3-4 times a year; non-smoker; refrain from junk food; sodas & fruit juices. BMI of 22; though not athletic. I was diagnosed with Vit B12 deficiency around 2010 - level was around 96 or so. I was given 1000 mcg orally. After about 2 months the level did not rise significantly so I was asked to take injections. I delayed and took injections in early 2012. The dosage was daily for a week; weekly for a month; and monthly 2 months. The B12 level increased at that time. Now to 7 March 2014. I went for a routine health checkup (complete blood count; lipid profile; fasting blood sugar; liver function test; HBA1c; EKG); & also B12 test. B12 level came to 122 pg/ml (normal marked is 180-914). So evidently I am deficient in B12. And my symptoms of tiredness; lack of focus; disturbed sleep; etc. are back. In the Lipid profile; Total Cholesterol; Tryglycerides; HDL; VLDL and Cholesterol to HDL ratio are all within the mentioned normal range; but LDL is 116 with a normal range mentioned of “<100″. Liver function test parameters are all mentioned within normal range. But yesterday for the first time my Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) was above the normal level 133 mg/dL (normal mentioned as 70-100) with HBA1c at 6.7%. On 08-Mar I went to another lab and repeated both tests. FBS was 108 while HBA1c is still showing as 6.7%. The last time I did a health checkup was in Jan 2012. Fasting was 90 and HBA1c was 5.7%. The doctor whom I met on 07-Mar was seeing me for the first time. He has prescribed Metformin 500mg once daily; telling me that I have Type 2 Diabetes. The questions I have are: 1. Is it the B-12 deficiency & not diabetes that is causing high HBA1C? 2. Given B12 deficiency; should I start Metformin (I have read that it can cause severe B12 deficiency); or should I first try with diet control; exercise and a repeat course of B12 injections? Thanks in advance.,2008,2014,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My father has had psoriasis for the past 15 years. He uses topical steroids.( triamcinalone) Two years later he developed Diabetes type 2 ( runs in the family-his mother suffered from it.) He is on Metformin; Pioglitazone 15 mg once a day; Glyburide 10mg two times a day; Lisinopril 10mg once a day; and Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10mg/80 mgs once in the evening. Using the Glucometer at home he checks his glucose regularly but it fluctuates greatly. On days where he does strenous exercise ( yard work) it goes to 70g/dL and when he completely does not exercise it can go to 220mg/dL. But most days it's around 120mg/dL He exercises 4 days a week on the treadmill. He has a comparatively normal lunch; but a very small dinner. He drinks 2% fat milk 1 glass. He eats veggie esp. for dinner. He is very good about not eating sweets; cakes; and certain fruits. However he has a very stressful high profile job and has been living by himself for the past 5 years. He has to frequently fly. He has had central obesity since his mid 30s (and his limbs are also lean) and we first noticed that his upper back near the nape of the neck has enlarged. He has complained of problems in getting a full nights sleep and subsequently told he has sleep apnea and needs a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine at night. Now he also complains of dull aching pain near the right upper thigh. Recently he went in to the Dctors office about the controversy over the Avandia and his Pioglitazone for which he wanted changed to another appropriate drug. His doctor said that he must continue the drug and that if he stopped he would then have to move to insulin. ( That's definately not something we want.) He had his blood test done and his TSH is high. His reports as of July 2007; Result Normal LIPIDS: HDL 34ml/dL > 40 Triglycerides 185mg/dL <199 Total Cholesterol 131mg/dL LDL 60mg/dL Creatinine with GFR Kidney Creatinine 0.87mg/dL 60 mL/ min > 60 Urine MicroAlb Albumin/ creat ratio 3.3ug/mg 0.0-29.9 Muscle enzyme (CK) 49U/L 0-200 Fasting glucose 113mg/dL 60-99 Potassium 4.2mEq/L 3.5-5.3 ALT ( liver) 20U/L <36 TSH 6.4uIU/mL 0.2-5.5 HGBA1c 7.7% 4.6-6.0 Questions: 1. How is the thyroid related to this disease process? is it due to the drugs e.g ADR; interactions 2. What else should I do to better help him? 3. Is the steroids for psoriasis causing all these problems? Can I just have it apply when it gets worse? I really am very confused. I would be very indebted to you if you would answer these Qs. Thank You,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Our 38-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a few weeks ago. Of course; my husband and I are very upset and shocked since she was always extremely healthy until recently. She also has been very moody and irritable. We were hoping that starting insulin injections would help relieve the moodiness; but it seems to have continued; even though her sugar levels have been kept under control. Is this a common occurence at the beginning phases of Type 1 diabetes? We so much want to help our daughter--and to relieve our own anxiety-- but she seems not to like our asking her about her health or making any suggestions. We are also concerned about our two little grandsons. How likely are they to develop Juvenile Diabetes?Thanks so much in advance for your kindness and patience.,2004,2004,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,How do diabetics lose weight? Is it slower than normal people? I also have an autoimmune disease (mixed connective tissue disorder). I was normal weight a little over 2 years ago before getting pregnant and got gestational diabetes and gained 90 pounds while pregnant. That turned in to type II diabetes after I delivered; and I feel like I'm stuck at too high of a weight right now (just over 200 pounds at 5'5"). I have taken a little off since being on metformin; about 5 pounds in 6 weeks. Is it just going to take a while? Can my doctor recommend a weight loss medication since I have diabetes? She was reluctant to even talk about it with me and said I needed to focus on getting healthy instead of getting thinner right now; and focus on getting my autoimmune disease a little more under control. But; isn't staying fat not healthy either? My blood sugar levels are controlled well with metformin and low carb dieting. How low carb can I go? I am eating about 12 carb choices per day; with a caloric intake of around 1400 calories; with high fiber. It is hard to exercise in winter and I can't afford a gym membership with all my medication copays; plus I have a 2 year old with autism who has therapy 4 times per week plus it is just tired mommying. Is exercise essential for diabetics; or can you lose weight without the exercise? Is stress bad for diabetics? I notice when I get really really stressed; my blood sugar levels go higher quite a bit; even if I've eaten not many carbs. I realize there are a lot of questions I have. I just have not been able to ask my doctor everything because I had so many other questions for her to answer and there's only a certain amount of time they have to see you during the visit. Right now I am not seeing an endocrinologist for my diabetes; just my primary care physician and my rhumatologist.,2007,2008,107,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone. I'm new to this forum. I've had diabetes type II for 4 years but only recently got the wake up call to take care of it when my blood sugars hit 300 and I was having a hard time staying awake. Up until 3 weeks ago; I was taking 750 mg of metformin ER once a day and a ridiculously high carb diet...everything that is bad for me. 3 weeks ago; I radically changed my eating. I now only eat proteins; vegetables and low sugar fruits. I drink unsweetened iced tea and water. For 2 weeks I was on 1000 mg of metformin ER per day; and for the last 3 days I've been on 1500 mg of metformin per day. I'm also taking Lantus 12 units per day. I definitely have the dawn phenomenon because my fasting blood sugars are now between 160 and 180 (used to be around 250). After I eat in the morning; it's around 150. Throughout the day it wavers between 120 and 170-180. By the time I go to bed; it's back up to the high end again; despite the low carb nature of my diet. If I do eat something that's sweeter; like a nectarine versus an apple; it really sends my blood sugar up; so I know that low carbing it is what works for me. So in spite of all the changes; my blood sugar is not yet at a normal level AND I have only lost 4 pounds. With such a dramatic lowering of my calorie intake; I am surprised that is all I've lost. So my question is 2-fold: Did you find that your new way of eating took a while to kick in terms of weight loss and evening out of your blood sugar? Did you find the same thing if you are on metformin ER and/or Lantus? Could it be that because I'm not evened out yet that my body is still making too much insulin and therefore my body is still holding on to fat? I'm confused; and I'm getting really frustrated that this is not kicking in faster. I am about to start a water aerobics class. Though I am only 41 years old; I also have MS and autoimmune arthritis with a leg that does not allow me to walk or bike; so I'm getting back into the water. I know that exercise will also help. I'm still interested in your answers to what your experience is with the above. Thanks! Jayson,2009,2009,41,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I routinely have blood sugars in the 150 range my A!C has been 7.7 and 8.2. I was suppose to have some foot surgery; but it was cancel because of the A1c. It is the 1st time I was told I couldn't have surgery because of the diabetes. My regular doctor signed off on me having surgery. The foot surgeon wouldn't do it. I just didn't think my blood sugar level was of any concern.,2008,2012,50,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am a 40 year old male who; and have been fit and healthy until a few years ago. I started getting pains in my stomach and back (right side) and down the front of my right leg; no pressure when urinating; and feeling generally unwell (sick; dizzy). I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last year and have been on metformin for about 2 years. This has controlled the blood sugar levels but all the symptoms are still present. My doctor has taken blood and urine tests; all of which have come back clear. I have been to a urologist and had an ultrasound on my bladder and prostate and all is OK there. I now also have a perminant rash on the glands of my penis; which my doctor tells me it thrush; but no creams clear it up. I would be forever greatful if you could give me some advice to what is wrong with me.,2011,2011,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all. I've posted about this a few times so I'm sorry if it seems repetitive; but I have my appointment with my RE today and am trying to figure out what I should do. Once again; I have polycystic looking ovaries (which my RE claims is normal and probably good; but I don't really believe as I have long cycles; unpredicatable and 3 miscarriages at 24 years old); no insulin resistance or elevated male hormones. I am also not overweight. As long as I have no large cyst I'm going to start clomid soon; but should I push for Metformin? WIll it really decrease my chance of miscarriage? I just don't want to have another one. Does it have horrible side effects? WIll it hurt if it turns out I didn't need it at all? Also; it's a cat B and not considered totally safe for pregnancy use though I know people take it. I just need to consider the risks. Thank you!,2006,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 5 years ago. I was placed on avandamet; but was changed to metformin and avandia when they stopped manufacturing it. My blood sugar started flip-flopping and got so bad that it was dropping into the 20's and 30's. I got my gp to send me to an endocrinologist and he did a lot of test (including two seperate stimulation tests). He said my body was producing no growth hormone and no steroids. He placed me on both and I have been taking them for over a year. During this year I have gained 30 pounds; my stomach is hard as are the muscles in my shoulders. I have constant back pain and my blood sugar is once again fluctuating from the 30's to the 300's. The endocrinologist wrote down a diagnosis of Addison's disease. I have read all about it; and think it could be the answer. My problem is with the fluctuating sugar levels and weight gain and muscle tightness shouldn't another stim test be done to make sure I still need the growth hormone and steroids. I also have multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Since all of these are autoimmune diseases should my adrenal and pituitary glands be checked out? I have been to numerous specialists and it seems they all find something within their specialty; give me medicine for it and think that's it. Is there such a doctor as a diagnostician that can take everything wrong with me and tell me what is wrong? I was also diagnosed with celiac's disease and vitamin d deficiency. I am desperate to find an answer. I am worried about continuing on the growth hormone because I have heard it causes cancer to grow at an accelerated rate. I don't have cancer now; but did in 1976 *(cervical). I feel like I am dying and they will find out what is wrong with me after I'm dead. If you have any suggestions; please reply. Thanks.,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm still new to diabetes type 2. Within a year as I know; my liver enzymes have elevated. My stomach has lost of contraction. I don't know it affected my heart or my heart affected other organs. Very confusing! 1. I took half a tablet of MiniDiab if I ate a little large meal or sweet food. Metformin not work at all and it makes me SOB. Now my stomach is a bit lazy (hugh bloating stomach). It didn't contract as it should be. I took the MiniDiab which it didn't work straight away. Well; after 4 hours it worked then I was shaking and floppy. I took a bar of chocolate and it still shakes. Because it shakes; dizzy and floppy then I'm panic. (I'm afraid I can't drive home) I keep taking sweets then I end up later in high sugar (after about 4 hours)! How do I adjust it? 2. I'm always dizzy (like walking inside the spaceship) Floating! The vision is blurr. I wonder is blood sugar too high or too low with this kind of symptoms? While I'm at home; I tested... Sometime it was just after meal (slightly higher). Sometime it comes while I wake up and my heart was running like a train. Sometime it comes when I was hungry. OR it got nothing to do with diabetes? 3. What is the diabetes Dr can do or should help me other than she prescribes the medications and give script to do blood tests? Thanks for looking at my post. I wasn't sure there were enough information for you to look into my case. I always can write back and provide more details if you need to.,2005,2007,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I recently was diagnosed with Type II and so I am trying to understand testing. The way I found out - the company I work for did a trial biometric screening because the insurance company is going to charge a surcharge if you fail during the real testing in the fall. My fasting result was 135 so my doctor administered an A1C test and it was 6.5% which I guess is right on the edge? Well; I have been testing every morning per doctor's instructions and it ranges from 112 to 132. Today I tested when I woke up (112); after breakfast of an English muffin and a hard boiled egg (176) then again after lunch of a turkey sandwich (198). No snacks; only water to drink. So; I am guessing I had too many carbs? Each test was 2hrs after I ate. Anyway - just looking for info about testing and what to expect. Thanx! :o),2011,2013,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This is the first study showing that taking insulin sensitizers (like Metformin) to decrease INSULIN RESISTANCE; increases SVR. I have waited a long; long time for this study. Now we can use this study to get doctors to test people for insulin resistance and prescribe Metformin. Success rate is about to go up.....yes!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have not been diagnosed with Diabetes. For about the past year or so; I have been a lot less active than I usually am and as a result I've put on some weight. I wouldn't consider myself very over weight; but I do need to get back into exercising and eating right; which I have started to do recently. I've been doing a little research on the signs of diabetes; but they don't seem to be very clear. I've read things like: Being more thirsty and urinating more. Also fatigue. I'm a somewhat lazy person and I feel tired sometimes; but I am being too hasty to think that this could be Diabetes? I drink a lot of water; not because I'm necessarily more thirsty; but because I like to be well hydrated; but as a result I urinate more; which would be excepted. Are there any more specific signs that I could look for? And is exercising less for roughly a year so a long enough time to develop Diabetes? Or am I simply being paranoid? Also; if I am starting to develop it; can I reverse this by starting to eat right and exercise? Sorry I can't give more description; but it seems like most of the early symptoms of Diabetes are things that most people deal with every once and awhile. Thanks.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My wife will be seeing our doctor tomorrow (11-21-07) He's going to discuss with her starting tx. My wife is Type 1; Stage 4 and her Viral Load is over 2 million. She also has high blood pressure and diabetes. Does anyone have any advice for us? Will diabetes make tx harder for her and should she do different things during tx?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi Everyone; Well my hubby has been dx'ed with diabetes. He had been having excessive thirt; URGENT urination; and had lost 12 lbs without even trying. I kinda knew what it was before we even went to the doc; so I prepared him for it. Basically; nobody likes to be dx'ed with anything; but this is not too bad. It just means that our eating habit must change for the better; I have to stop whining to go out to eat all the time for a while; and he HAS to start taking daily walks with me; as I have been begging him to do forever :) As long as he keeps his blood sugar under control; I think he'll be fine. But I do have a lot of learning to do. I did a quick search online and found a couple articles linking hep c infection to diabetes type 2; which is what my hubby has. My questions are; has anyone else been dx'ed with diabetes 2; and do you have any advice for us? And; had anyone tx'ed for hep c with diabetes? Are there any special complications? Thanks! -Dee,2007,2008,38,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello. I am a 32 year old woman that has PCOS. I was diagnosed around 11 years ago. I was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago. My Dr. put me on Actos plus Met and I started having a regular period immediatly. I was amazed to find out that after 3 months I brought my A1C test results down from 13.8 to 7.8. My Dr. was amazed at this. I have never ovulated as far as I know and my Dr. seems to think since I started having a regular period I should start ovulating any time now. Me and my husband are trying to conceive. I have been taking at home ovulation predictor tests but so far I have had no positive results. Has anyone started ovulating after taking Metformin with your PCOS? And how long did it take? Maybe I'm worrying for nothing and just haven't given it long enough. Thanks for any help.,2009,2009,32,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I went on insulin two months ago. I have early kidney disease and diabetic neuropathy. My ankles and feet are so swollen I can't find shoes. My feet and ankles sometimes hurt so bad I can't sleep or walk. I am on Lyrica for fibromyalgia and it makes the swelling worse.My blood sugar is coming down slowly with the insulin.I was put on another blood pressure pill but it made the swelling worse. I take Lisinopril and a water pill and am trying another new pill. My blood is still high. I wonder if I should go off the Lyrica? I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 40 years ago. I have lumps in all the adipose tissue on my body. They are extremely painful and I have bands of them everywhere. My hips and lower back hurt so bad I can't walk more than a few steps. Some of the lumps are so big that you can see them like on the back of my neck. If you press on me anywhere you can feel them.I think that I have Dercum's but my rheumatologist said he has never seen a case of Dercum's. I have Sjogren's and IBS and migrains. I have to drink water all the time and still feel dehydrated. I have gained 100 pounds in the last five years. It hurts so much to do anything that I don't exercise. I had to quit working and am 62 and on Social Security.I have sciatica so bad I can hardly sit upright and lots of lumps in my lower back and buttocks. Do other people with fibromyalgia have lumps? This is the one question I would love to have answered. I of course have all the pressure points associated with fibromyalgia but also I have lumps from little to as big as walnuts in all of my fat especially around my joints and rib cage.I don't feel up to working on my diabetes as I am in so much pain from the fibromyalgia or Dercum's.,2007,2007,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Does anyone know what type of reaction one is likely to get by mixing Metformin and Victoza with meds for Hep C? These are non insulin meds. I am particularly interested in the interaction with Victoza which is a good stabilizer. Both of these meds can cause some stomach distress.,2011,2011,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just wanted to continue to post and diatbetes and hep c into sunday. I have read here more then once of someone who had diabetes treated for hep c and then there diabetes cleared. sounds to good to be true although I hope it is. Does anyone have any links to share about studies in regards to diabetes and hep c. I asked by by diabetes docotor and my hep c doctor about a link between the two diseases and both said there wasn't one. Since I am not over weight and there is no diabetes in my family I am inclined to think there is a link. Also have read here more then once about those of us who crave sugar while on tx; a side effect I have been going through and giving into recently; not good for my diabetes. love to hear others on this subject,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I went in for a physical 3 weeks and found out that my A1C was 10.7! They immediately put me on metformin and I have changed my diet. I use to be a heavy drinker (like 5-10 a day) and ate very horribly. It has been about 3 weeks and I have cutout all alcohol; sugar; and white bread. I started exercising everyday and have felt so much better. I recently just tested my blood glucose levels and I'm averaging 120-130. When I first measured my blood glucose it was near 300. Has anyone been able to get of medication and how long did it take? Thanks for any advice anyone has to offer. I cannot get in to see a specialist for another month.,2017,2017,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I do not have a thyroid. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced diabetes insipidus? The reason for the test is because I have been extremely thirsty and urinating almost every 1.5 hours a day. I received a copy of the test results. They tested my ADH level (arginine vasopressin) The results are L<1.0 Range:1.0-13.3 They say there are different types of diabetes insipidus; basically that the kidneys are not doing what they are supposed to do or a pituitary issue. Has anyone experienced this or have any advice? Also; my thyroid levels are actually very good and I feel they are where they need to be. (Taking 1 grain Naturethroid and 50 mcg levothyroxine everyday) I haven't heard back from the doctor since they were just finalized yesterday. From looking this up; I may need further testing to rule out exactly what is going on? -Osmolality; elecrolytes; water deprivation test; MRI to show pituitary?,2010,2013,28,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mother (75yrs) goes in for a bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection tomorrow morning (July 17th) ; it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently. Presently her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency?,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I JUST WENT TO A NEW ENDOCRINOLOGIST- HE WANTS ME TO GO ON GLUCOPHAGE SO I DON'T NEED MORE INSULIN AND TO PREVENT ME FROM GAINING WEIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT GLUCOPHAGE WORKS ON YOUR LIVER AND PREVENTS IT FROM RELEASING GLYCOGEN-WOULDN'T THAT BE DANGEROUS FOR ME IF I NEEDED THE GLYCOGEN DURING A POTENTIALLY BAD EPSIODE OF HYPOGLYCEMIA? I HAVE ALSO BEEN TAKING AN ACE INHIBITOR FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS (WITHOUT PROBLEMS) TO PREVENT RENAL HYPERTENSION (I HAVE HAD TYPE 1 FOR 23 YEARS) AND THE DR. TOLD ME I DIDN'T NEED IT AND TO DISCONTINUE ANY ACE INHIBITORS. HE'S MAKING ME NERVOUS- AM I WRONG FOR QUESTIONING HIM AND LOOKING AGAIN FOR A NEW ENDOCRINOLOGIST?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My doctor told me I've had problems losing weight the last couple years (haven't lost any really) because of PCOS (something about polycystic ovarian something or other) and because of my diabetes and insulin resistance. I can't take stuff that would speed up my metabolism or diet pills because I also have an autoimmune disease (mixed connective tissue disorder) and the doctor is afraid it might mess up my thyroid function or something so won't prescribe any weight loss medication. Being on metformin for my diabetes I have dropped about 6 pounds in the last 6 weeks; since my blood sugar levels are more under control. That's a lot better than before. Is it just going to take a long time? So; I am if weight watchers won't take the weight off (not to mention throwing my money away every week having done that); what type of diet will work? I can't do too low carb; but I have cut the carbs way down because of the diabetes; but don't know how far to push it. So; I'm a little over 200 pounds and am 5'5". And what kind of low impact exercise is good if you have joint issues? I am only 34; but with my health issues sometimes I feel like I'm more like 80 or 90. I gained 90 pounds being pregnant (gestational diabetes which turned in to full blown diabetes) two years ago; and before that; I was normal weight. I have been watching calories the last two years; maintaining a diet of around 1200 to 1400 calories; but the doctor said that caloric intake with the insulin resistance thing was not going to help me; it's the carbs. So; how do you do a South Beach or Zone type diet with getting enough to have energy to chase after a 2 year old with boundless energy and not pass out? Well; I guess before when I was normal weight; I was eating too many carbs and sugar heavy stuff; so I guess it's better I had a wake up call gaining 90 pounds during my pregnancy to get me to start eating healthier. And even though I am overweight; I am eating healthier now than I was 2 to 3 years ago. But; it's still depressing to be 80 pounds or so overweight.,2007,2008,107,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My height is 5;6" and I had been maintaining my weight between 55 kg; to 59 kg for the last 10 years. Its looks to me that I am losing my fat and muscles after being on metformin and asprin which I started in November 2004. I had been on Synthroid on last 18 years and lipitor (10 mg) for last 4 years. The dose of metformin is 300mg; 1 tablet 3 times a day. Synthroid is 125 (micro-mg) 1 tablet a day. I take my Synthroid early in the morning and metmorphin after meals and lipitor in the night. It looks like for the last 3-4 months my weight has come to 55kg. I think last year my weight was 59kg. So what could be the reason for my weight loss? I walk everyday; my diet is good and healthy; my times for eating meals are very much on time; I am a strict vegetarian; milk; once a week tofu are the main sources of protiens. There are almonds; veggies; and fruits are included in my diet. Though my own business needs a lot of physical work too; but has been for 10 years. So what is the reason for my weight loss. I am really worried. I dont feel tired. Could you please answer me as soon as possible. Thank you. -Worried wife and me,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Last week I had my 2nd miscarriage and my OB seems to think I am insulin resistant and that could be causing hormonal imbalances that lead to miscarriage.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi - I have just found out that I am insulin resistant - I am obese; hypertensive(on Cardura 1mg and Amiloride 5 mg daily) and only have one kidney due to renal cell ca. My TC is 216; LDL 112; HDL 68 and Trig. 138; CRP 3.5; Homo 11.8. I am on folic acid 800 mcg per day. I am now exercising 1/2 hr on treadmill and starting to add some resistance training and of course watching my diet to lose weight. My PC dr started me on Lipitor 40 mg and took me off my Vivelle (ERT) patch. I am miserable - I ache all over and feel terrible. I am 54 yo; menopausal symptoms are returning - sweats; insomnia; nervousness besides the side effects of the Lipitor. I have no family history of heart disease or diabetes. Do you think it is possible to control the glucose - which runs between 100-126 and the lipids by diet and exercise alone? Are there any other options besides statins that can help? Is it absolutely necessary to do without the estrogen patch? I am concerned about my cardiac health but also quality of life.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi forum members. I'm new to the site & hope that some of you might help enlighten me as I'm feeling pretty much alone about now. I'm 47; caucasian male; weigh around 118 kg; smoke 20 a day and 188cm. I've just found out I've got cirrohsis & about 6 months ago earlier that I have diabetes type 2 which I have under dietary control & so far so good - I've read diabetes medications are a big no no for compromised livers. I've had hcv since around 1984 I guess; making it some 25 years. I found out about the hcv around 1999 & had first treatment of rbavirin and interferon in 2000 and at that time was told after biopsy that I was a stage 2. I was a breakthrough after 48 weeks. Life went on and in 2005 I managed to get onto a Pegasys treatment (full dose - I think 800mg peginterferon and 1200mg ribavirin) at the time I weighed around 138kg. I broke through again after 12weeks and my specialist thought it best I stop to avoid any build up of immunity to the interferon therapy in case I got another chance at treatment. I tolerated both treatments pretty well. Anyway; again life went on and late last year (2008) after finding out I had type 2 diabetes (I found out as I was feeling pretty poorly - typical symptoms) my doctor noticed a low platelet count around 120 & thought I better touch base with my specialist. I did & new biopsy was ordered (more fun!). Now biobsy says cirrohsis & specialist (registrar) says lose weight (ie at least 20kg) in next three months & maybe you'll get a third treatment of peginterferon. All good & well; I think I can do the weight thing - believe me I'm motivated. What i can't work out at this stage is (and given my luck; I probably won't get the third chance & if I do I suspect I'll just breakthrough again anyway) is how much time do I have left? The registrar kind of dodged the question but said worst case scenario might be we are talking about a liver transplant in 5 years time! Does this sound about right? I've progressed from stage 2 to cirrohsis in 9 years. Is that as good as it gets or is the specialist being pessimistic? Anyway; all and any thoughts/ advice would be greatly appreciated.,2009,2009,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hope you can help.... I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. I take metformin for the diabetes and simvastatin for the cholesterol. Recently; (just the last few days); my ears have steadily grown in "fullness". It happens mainly at night when I lay down to sleep. Most times I just fall asleep and wake up fine. But tonight; when the fullness came on; I started feeling dizzy while laying down and that started a litlle anxiety episode and here it is 3+ hours later. So; the question is; can either of these prescriptions cause the fullness in both ears like this? Other info that might help. The weather changed here about 5 days ago from freezing and snow to just above freezing and rain. Could this just be some kind of sinus infection brought on by the change in weather? I tried holding my nostrils and mouth shut and exhaling slowly to see if it would "pop" the ears; yawning; I even sneezed a few times and nothing seems to be able to break it. I took an aspirin thinking it may be blood pressure and that didnt do the trick either; it did seem to help a little but not enough to alleviate the symptoms. At this time; I take 500-750 mg of metformin per day and 20 mg of simvastatin at bedtime. Any answers could help. Thanks in advance.,2010,2010,48,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have taken for 3 years metformin for tip 2 diabetis.I have a burning foot for 3 days.What I can do?,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. I also put a post in the Pregnancy Forum. I'm deperate for information. I found out I was pregnant with baby #3 on July 4. I had my first pre-natal exam today (July 19) and they found sugar in my urine and did a finger stick and it was 300!! I also had high blood pressure. I was unaware that I was having these problems. I thought the dizziness and headaches were pregnancy symptoms (I'm 7 weeks 3 days). My doctor didn't seemed concerned and said they'd discuss everything at my next visit when the blood work came back. However; from what I've been reading I need to get this under control NOW and not wait 3 weeks. Is it possible that my baby has already sustained damage? I have no idea how long or high my blood sugar has been getting. I'm so worried that I may have caused harm or defects to my baby without knowing. I can't believe my doctor just said to wait til I see them again in 3 weeks. Diabetes II runs in my family and I did have a problem 10 years ago with being pre-diabtetic but was fine with diet/excersice. I had no problems with my other two pregnancies. I know that I have to stop eating out and cut out all refined sugars and eat whole grain but what else can I do to control it? I don't have a monitor and can't afford one right now. I know my insurance will cover it but my doctor has to order it. I'm so frustrated. I just want to take care of this baby and I'm so afraid I've already harmed it. Please if you have any suggestions that would be great.,2008,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Pre-treating with Metformin or Avandia for 3 months before tx lowered IR and viral load and resulted in an EVR of 71%....and the patients were co-infected (more difficult to clear) and some non-responders. (from AASLD meeting Nov 2008)..... "In Chronic Hepatitis C (HCV); Pretreatment with Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or Metformin Decreases Insulin Resistance (IR) and HCV Viral Load and Increases Early Virologic Response (EVR)." M. Adler; J.L. Matloff; A.S. Boxer; H. Han; M. Vachon; D.C. Carriero; D.T. Dieterich; ; Mount Sinai School of Medicine; New York; NY; M. Vachon; D.C. Carriero; D.T. Dieterich; Division of Liver Diseases; Mount Sinai School of Medicine; New York; NY; Background: Chronic HCV is associated with increased incidence of insulin resistance (IR); which leads to a lower rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) following treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin (IFN + RBV). Romero-Gomez et al. reported an SVR rate of 32.8% in genotype 1-infected patients with IR (HOMA-IR > 2) compared to 60.5% in those without IR. In addition; IR is associated with increased liver fibrosis and is characterized by a higher viral load; two other independent risk factors for decreased response to treatment. A recent study showed 0/5 EVR in patients with IR who were given a TZD at initiation of IFN + RBV. It is unknown if therapeutic intervention to improve insulin sensitivity prior to anti-viral treatment increases response to HCV treatment. Aim: To evaluate the effect of treatment with TZDs or metformin on IR and viral load prior to IFN + RBV and the impact on EVR. Methods: IRB-approved; we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with chronic HCV from a liver clinic in our center. We included patients with IR treated with either metformin or a TZD for at least 3 months prior to initiating IFN+RBV. We compared HOMA-IR; HCV viral load; liver enzymes and BMI at baseline; after treatment with an insulin sensitizer (IS); and at week 12 of HCV treatment. Results: 17 patients met inclusion criteria. 10 were co-infected with HIV. The average age was 52.2 years; and 82% of patients were genotype 1. 11 patients were treatment-naïve to IFN+RBV. The mean stage of fibrosis was 2.7 on Metavir score in 12 patients. 11 patients received a TZD and 6 received metformin. The mean HOMA-IR decreased from 7.99 to 6.06 after treatment with an IS to 4.60 at 12 weeks of IFN + RBV. There was a significant mean decrease of 0.52 log in HCV viral load on each patient after treatment with an IS (p<0.01). An EVR was achieved in 12 patients (71%). The mean ALT value decreased from 86.2 at baseline to 72.5 (p=0.02) after treatment with an IS to 34.1 IU/L (p=0.01) after 12 weeks of IFN + RBV. BMI significantly decreased from 27.9 to 26.8 kg/m2 (p=0.02) following treatment with an IS. Conclusion: The use of a TZD or metformin improved insulin sensitivity prior to treatment with IFN + RBV. The baseline viral load; a risk factor for decreased response to treatment and until now referred to as an unmodifiable factor; was also significantly lowered. This intervention allowed a 71% rate of EVR in a population of mono and co-infected patients; the majority being genotype 1. This small pilot study suggests that targeting insulin resistance prior to treatment may enhance the chance of response to traditional treatment for chronic HCV. http://aasld.scientificposters.com/epsAbstract.cfm?id=3,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm having a real dilemna here; and I would really like to see more discussion of this topic. here is a great synopsis I just found: http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n9/full/nm0900_998.html WOW; that was a mouthful!! in light of the findings from all those studies listed I would think this needs much closer examination. In light of the fact that I am currently UND and have no virus; the reversal of fatty liver and less necrosis and less HCC all sounds very appealing; not to mention any reduction in IR would mean ones own Interferon response would be better post tx. and this alone may increase ones chances of an SVR even if begun at the end of an SOC regime. Perhaps now; more than any other time it could help insure one will recognize any lingering HCV and seek and destroy as designed. As long as one kept the dose low; monitored the liver; and watched for lactic acidosis; what would be the harm in trying? arguments in favor or opposed please weigh in; if obese women went from 20% to 60% SVR that should tell us something?? mb,2007,2009,57,Female

It's making my workouts more difficult due to lack I'd energy but I feel like if I eat more than that I'll be sick..,2015,2015,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I am a thin and highly active 20 year old male who was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis is weird because I've never had a poor diet; I played sports; and have little family history of the disease. I should mention though that my father has been "borderline" since the age of 12 and now he is 51 and his condition has not changed. I'm not in denial but recently I've been beginning to wonder if I truly have the disease. You see my first fasting glucose test showed that I was high but still below 100 mg/dl. So my doctor ordered glucose tolerance test. The morning of the test several things went wrong and I believe that they merit a retest. I also confess that these things were my fault. First I was massively late. They wanted me there no later than 12-14 hours of fasting when I accidentally slept in and showed up at after 15 1/2 to 16 hours of fasting. The second mistake is that I think I accidentally broke fast. You see I almost reflexively grab my huge mug of coffee every morning without thinking and that morning I did. I had the equivalent of two cups of black flavorless coffee. I am not entirely sure if that affects the exam (my doctor doesn't think so but a lot of the nurses and lab techs do). Anyways I showed up and failed. My number was 220 mg/dl 2 hours after the glucola was administered to me. So my doctor puts me on metformin 500 mg for twice a day (I was also ordered to only take 1 a day for the first two weeks). He also gave me a glucose meter. A few days later I find that I am having the easiest time in the world keeping my numbers in the normal range (at this time I had not started metformin). When I started metformin; I had an adverse reaction and was ordered to stop. A month later my averages are about 108 my fasting is 81-95 and my 2-hour postprandials are almost always below 120 unless I load up on carbs; then they can go anywhere from 125-160 and this is all without medication. Should I demand a retest?,2012,2012,19,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; My husband was diagnosed with Type 1 at age 29. Thanks to Lantus; Metformin and a very smart diet he has his numbers under control & very rarely has issues. We had our son just months before he was diagnosed and had always planned to have a second child. Now we have reservations about growing our family. What is the lieklihood that our children will inherit the disease? Would it be irresponsible to try for another child? How do other couples make this decision? Thanks; Confused Mom,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; my name is Linda; I live in Australia. I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for five years with cortisone steroid injections for the first four years. Not once did anybody bother to monitor my blood sugar levels; and I was unaware that they could be affected by them. I have recently been diagnosed with High Blood Pressure; and Type 2 Diabetes; my Doctor was aware of all the medications I was on. I was taking Prednisolone 5mg for 1 year; Diclofenac 50mg twice daily for five years; and Perindopril 8mg once daily for a month. About two weeks ago; after feeling sick from the cocktail of medications I was taking. I made a rash decision to ditch all of them except the High blood pressure medication; my blood pressure was 150/109. Since doing so I feel amazing. Four months ago I decided to change my eating habits; quit a 20 year addiction to Coke Zero and started exercising everyday about a month ago; this was very difficult to start with RA; but I already feel amazing differences in my fitness. I have gone from 315 to 292.9 pounds. Since being diagnosed on the 22nd October this year I have cut out all trans-fat products; all artificial sweeteners; and anything made from a factory. I have noticed radical improvements in my weight loss. Half of my weight loss has occurred in the last week. Getting back to my diagnosis; with my OGTT my fasting score was 126; and two hours later it was 257.4. My doctor immediately put me on Metformin 500mg twice daily. He did not discuss any attempts for me to try to manage with diet and exercise. My mother developed Diabetes 4 years ago; she lost 132 pounds and manages her diabetes well. I borrowed her level checker and have been testing myself at fasting; and 2 hours after each meal. My fasting was 108/108/113/95. My 2 hours after lunch were 104/88/91. My 2 hours after dinner were 93/108/122. I read diabetics are unable to come down to fasting levels before a three hour period. Is it possible that I was misdiagnosed? Sorry about the length of the question.,2012,2012,40,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Just watched a short clip on CNN that says based on a population based study; (whatever that is) we have an significantly increased chance of developing diabetes 2. Not a lot of meat to the article and it wasn't even specified whether it was related to interferon use or not. Now; I'm wondering if some of the symptoms I've been feeling is NOT fatigue from Hep C; but diabetes 2. I know I gained too much weight back after failing treatment in 2003; but I am still pretty active and push myself a lot to do THINGS; mow the lawn; take the stairs; etc. Does anybody else wonder about diabetes 2? Sometimes; I get a kind of dizzy feeling; sort of woozy; but it passes quickly. I watch the sugar I eat; but still have a popsicle every day. I'm working on losing 30 lbs; I lost 50 lbs during tx but gained it all back over the last three years; it was quite insidious; very slowly creeping back to my bu tt and thighs. It pops into my head that I am carrying around 30 extra 1 lb. new york strip steaks and no wonder I am freakin tired. I've upped my veges and fruit and have cut back seriously on portions. So I'm thinking I need a glucose meter; take the blood sugar now and then and see what's up. Every once in a while; I will read something that talks about "insulin-resistance" and am wondering if this is one of the gifts left to me by IFN. Anybody have any experience with this? Let me know; before I go see my GP; I need to know what to tell him. He is very scared to treat me because of his lack of knowledge about Hep C and is always grateful when I tell him what I need. Sad situation; but my infectious Doc is in Seattle; about 300 miles away. So I am on my own and I don't know about the rest of you; but since I was diagnosed with Hep C; a lot of my treatment has been in my own hands; my own research and I'm glad to do it.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've been diagnosed with PCOS recently and will start Metformin and Clomid. I've heard the chances of having a healthy pregnancy with these meds are 40% for PCOS women which isn't too bad but wish it was more like 80% : ) Just wanted to hear any success stories to help cheer me up.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Many scientists believe that diabetes can be prevented. Because the causes of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are different; approaches to preventing each form of diabetes are different. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an allergic-like reaction; probably to insulin; the pancreas; or some substance in the pancreas. If this is true; then it is likely that diabetes can be prevented by giving the vulnerable person miniature shots of insulin; a great deal like allergy; shots may avert fever. This advance has been triumphant in animals that were bred to acquire diabetes. However; this approach was not successful in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial. Other approaches; such as oral insulin; are still being investigated. Type 2 diabetes does not appear to be founded by an allergic response. The cause is probably related to a hereditary defect that reduces a person’s sensitivity to insulin. New medications used early on may avoid type 2 diabetes. In addition; lifestyle changes; including exercise and weight loss; may prevent it. The Diabetes Prevention Program has recently shown that diet and exercise prevent the incidence of diabetes by about 60%; with the oral medication; metformin; preventing about 30%.,2010,2010,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 50 year old man and have been diabetic for 5 years now; I have also been diagnosed with hypertension about a year ago. When I was diagnosed I was 5'9" and 180lbs. and in decent shape. Diabetes is rampant in my family with both my parents and half of my grandparents and plenty of my uncles and aunts are and were diabetic so I know genetics is a big factor here to. I have just started a diet and exercise regime where I'm eating less than a thousand calories a day( no starches; pasta or other high carb food only oats and lean meat and green veggies) and working out with weights for 1/2 hour the running for a half hour ( I can still bench 250 and run a 6 1/2min mile). My next A1c check is in June and I'm hoping that my A1c will be under 6 but half of this one will be before the diet started so I will be patient and also wait till the next and hopefully it will be closer to 5.5. I am on glyburide 5mg 2x a day and metformin 1000mg 2x a day and just started losartan 50mg once a day. Was taking lisinopril hctz 20-12.5 once daily but had some side effects that I didn't like. I was wondering if by doing this I could put my diabetes into remission like some of the participants in the Newcastle study did or if genetics might have me screwed. Has anybody else had any experience with being able to get off there meds with a lifestyle change. I know according to the charts I was overweight by about 12 lbs back then;I wasn't going to the gym at that time but I was far from a couch potato. I'm not sure what is causing my insulin resistance and hbp. I'm just very unhappy with how things have turned out. Turning 50 has caused me to rethink my thoughts on taking meds and winding up like my most of my relatives who take 10 or so meds daily. Three to me is three to many. I was hoping my biggest mid life crisis decision would be what type of sports car to buy not this. Any personal experiences with being able to get off meds or not would be greatly appreciated.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am on 500 mg of metformin once a day. My doctor said my a1c said above 15. I already have nerve damage and other symptoms. I want to know if this an appropriate treatment; and when i can expect my glucose to return to normal. Also they said my vitamin D levels were extremely low; is that caused by the diabetes? Also; i'm bewildered by this. But they said after my high a1c test; i got blood drawn 10 minuters later; and they said the results of that blood test is that my glucose levels were low 10 minutes later. Can anyone explain this?,2016,2016,24,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have Diabetes II. I am not overweight. I don't need insulin. Sometimes I eat too much fruit and have blood sugar of 160 three hours later. I feel hungry a lot even when I should not be hungry. I think diabetes does this to us. I am thinking about going on the HCG diet; without the injections. Would that benefit me; or should I use the injections too. I would like to her from other diabetics who have used HCG diet; with and without the injections.,2009,2009,63,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with this I guess about seven years ago. I'm at stage three. 60 years old; male. Geno type 1. Pegasus was mentioned. I haven't asked further as I wanted to review the treatments. Peg-Inton with Rebatol was mentioned as possibly more effective.. but I'm not really sure what exact treatment the Dr. talked about. 48 weeks was suggested. A 30% chance was suggested. I'm talking this over with my family doctor first; but fully expect to jump in. I have only one symptom; which is really mild. Occaisional sort of stabbing in the liver area; lasts about a few seconds.. lays way back.. may repeat one or two times.. and is over in minutes. Never hangs on. Isn't daily. sometimes I go weeks with nothing at all. 48 Weeks seems a long time.. and I'm wondering about the side effects; and how they will affect my daily life. I also wonder if the treatment of those side effects isn't also troublesome in ways I'm not aware of; drugs being what they are. How knocked around should I expect to be during this? 160 lbs; 5' 10". I am hypothryoid; but it's been perfectly managed with no trouble for 20 years. I'm also diagnosed type II diabetes; but no meds or symptoms. Diet and Exercise with some supplements has given me consistently good tests. For all these conditions; I still feel just fine every day. If I didn't know I had them; I wouldn't know I had them! Any comments appreciated.,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Does anyone know where I can get information about diabetes onset with Hep C treatment? My husband has been on PEG-Intron for 13 weeks with excellent results. Two weeks ago I rushed him to the hospital violently ill. His blood sugar was 500 and he had diabetic ketoacidocis. Last week the same thing happened only he went into diabetic shock. He was just released yesterday. There is absolutely NO diabetes in his family ANYWHERE. He is 53 and now on 4 shots a day of insulin.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,All right; I'm getting mixed messages. My glucose; serum is 117; my A1c is 6.6. I'm going to be 49-years-old in two weeks; I have been overweight and obese off and on since age 33. Last year; give or take a month or two; and before that my blood sugar has always been "normal". I ended up with high blood pressure; for the 1st time; about two years ago. I seem to be in full menopause; since October 2011. The doctor said exercise and losing weight will REVERSE my diabetes diagnosis/reading; and I will be able to go off the oral medication she is giving me? Another person said there is "no way" to reverse diabetes. My only family members with diabetes was my paternal aunt and uncle. No one else has ever had it. Thus; could it be a fluke reading? Am I curable? Should I get a 2nd opinion? The doctor didn't even tell me to test my levels or give me a particular diet to follow -- she just said I should lose weight and will be able to go off meds.,2012,2012,48,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My 6 year old grandson was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He was admitted with a blood sugar level of over 2500. After 3 days in intensive care; his CK level rose to 78;000. He tested negative for the diabetes antibody. Two days ago; after 10 days in intensive care he was moved to the regular pediatric floor however his ketones are still at 2000 and the doctors are puzzled why they keep going down then up for no apparent reason. His blood sugar levels vary (400 down to 150) based on what he eats and how much insulin he is given. Still working our the kinks in getting him stablized. Does anyone have any idea what else may be going on to cause all this? We are puzzled and concerned that he may have something else going on that is being missed.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My glucose level one hour after dinner was 260. At two hours after dinner; it was 222 (I know; I know....I shouldn't have had the pizza and popcorn). My fastings have been recently up to 118. Should I be on medication? What levels do most doctors look at when determining to put their patients on medications? I was dxed via the O.G.T.T. going on 11 years ago (I was not pregnant...it was ordered after a routine physical found my fasting at 113). Those results were: fasting 97; 1/2 hr. 220; 1 hr 218; 2 hrs 219; 3 hrs 115. I've lost 30 pounds and kept them off since then and have experienced normal levels (fastings around 97; and under 140 most of the time; sometimes over 200 depending on what I ate; and most a1c's in the 5's). Over the past 6 mos; I've had fastings up to 118. I'll be going in for a new a1c and other bloodwork soon. My last a1c in July was 6.1%. Advice would be appreciated.

Really need advice because I'm really worried and scared as to what is going on with my body! Thanks for taking the time to read the above info: This is rather long so please bare with me I'm sorry about it being so long: Here is my question I'm new to the pcos I actually just found out Wed I do indeed have pcos ; I had been seeing a ob since 2004 which at that time I had my second son the past couple of years seemed fine but my periods just went obsalete and it took me until now with the new obgyn to get answers! They did my blood work last friday and the new ob called me wed to let me know the results he said due to my insalin being up there ( excuse my typo's) he can go ahead and diagnose me with pcos ; he had put me on Provera that made my third time being on that I told him in the past it didn't help but he still insited me try it again so I am ; Well Wed he told me he would like to put me on Metformin which I just picked up last night ; I never been on this medication so I'm not really educated on this ( I hate taking any type of pills) ; So I looked it up on the net and it says its for type 2 diabetes but has been given to women with pcos so I was like ok then there was a rare condition called lactic Acidosis but apparently not common ; so that had me worried a bit ; also he has me on this for 12+ months taking this ; I didn't know that this drug was going to be taken for a long period of time; so that meaning do I have to take this for the rest of my life ? ( he didn't say anything of the sort to me ) He did say this would help me with my weight problem and I would have to becareful because I could get pregnant with this medication which we want to try for another baby but not until I lose some weight ( due to highblood pressure ) with my last pregnancy they had to induce me last time due to that;! Now here is another kicker : I was reading it said to watch my blood suger levels ( obgyn never said anything over the phone ) does that mean I have to check my blood suger everyday ? is there certain types of things I need to watch out for like food wise I don't drink beer or wine anything like that!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. My name is Summer. I am 30 years old. In November 2008 I went into the hospital with pancreatitis. I knew nothing about pancreatitis before that day but that day changed my life forever. I went into the emergency room 3 times before they finally figured out what was wrong and admitted me. Once they realized the severity of my condition they said if I had waited even 24 before getting treatment I could have died. I was there for 10 days. I spent my 30th Birthday and Thanksgiving in that hospital. I couldn't eat or drink anything for 8 of those 10 days. When I got out I was put on a low fat diet. Tricor to lower my Triglycerides and Metformin to Control my Diabetes. I went through extreme frustration and felt overwhelmed and at times I still do. I never really worried about what I ate before that so now not only watching my fat but also my sugar and carbs is very difficult. Since I've been on the low fat diet my weight has gone from 186 to 146. My family has very low income and there are periods of time where I have to go without the Tricor because we can not afford the $150 dollars a month. I started using NuvaRing in July of 2008. I started having problems of missed periods and horrible cramping pains that had never been that bad before. A few days ago I went online to try and search what could be causing these problems and if they were normal. I found this under possible side effects: In women with inherited defects of lipid metabolism; there have been reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides during estrogen therapy. This has led to pancreatitis in some cases. I stopped using the Nuvaring immediately. Never during that whole time I was in the hospital or months afterwards did any doctor link the pancreatitis to the NuvaRing. I remember having bleeding in the hospital a week early even though the ring was still in. At that time I just thought it was because of the catheter and the nurses did not think it was anything to worry about. My questions are: 1. If the Nuvaring was what was elevating my triglycerides is it possible they will go back to normal and how long after being off them should there start to be a difference? 2. Is it possible that if the Birth Control was causing elavation in my triglycerides could it also be causing my Diabetes? Thank you; Summer,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mom who is 93 and suffers from type 2 diabetes. She went into a care home five months ago weighing 9stone 4lb. Her weight has increased to 10stone l0lbs in that short time and she is very uncomfortable and breathless. Prior to her admittance into the home she was in hospital and before she was discharged the ward doctor reduced her Metformin from 2 tablets a day to one. Could this be the reason she is putting on so much weight so quickly? I am really worried; as I no longer have control over her health issues; as her GP has been changed to the practice the home has for all their residents and she has not seen this new GP since she moved in. Any suggestions; anyone?,2015,2015,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Greetings During a yearly check-up; my bloodwork showed higher than average glucose levels (7.1). I was then asked to take a GTT ( 2 hour) and the lab results came back as 10.8! My husband is a Type 2; uses insulin and has glucose monitors. They do appear to be working. So; for the past 4 weeks I have been taking morning readings and after meal readings and they are in the 4-6 range which I gather is normal. The A1c test registered 5.6. My GP is convinced I have diabetes and when I did a follow-up appointment and showed her my levels that I put on a spreadsheet; she said she didn't have time and dismissed my concerns and queries. She wanted to put me on Metformin even before the A1c. Is it possible that the first two tests were wrong? I have another appointment with a new GP who was highly recommended to me and I would like a second opinion. It is not that I am in denial; more like the lab findings and the weekly/daily readings tell me something otherwise. This is rather perplexing. Anyone else have this experience? I suppose I would rather this scenario be a proverbial wake-up call than something definitive for the time being. Thank you.,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have type 2 diabetes for about 2 1/2 years now and my medicines have been working until recently. About 2 weeks ago; my blood sugars have been higher than normal; between 200 and 400 all day. Normally they run about 70 to 200. There has not been any unusual stress; nor have I been ill; occassionaly I have eaten things I should not have or more than usual; but not excessivly. I did the same with the food around Thanksgiving and it did not affect the blood sugars like this; I had the occassional high; but not daily and all day like now. A couple of days ago I started to feel shakey; thirsty; urinating alot; nausea; headache; blurred vision; I called my Doctor and he said to go to the Emergency Room to have my urine checked. At the ER; they checked my blood sugar and it was 475; they gave me IV fluids and a shot of insulin which brought it down to 214 two hours later and down to 61 by the time I got home 6 hours later. At that time; I ate dinner and it went up to 89 after dinner; but before bed it was back up to over 200. What else can cause the sudden change in the readings being so high? I take my medicines everyday like I am supposed to. I am not on insulin.,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am concerned for my daughter in law. She has not been diagnosed with diabetes (adult) but the doctor says she is borderline and has a "marker". The doctor put her on diabetic medication anyway. I feel this is wrong and her body will become dependent on the medication so she will need it. I think she is at a point where it can be controlled by healthier options. I have mentioned this to her; she is watching her diet now and not eating a lot of sugar; but it really doesn't mean anything coming from me. I think she is being "set up" to be dependent on medication. Please give me your thoughts so I can pass them on to her. Also; is a "marker" nothing more than " other family members have had it? Thanks you for your insight. Karen,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hey; welcome to the busiest board in the group; I bet. I tried Pegasys tx in 2002 with viral breakthru at 30 weeks...lost about 40 lbs but have since gained it back. I'm going to the gym and have RADICALLY changed the way I eat......but have a question.........when NASH is combined with Hep C; how much more scared should I be as far as the condition of my liver? I'm dieting and exercising...and the pounds are going away very slowly (five pounds in two months) ; but should I be working harder? No diabetes type 2...never been a drinker....other than having hep c; i have no health issues. Are there any symptoms of NASH? My last biopsy showed something like 20%....my doc was pretty laid back about it; but he's pretty laid back about everything; so I got busy myself. Just wondering if I am on the right track; he didn't really have any advice. Willow,2006,2008,56,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,not really a question;... just wanting some opinions... I figured when she told me "all of my patients clear" ; she meant the ones that last the duration of 12 weeks with svr.... well duh... .. talk about spin. cw - I am exercising now on a treadmill that they have set up for the teachers where I teach.. even has cable tv! very cool. my glucose is still high in the morning; 110-120; even thought the metformin has been doubled and I am exercising... maybe it takes awhile? HI apache! yeah; i remember all that. I am just hoping and praying that IR is the reason I failed. As far my doctor goes... of course I am getting a new one... and am seriously thinking of trying to talk my pcp into treating me; as he is quite open to all options. I think he would probably do anything I asked as long as I can back it up with studies ; etc. It is just too hard to run around trying to find a gastro or hepa that is willing to work a little outside of the box... many seem to be content with just following standard protocol.. I guess they reluctant due to lawsuits. My liver doc does want me to come back in ; in april for an ultrasound... probably worthless; although I have had an ultrasound tech that an ultrasound will show a fatty liver as well as liver cancer. I am going to try an wait on the polymerase/protease inhibitor combos for round 2. I just don't have much faith in the infergen; or a retreatment with riba/inf. any opinons? thanks; bandman,2008,2009,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a Type 2 diabetic for 10 years and on Diamicron (4 tabs) and Metformin (3 tabs) medication daily. My glucose tests has dropped from range of 14-16 middle last year to range of 6-8 this year. Latest Hb1Ac is 6.5 done 2 weeks ago. Beginning this year; I realised I have pain on right side of my body just below the rib cage. Its like needles poking from inside my body. When I walk I feel the tightness around the area and esp after meals; but it will go away after a while. Now the pain is spreading to the other parts of the body on the right side. I find difficulty even wearing my clothes as the pain is sensitive to even my clothes. I am also suffering from erectile dysfunction. I have done ultrasound test; chest x-ray for other major organs and all is ok. I went to see a neurologist who gave me gababentin to help me to sleep as suspect could be my nerves. My neuro mentioned that could be nerve regeneration and to control my diabetes. Gabapentin is costing me a lot and I am not sure how long I need to take this med. Any other forms of help/info - like physiotherapy- to reduce this pain is appreciated. Thank you I need some information and help. Thank you.,2008,2008,,Female

(not neccesarily with exertion) It seems to happen along with pms type symptoms. Bloating; abdominal cramping; depression....and then slight spotting. I have had pelvic ultrasounds...normal; echocardiogram..normal. What could be going on? I tend to have them at the first part of the month; sometimes monthly sometimes several months apart. I am 54 and have not had a period for 8 years now. Some times it lasts for about an hour and sometimes it last for 3 to 4 hours and will be very painfull. Like very severe menstral cramps and coming on like contractions in labor. my blood pressure goes way up ..150/120 and I feel extremely tired and sweaty. Then it all just sort of goes away.

Our next appointment is Monday with our RE!!! . luvkayln ; 1 hour ago Rachjas- I had morning sickness from like 6-8 weeks; but barely...! Guess I'm getting lucky this time around; hehe! ;) I just feel completely different this time around; totally different then when I was pregnant with the girls; and I know each pregnancy is different but it just amazes me at how different each one can actually be! :) Can't wait to hear your update from your apmt on Monday! I know you're anxious to see that lil bean! ;) How are you feeling? Guesito- The baby's room is adorable! :) I'm glad the contractions have stopped; what a relief!! Wow; you're good!

As for the backaches; be careful because you could be contracting in your back (back labor); keep an eye on it. Also; be sure to tell your massage therapist of the GD and high blood pressure and contractions. Chances are (sorry!) that you will not be able to get a massage. I am a massage therapist and if you have any of those; we require a note from your OBGYN stating it's okay to recieve a massage. I'm not sure of the massage licensing laws in FL; but here in OH we are the strictest state and the hardest tested state throughout the U.S. Rest up and make sure you are drinking enough water.

We got hit by the same snow storm you guys did - except here we got at least 1-2 inches of ice. It was nasty out. Rachjas: How is the zofran working for you? I had it with DD but quit taking it when it made me sooo completely constipated (TMI sorry!). Ginger ale works really well and small amounts of carbs at a time; like toast or small bagel and such. Hope all is well and I can't wait until all the papers are finalized! trh: Almost there!!! How are you feeling? Are you getting really excited yet? I can't wait to see pictures!!! Has anyone heard from Keyan lately? The last I heard was she needed a biopsy and haven't heard anything yet... AFM: Well; Peyton turned 1 yesterday... :-( I can't believe how fast time has gone by!!! She is walking everywhere and getting into everything lol!!! She's getting so big too; she has her 1 year well check next Tuesday. Besides the ice storm we had here; we are all doing well. DH went out and bought a generator in case we lost power b/c of all the ice accumulation; but thankfully it didn't go out. We are expecting more snow this weekend and again Monday and Tuesday. Oh joy lol! I'm ready for warmer weather!!! I hope you all are doing well!! Hugs; Love and SSBD to all :-),2008,2011,25,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,by Richard Knox Most people wouldn't think diabetes and cancer have anything to do with each other. But a group of experts from the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association thinks they do. A consensus statement from that panel says there's accumulating evidence that people with diabetes are; in fact; more prone to certain cancers. The analysis is published in the latest CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. It turns out that diabetics are twice as likely to get cancer of the liver; pancreas and uterine lining. Their risk of colon; breast and bladder cancer is 20 to 50 percent higher than non-diabetics'. There doesn't seem to be any higher risk for others; such as lung cancer. And the risk of prostate cancer is actually lower among diabetics. Doctors have noticed since the 1950s that their diabetic patients seem to get cancer more often than usual. But it wasn't until last year that researchers pulled together data from various studies and found an association. Also last year; several epidemiology studies got a lot of attention when they suggested that a synthetic long-acting insulin called glargine seems to increase the risk of cancer. But that's still highly debatable. Other studies indicate that metformin; the most common drug for Type 2 diabetes; may actually reduce the risk of getting cancer or dying from it. And just how might diabetes increase the risk of cancer? On that point there's only speculation. Here are some possibilities: Shared risk factors: Both cancer and diabetes become more common as people age; gain weight; eat diets poor in fruits; vegetables and whole-grain cereals; or smoke. Men have higher risk of both diabetes and cancer. Off-kilter metabolism: Many cells in the body have surface receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factors that have been shown in the test tube to stimulate the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. About half of Type 2 diabetes and all Type 1's take insulin daily; and their blood-insulin levels spike higher than normal. Diabetic patients also have episodes of higher-than-normal blood sugar; which might promote cell cancer growth. The fat-tissue hypothesis: Being overweight and obese is the most prominent risk factor for diabetes; and scientists now know that fat tissue is like an endocrine gland; putting out a number of hormone-like substances. These might play a role in turning normal cells into cancerous ones; or promote cancer cell growth. Cancer in overfed laboratory animals behaves more aggressively. All these questions need a lot more research. But the consensus panel says it will be hard to do good human studies because the issues are so complex and lots of people would have to be followed for many years. They call for more good "observational" studies comparing cancer incidence in diabetics and nondiabetics and correlating cancer incidence with blood chemistry and different treatments. Meanwhile; the evidence so far justifies even more attention to healthy diets; weight control and physical activity among diabetics; the consensus panel says. And doctors should look carefully for any signs of early cancer in patients with diabetes. npr.org,2008,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 42 year old female with high blood pressure. I am taking hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) and benazepril (20mg). My pressure is currently under control. I also was diagnosed with diabetes but not my fasting sugar is down to 103 and 2 hours after a meal my sugar is 120. I was prescribed metformin and the dose has been cut in half since my sugars have gone down. I was originally 204lbs. and now I weigh 167; so I'm loosing weight by watching my diet and walking 5 days a week and cardio 1-2 times a week. I've recently been having chest discomfort (not pain) between the breast area and some discomfort in various parts of my arm. I sometimes feel like I have to vomit and go through the motion but nothing ever comes up. The doctor says that's symptoms from the metformin. My LDL is 87; HDL is 56; & Triglycerides are 110. My Dr. feels like everything is ok by insisted on a visit with a cardiologist. So next week I'm scheduled for a strees test. My concern is that there could be something wrong with my heart. I'm concerned that this could be the begining stages of a heart attack. Oh; I've been battling panic attacks on and off for the last 3 years.,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello all; I am just writing to get aquainted with PCOS. I have a Prolactin Producing Pituitary Tumor; Hashimotos Thyroid; Type 2 diabetes; Depression; High Blood Pressure; and now apparently PCOS... My dr. has been testing for Cushing's but has decided PCOS to be more probable. I have always dealt with endometriosis and cysts. I was on birth control for 2 years and my symptoms decreased; but I gained a lot of weight. (40 lbs) Since beginning treatment for the tumor and thyroid condition I had ceased the medication I was on for Diabetes and just been controlling it with diet and exercise. (I was started on Metformin and switched to Janumet). My dr. has suggested I go back on Metformin for weight loss; regulate my periods and help with unwanted hair growth that has begun. Any suggestions; tips or other would be appreciated. PS. I have a 7 year old son from my first marriage. I am 30 and my husband and I started trying for a baby about 6 months ago.,2008,2009,30,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had a question...I resently have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was put on Metfomin; 500mg 2 times a day. And so far I don't feel like it has helped me at all. The side effects that I got from Metformin have not gone away yet; I still have nausea; I'm never hungry; and to top it all off my BG levels are still very high even with my diet.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Is there a relationship between untreated insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes and hyper-acidity resulting in a bloated stomach causing breathlessness and tachycardia?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes; 7 years ago; while pregnant with my son. I continued to have problems after the pregnancy and was told by all who tested me that I was a type 2 diabetic. For nearly 7 years; I lived believing that I was diabetic; testing my daily sugars; attemping ot make healthy eating choices (that was not easy for me); and exercising as much as my schedule would allow. I moved from one city to another. I told my new health care phsycian about my condition. She did a work up on my blood; etc. As I was getting ready to ask her for the prescription that would allow my diabetic supplies to be covered under my health insurance...She tells me that I never had diabetes; and then prescribed two months worth of metformin. I have never been on ANY type of diabetic pill or insulin either before or after that. When my test results arrived back at her office. She said I was fine except there were traces of protein in my urine. Since going off my somewhat healthy diet; I've experienced..mood swings; a rash (that was common when my sugars were off the charts); fatigue; lathargic;etc. I relaize that those may all be symptoms of just not eating right and exercising... But should I have cause to worry about this Doc's Diagnosis? She is supposedly a Specialist in the field of Diabetes... My sugar tests are recently around 150 and have been as high as 185 to 195. Is there cause for alarm? I sometimes sleep immediately after a meal; experience dizziness; wake in the middle of the night and lose feeling to my hands. Thanks; TAZ,2004,2004,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 22 years old. In the beginning; I used insulin for almost 3 years. Then I realized I can control it with oral drugs; so I changed insuline to actoplus and metformin 15/850 twice a day. Now; my A1C has been keeping at range 5.8-6.2 for the past 2 years. I read some paper about MODY a few days ago. Now I am worrying about if I have MODY. I am 29 now. I am the only one with diabetes in my family history. I am overweighted and my BMI is 2.75. Both actoplus and metformin work very well for me. Will you please give me any advice if I should go to do MODY tests? Thank you for your any help.,2011,2011,29,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I`ve lost 30 pounds in the last 3 months without wanting to. I`ve just been diagnosed diabetic type 2; but unlike most diabetics who are trying to lose weight; I want to STOP losing weight; mainly because a lot of it is muscle - don`t mind the fat going; but I want to keep the muscle :-) My new meter shows my blood sugar levels are pretty high (average about 450 or 27-ish; tho` have been off the scale of the meter once or twice.. So I have to watch the carbs; but is there any reason why I should not start eating a lot more meat to stop losing muscle? losing 4" off thighs and 3" off biceps is no fun. Any other suggestions? As I understand it my insulin is ok at the moment but my body is not communicating with my blood and not taking nourishment from it. I`m 200 pounds now (over 6 foot) Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I don`t see a type 2 diabetes forum.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Several months ago during some routine testing the doctor said my insulin level was too high. On the report it did not show outside the normal but she said the usually accepted cut off for insulin resistance was lower than my level. I was placed on 500mg metformin; told to cut out process/refined sugar; carbs; and be re-tested. This process has continued and now I am on 2000 mg of metformin and my levels are actually higher. I have not been perfect with the diet but certainly much better than before. I actually had recently lost 50 lbs on a high protien diet before I had the initial tests run. My weight loss physician had told me I was losing the weight kind of fast and I needed to gradually bring back in good carbs. So I started that; maintained the weight loss for 3 years and now am told I am insulin resistant. So now I am trying to increase my exercise and back off any carbs as much as possible. I guess my questions are 1. what are the "numbers" I am looking at? My glucose was not high on the tests but she said my insulin was. She kept mentioning number sin the teens; like she said 14 was a cut off and I am at like 15; then 21; then 19... 2. what am I supposed to be eating? I am afraid to eat anything. 3. Why would the metformin not be working? Any help would be great!!,2009,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a Type II diabetic (diagnosed 10 years ago) on metformin (1;000 mg. daily) and prandin (2 mg with meals). I have been diagnosed with a heart problem and have been exercising regularly as part of cardiac rehab. I have been experiencing frequent sugar lows; resulting in blurred vision and dizzyness. Last week; I awoke in the hospital after having diabetic seizures. I remember feeling weak and taking some glucose tablets. Apparently these weren't enough to ward off the seizure. I am worried about future seizures. Specifically; I am wondering if the seizures might aggravate my heart condition. I have a fully blocked coronary artery. I am also worried about possible brain damage. Should I continue with my exercise? How can I prevent future seizures; given that blood sugar monitoring has not helped tip me off to these sudden drops in blood sugar. I have been told not to drive for six months. Are there other activities I should curtail? How common is it for these seizures to recur? I have eliminated the prandin but remain on metformin. Any info would be appreciated.,2005,2005,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Over several years my FBG numbers have been in the 100 to 116 range. Six months ago my A1c was 6.2 then it was retested in June and again it was 6.2. My doctor says this means I do not have diabetes. Since the beginning of June I have tried to lose weight and have been checking my FBG every morning. After 1 1/2 months of low carb dieting my FBG is getting worse. The last six days FBG has been between 127 and 141. Another confusion for me is that I don't have spikes in BG during the day. I have tested 1hr; 1&1/2 hrs. and 2hrs after eating and I never go above 145. However; if I eat a regular carb meal my BG will spike at 145 and then stay above 125 for 3 or 4 hrs. I have not had one BG test below 100 since I started testing in June. What should I do or What can be done about this?,2013,2014,65,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosied with Type II Diabetes 2 years ago. I am having a wide variance in the fasting blood sugar results each morning.

I haven't eaten or had anything to drink in this time period. Is there a reason for this sudden increase? Which number is my real FBS?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Mid last year when my A1C was 6.9 and I went on a very low carb diet I had taken another A1C at home 3 months later and my A1C went to 7.3 around December 2012. I kept on the very low carb diet; eating mostly proteins - fish fish and more fish I started losing weight really fast. I was originally at 112 - 115 keeping my weight at that by eating a ton on carbs. As soon as I was diagnosed I cut out carbs and now my weight is at 92 - 95 pounds. I am very small boned and when I was younger I weighed between 90 & 95 pounds until I turn 40 something. My morning blood sugar fasting when I was first diagnosed at hardly ever below 135 in the morning. Even the first 3 months with a high protein low carb diet my sugar was staying about 125 in the morning. Now it is between 105 and 119 every morning but I have to hardly eat to maintain this blood sugar fasting. I am not on any medications at this time. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can keep my weight from going down any further without my blood sugars going up? My last A1C was 6.2 - Thanks so much; Julie,2011,2013,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,[I] [B] 3years ago I had a mild stroke; and since that day; ive been having TIA type attacks near daily. WHY? I need answers and help PLEASE[/b] I am requiring any help feedback; as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms; 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others in Doncaster; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company;I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully more than 23yrs and a director of my own businesses; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old.Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago; whilst out with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. My 24year old daughter said; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; [b]‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’[/b] I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. However from the moment I had this mild stroke I have been getting recurring stroke like type symptoms; for now 3years after from 3 to 7days a week during my sleep and frequently during the day. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months;its virtually stopped. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a heavy attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; dizziness; pain in my head; pain in my left eye socket; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have a pituitary tumor; hashimotos and type 2 diabetes. My A1c is 5.5 at most recent testing and my highs up until recently have never gone above 180. However; I started having really bad lows frequently so my dr. said I could stop taking my Janumet. Recently she suggested going back to Metformin for weight loss and PCOS possibility. I have stuggled with the Metformin gas; stomach cramps and loose stools. However; I really want to make it work because lately I have been having high blood sugars. Tonight I got up to 300 for the first time ever. (when testing anyhow). I have been drinking gobs of water and retesting and it is coming back down; still at 220 right now. Any suggestions? (PS.. yes I did eat dessert tonight... and that is the cause of the high). When I was pregnant 8 years ago and had gestational diabetes; I had no problem controlling my blood sugars and always staying below 120; but I am really struggling with it now.,2008,2009,30,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hey; just wondering if i could cease taking metformin for type 2 diabetes and lisinipril and if it would be beneficial for me to replace them with a natural Taurine supplement? I've read studies that suggest Taurine helps high blood pressure and diabetes among a ton of other illnesess; the reason I ask is because lisinipril has some rather severe side effects; I don't want to be taking a lot of chemical tablets when they could be replaced with something that is natural for my body instead of something that could be detrimental to my health in the long run; doctors nowadays seem to like to give out other drugs to treat side effects which in turn causes other side effects in a vicious cycle; they are also trying to get me on statins (surprise; surprise..). Any advice would be welcome; thanks in advance :).,2014,2014,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,i was at a party and a girl who had recently became a mother; put breastmilk on her finger and put it in my mouth; I have read that enzymes and stomach acid would kill the virus; but I am on anti-depressants; tablets that reduce stomach acid and metformin for type 2 diabetes; would I still have the neccesary enzymes and stomach acid to kill the virus taking into consideration my medical conditions; I also do not know her HIV status do not know a lot about her,2014,2014,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years ago. My care is currently through my Family Doctor. My last two HA1C tests were 7.2 and 7.4; and creatinine was 1.1. I am taking Metformin XR; 1 gm twice a day; total of 2 grams (four 500 mg tablets). I take 1 gram in the morning and 1 at night. My blood sugars tend to run high in the morning and decrease during the day. I have no specific instructions whether to take at meals; with water; etc. Would it likely make any difference to take 1.5 grams at night and 0.5 in the morning; or take it with meals or with water. I asked this of my family doctor and she was uncertain if it would make a difference. I also take glimperide; enalapril for hypertension and Crestor for high cholesterol.Although I have great trust in my Family Doctor; I am making an appointment with an Endocinologist to get advice on my medications; but that is not for 5 weeks. I would like to know your opinion on how to take Metformin; although I realize ultimately I need to follow my Doctor's advise.,2006,2010,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 42 year old female; married and in a monogamous relationship. Last week; I noticed a fairly round; brown dime-sized splotch of skin in my groin in the upper; inner thigh region. It does not itch and does not appear to be scaly. I also have had intermittent diarrhea for the past few months; although my gastroenterologist attributes this to irritable bowel syndrome. I am on Metformin for being in a "pre-diabetes" state and take birth control pills for PCOS. Finally; I have lost ten pounds in the last few months; although my doctor attributes this to the Metformin. Could you please advise as to what this brown splotch could be? I am wondering if it is some type of fungal infection (or something worse?) Thank you.,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 3 months ago. He has been able to control his sugar levels very well and is currently taking 1000 mg of Metformin daily. Within the last 3 weeks he has started having joint pain and now his ankles and feet are swelling. We have been to the doctor and they have run several blood test and have found no problems but yet he continues to be in pain. He can hardly walk on his feet. They did give him something for inflammation but it is not working. Does anyone have any ideas or has anyone experienced the same symptoms? We are desperate to find out what is going on. He is not overweight and does not have high blood pressure. The pain is also in his elbows and knees.,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,A few months ago I was diagnosed with PCOS; and I'm insulin resistant. My doctor told me that I need to go on Metformin and a low-glycemic index diet to avoid getting type 2 diabetes (and other problems) in the future. So I have been on 500mg of Metformin daily; and I've followed a low-glycemic index diet. I recently went back for testing and all of my levels are back to normal. My question is; every once in a while; if I want to splurge; is it ok? For example; could I have a slice of chocolate cake and a scoop of ice cream on my birthday; as long as I restrict carbs and sugars for the rest of the day? Thanks!,2008,2008,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Due to undiagnosed hypothyroid I gained 75lbs over a few months. With this weight gain I was then diagnosed with diabetes type 2. I have since lost half of the weight and have been able to reduce my metformin. One dr tells me I will probably never be able to stop my metformin and an other states they think I could lose 10 more pounds and not take any meds for my diabetes. Really confusing. Question is: After I eat my blood sugars go into the 200s and this lasts a couple hours. I feel so confused and drunk during this time. Then my sugar goes back to a nice 80-100 bld sugar level. My A1Cs are great between a 5-6 every month. I really do not like this feeling and makes me plan my outtings so I dont get into trouble driving or being embarassed around others as my speech slurs. Is there anything I can do? I wish I knew if this was damaging me during these two hours.,2011,2014,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,No one ever answers the type 2 diabetic forum so I thought I would try here. I have been a type 2 diabetic for 8 years. For the last year I have been on metmorfin 1000 mg a day. increasing everyday I have severe painful bowel movements. So bad that I have to curl up into a fetal position to get releif. I saw my dr on apr 30th and he took me off the metmorfin and put me on Actos 30mg. Been on if for a week now. My painful bowel problem went away and I finally ventured out of the house and did a days full of activity without have to keep running to the bathroom every 5 minutes. My blood sugars during this week have shot up above 300 but below 400. So yesterday I called my dr and he told me to go back on metmorfin plus the actos. He wants to start me on an injectible med but I am going out of town next week so he won't start it; that is why he told me to go back on metmorfin. I just started to cried because I was just starting to feel better and now after being back on the metmorfin for 24 hours I have having my issues again. Not to mention I am going on a cruise next weekend and I don't want to have this problem. I don't know what to do;;; my dr. told me to just suck it up for a few more weeks and we will get off the metmorfin in June and go on the injectible berrta med. What would happen if I just waited for the actos 30mg to take effect and no take the metmorfin. I restarted it yesterday and today I feel like ****. My stomache hurts; I have been in the bathroom almost all day.,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mother (75yrs) goes in for a bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection tomorrow morning (July 17th) ; it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently. Presently her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency?,2008,2008,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Ok; I am type 2 diabetic. I am currentlyI taking Metformin 500mg (take 1 table by mouth every morning and 2 tablets with supper); Glipizide 10mg (take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day); and Pravastatin Sodium 20mg (take 1 tablet by mouth daily). Last night around 9pm I eat 2 pieces of fried chicken with red beans and white rice; season fries; coleslaw. I did not eat all day to I guess you can say I over did it. Anyway; after two hours my blood sugar was at 350 (that's the highest i've ever seen it) so I took 2 more of my metformin. In the morning I woke up with abdominal pain and diarrhea. I ate a 1/2 of a oatmeal cook and after a few seconds I had to go to the restroom. As I was using the restroom I notice 3 yellowish oval shaped stool; I went ahead a examined it. When I sliced it the middle I saw it was white inside and the texture of the yellowish oval shaped stool was almost fatty; liver like. Can anyone please let me know if this is serious? Or is it ok and most likely it well go away after a while?,2011,2011,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,About two months ago my dr told me I had type 2 diabetes. This was based on a fasting 3 hour glucose test and likely my weight. Since then I have been checking my sugars at least twice a day and making better choices when eating. Nothing too restrictive; just less stupid. She also put me on 500 mg of metformin once a day. In that two month period my blood sugar has never measured over 119. My fasting BS (in the morning) is almost always under 100 and never over 119. Two weeks ago my A1C was 5.6. Am I truly diabetic and just doing a good job at managing it or did I just need to wise up on what I ate and when? Thanks!,2014,2014,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I found out I had Diabetes type 2 in October 2007; I am still learning to find out what I can eat to control my blood glucose levels. My doctor put me straight onto Metformin. 12 years ago I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. I was diagnosed by tests that I had an underactive thyroid for which I have been treated for ever since. I have never weighed anything more than 144lbs. I am 5 ft 5 inches tall. When I was put onto the medication for Thyroid the weight dropped off and stayed off. I then weighed 135lbs and managed to maintain this weight until October last year when I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. First I didn't believe the doctor; but high glucose levels were found in my urine and blood; so I started working with him. I am not overweight problem and have no other symptoms. My doctor tells me I'm the fittest diabetic he has. But I am still confused. Did they misdiagnose my Thyroid problem? I'm still losing weight too. Will I stop losing weight that I can ill afford to lose at somepoint and how do I manage to juggle maintaining the weight that I have and my blood glucose levels. I've accepted that I have diabetes.. but still don't understand why?.. especially since it seems I am the first member of my family to get it.. I have found no links to genetics at all. And as for the tyroid.. I'm still unsure of the diagnosis as when I started on the Metformin the doctor lowered my dose of Thyroxine by 50 micrograms and this had no ill effect on. Can you help?,2008,2008,47,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,It seems this forum is becoming an alternative / supplement forum so I hope it is ok to post this. Here is an interesting article about a prescription drug; the diabetic drug Metaformin. An old drug that has been around a long time. And is very inexpensive. They are finding it has many uses including anti-cancer properties. I think it is great when an existing drug is found to work for other diseases. Especially drugs that patents have run out and are now inexpensive. Also Metaformin has shown promise against many cancers. You will hear more about off label Metaformin use in the near future. Research led by the University of Leeds has found drugs such as anti-diabetic drug Metformin and AICAR; used to combat obesity; can prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating in the body. Hepatitis C virus affects an estimated three per cent of the world's population and there are four million carriers of the virus in Europe alone. The virus affects the liver and recovery rates are low: only around 40 per cent of hepatitis C sufferers will fully recover; with others developing cirrhosis and in many cases; liver cancer. "We're very excited about these findings;" says Professor Mark Harris from the University's Faculty of Biological Sciences. "These drugs are already on the market; and whilst substantial clinical trials still need to take place before they can be used to treat hepatitis C infection; we think it could be an enormous step forward in the battle against the virus." The research was supported by the Wellcome Trust; the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Drugs such as Metformin and AICAR work by stimulating an enzyme called AMP kinase (AMPK) which regulates energy within our cells - the very enzyme that hepatitis C virus represses to enable it to replicate. AMPK's usual function is to conserve the energy balance in cells; which it does by temporarily shutting down the production of lipids (fats) and membranes when it senses an increase in energy requirements. Professor Harris and his team have now shown that the hepatitis C virus switches off AMPK so that the cell continues production of lipids and membranes; both of which are vital to its survival. "You'd expect AMPK to be activated when a cell becomes infected by a virus; because it would sense the increase in energy required to enable the virus to replicate. In such cases; AMPK would shut down certain functions of the cell temporarily until the cell's energy is rebalanced;" says Prof Harris. "We found that hepatitis C virus; because it needs lipids and membranes; causes the opposite to happen." Building on this finding; the research team were able to examine how cells would react when treated with common drugs that stimulate AMPK. They found that in infected cells; the drugs were able to halt virus replication; enabling cells to clear the infection. A patent has been filed on the discovery and the team will shortly embark on a small-scale clinical trial with The University of Nottingham. This will provide a greater evidence base upon which future clinical trials can be based. More information: This research is published in a paper entitled Enhanced hepatitis C virus genome replication and lipid accumulation mediated by inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase in the latest edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).,2006,2010,52,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 53 year old female with a family history of Type 2 diabetes. In the last two years; I have put on a significant amount of weight (probably 35-40 pounds); almost all of it in the belly. I seem to be hungry all the time and I'm fatigued a lot. I keep reading about belly fat and insulin resistance and hunger; so I got myself tested for diabetes. My numbers came back as follows: fasting glucose was 86; insulin was less than 2.0 and Hemoglobin A1c was 5.3. For good measure; I bought a glucose meter and my fasting glucose is always normal; although after eating carbohydrates; my glucose will rise to about 122 one hour after a meal and then instead of falling; at two hours; I will be at 126 or so. My doctor said these numbers are completely normal and; in fact; given the excess belly weight that I am carrying; I must have a gene that is protecting me from becoming diabetic. I have a few questions. Do you think any further diabetes testing is warranted? Could a drug like Metformin help me lose weight even if I am not diabetic? I am really at wit's end with my weight gain. I had two Cushing's workups which came back negative. I was diagnosed last year with Hashimoto's; but I am on thryoid replacement and with replacement have a TSH of 2.75. Am I just wasting my money with more diabetes' tests? I just don't know what is wrong with me.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Recently; after a very long day (about 20 hrs.); I began to notice that my vision was similar to that when I am cross-eyed. After resting sufficiently; I am still having the same problem 2 days later. The best that I can see in the mirror is that 1 eye is not always moving as quickly as the other; but a lazy eye doesn't seem to be realistically caused by fatigue. Otherwise; my eyes do not visually appear to be crossed; but my vision comes off as such. Is this something that will go away; or should I see an optometrist or physician? Is there anything I can do to improve without seeing a dr.? If it helps; I have both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and take a whole lot of insulin as well as metformin and actos (also for low HDL). I also have hasimoto's disease.,2009,2009,23,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; My mom just turned 50 this year. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes two years ago and was 168 pounds at 5"5'. Her doctor put her on Metformin; and she is supposed to be on it for life. Her doctor told her that she would lose weight on it; and the lowest she's been so far is 143 pounds when she weighed herself within the past couple of days. She was at the doctor in December because she had laryngitis and she was weighed at 150 and he was glad about the weight loss. However; I am worried because she lost 6 pounds in a month without even trying. She tells me that it's from the Metformin and because she just started working two jobs last month and she moves around a lot; rather than her staying at home all day like she used to. She has always eaten healthy so I can't say that her weight loss is from a change in eating habits. She is also on medication for overactive thyroid; asthma; and high cholesterol. I just can't help but be really worried about this. I know her doctor told her that she would lose weight on Metformin; but wouldn't she have seen the weight loss right after she started it? And not continue to lose weight 2 years later? She had a colonoscopy two years ago and her doctor said she looked great and he wants to see her in 10 years for another colonoscopy; however; she had some type of bacteria in her stomach that causes ulcers so she went on meds for a week to get rid of it. I did some research on unexplained weight loss on the web and I am really worried that it is cancer; particularly in the stomach. Please help me out! Thank you. She also has been getting hemorrhoids about once or twice a month; is that normal? or a symptom? I know I sound crazy right now but I just hate worrying.,2009,2010,19,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a type II diabetic diagnosed this year with food allergies: corn; peanuts; soybeans; eggs and lettuce and various things in those families. That puts a great many "health" and low fat foods off my list and diabetic staples like eggs are a fond memory. I can't find any information out there to help me balance these evils (diabetes and allergies) against each other. When I was eating the foods I'm allergic too I had debilitating diarhea and a continuous runny nose and chest conjestion. I'm glad to have those gone.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; Heres the background Am currently being checked for PCOS. Have had a brain MRI to r/o pit tumor and MRI and CT scan of the adrenals. All are neg. I failed the 24 hour urine for cortisol but passed the dexamethasone suppression test. On the CT scan cystic adnexa were found bilaterally on the ovaries so now the endo is looking at PCOS. I have a infertility hx; was eventually able to concieve with added progest. due to a short luteal phase. If it is found to be PCOS.....what are the chances of having insulin resistence (what is this anyway) and developing type 2 diabetes. What would the symptoms of insulin resistence be? How is it treated? can it be managed by a PCP or should an Endo oversee care? Thanks,2008,2008,,Female

My blood sugars are never over 200 and usually range from 90 to 150. Recent bloodwork has shown that I am positive for GAD antibodies. I have been told that <2 is normal and mine was +12.

It usually stays at 5.8 or 5.9. Will the Lantus stop what the antibodies have started...will my pancreas completely stop making insulin due to the antibodies? Can anything stop it?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Haven't yet been in to see an endocrinologist or a dietary person to talk blood sugar levels and diet. Am having problems dealing with my insurance company who won't even cover my stupid testing strips. They basically are $1 a strip. Expensive. I had gestational diabetes several years ago (gestational diabetes was covered 100% for supplies and visits); so I am aware of how to do all the blood testing and have been doign fine about that. I also know that gestational diabetes is more strict with blood sugar levels than regular type II diabetes. Now that I have type II; what are the ranges to aim for for blood sugar levels for fasting and then for 2 hours after a meal? Right now; I'm testing about 100 to 110 in the morning and about 110 to 130 after meals. If I forget to take my metformin at night; my fasting level is usually around 120 to 130. But; with the medicine it is 100 to 110 fasting. Is this good? Is it supposed to be under 90? Or can I not aim for that goal since I'm a diabetic and is it unrealistic? When I was gestational diabetic I had to aim for under 90 fasting and under 120 for after meals; which I ended up on insulin while pregnant to do so. My Dad says he has to aim for 90 to 110 fasting and under 140 after meals. Does gender and age matter for what you aim for as well? I'm 34 and female; so not sure what my goals shoudl be. I'm taking 1500 mg of metformin with dinner every night. No insulin; at least not yet; hopefully not for many years since I'm young; well at least younger than my dad. The doctor wasn't much help. And the book I got with my tester said to aim for under 170 two hours after a meal. That seems really high to me.,2007,2008,107,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I was just diagnoised having type 2 diabetes last Friday. My blood levels were at 345 after fasting. Doc put me on 500mg of metformin twice a day. I begin dieting Saturday. My sugar levels are dropping rapidly. Just after 3 days; about 30 minutes ago; my results were 132. This is 4 hours after eating lunch. My question is; is it normal for it to drop this quickly? Do I need to be concerned that it drops to low? Also; I was using the restroom up to 7 times a night before; and now just after 2 days on this medicine; I only went once the past 2 nights. Is this normal? Sorry with all the questions; but I am new to all of this. Thanks for any advice.,2011,2011,52,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been on 2500 mg of Metformin for 13 years now due to being insulin resistant BC of Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Have been on several other medications for insulin resistance that did not work. The Metformin doesn't really work but works better than anything else I've ever been on. My sugar still runs 200 after fasting for 12 hours. Are there any tests that can be done to tell if you really need insulin?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Well im new to the forum; this is actualy my first post. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes late summer last year; im 17 about to turn 18 soon. I started by monitering my diet and still I needed medication; so my doctor prescribed me with Glucophage XR 500mg; 2 pills a day taken at same time. They worked great; I never had a problem; then last month my glucophage was substituted with Metformin ER 500mg; same dosages; I noticed changes after about a week; my sugar was higher then it was on average with Glucophage; so I mentioned it to my mom; we kept monitering it; after about a month of being on it my blood sugar level was getting pretty high.. 2 hours after a normal sized meal(only 60-70 carbs) my bloodsugar was about 250-350; so we got the glucophage back finally; its been three days now and my blood sugar is still staying pretty high. What im wondering; is it common for this to happen? is it because of medication switching(ive heard that metformin is **** compared to glucophage)?.. Or maybe is my situation getting worse and my body isnt able to produce insulin as well as it was when I was first diagnosed? Thanks for the help; it is much appreciated; Michael,2004,2004,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My doctor put me on Metformin 500 milligrams. I have always been checking my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning and they always stayed between 100 + 108. I wanted to get my blood sugar levels below 100 but was unable to. That what is until I started using stevia in my diet. Stevia is an all natural sugar substitute which comes from a plant in South America. There are some studies out there( although the studies are limited) that shows Stevia has an effect on blood sugar in a positive way. I started using stevia for about 3 days now. For 2 days already my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning dropped to 94 and 95. Does stevia have anything to do with it? So far I think my research is inconclusive as I have not been using Stevia long enough to determine this. however I am watching this closely. Has anyone noticed a positive change in their blood sugar level using stevia?,2016,2016,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,[Im 31 and a Type 2 Diabetic (2 yrs.). I take Insulin and Metformin daily. My diabetes are uncontrollable and this year Ive had recurring yeast infections everyday. I scratch a lot & it got to the point of me shaving constantly to relieve my itch. It became a horrible habit. I never had a menstrual cycle in my entire life either if that helps. ] Last night; I had sex with my on and off boyfriend. Last time we had intercourse was a few weeks ago. Early this morning I developed a pimple on the inner left lip of my vagina. If touched; I experience a sharp pain on it. Later on today; that pimple morphed into a cluster. On camera it looks yellowish on the cluster. Its itchy and it hurts to wipe my vagina after using the bathroom. I went to the doctor immediately! However; although they stated it doesnt look like herpes; I still got tested and waiting for results. Im just afraid thats all.,2017,2017,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Thank you so much for answering my questions.I'm a 48 year old female. Along with the hypothyroid problem -I take metformin (500mg with meals)for insulin resistance. I was told it was 'borderline type II Diabetes'. So; would that be the problem then? If so how would I handle that? I've also had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia -though a lot of the symptoms have eased (if not abated yet);since starting thyroid med. The only BP that I take is HCTZ diuretic(hydrochlorothiazide) 25mgs in the morning. Would you consider that aggressive enough treatment? I was prescribed Inderal initially; along with the diuretic. But it caused a problem with worsening hypothyroid symptoms;(blocks conversion of T4-T3)- so I was put on the Ace Inhibitor Altace (with HCTZ). After 2 weeks I was tested and showed a marked problem with creatinine levels. I wonder -if I'm only able to tolerate a diuretic (as it would appear) - whether a change to a stronger one like Lasix (Furosemide) might do some good in dropping the extreme BP spikes? Its good to know hypothyroid doesn't cause the BP problem. I'm wondering if levels of thyroid MEDICATION might - even though levels are presently optimized? BP readings done on multiple days. Thanks so much little0ne,2002,2002,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 60 year old female that was diagnosed with Type 2 about 7 years ago. I was on medication to control it but had reached a point to where I should start insulin. About 9 months ago due to finacial problems and I had to drop insurance etc..........my point being I had to quit all my meds (Metformin; Victoza; Cymbalta; Vytorin; Levothyroxin and Lisinopril). I try to watch my sweets and carbs; although I'm not always successful with it; and that is all I'm doing at this point. I have recently started experiencing pains in my legs; even so bad that they hurt to the touch; burning sensations (like sunburn) from middle of body to top of my head; itching when I try to sleep and lately headaches. These symptoms occur mostly at night. I've also have loss 58 lbs without trying. Could this be caused from the diabetes; can I be starting to have a stroke? Is there any OC meds I can take?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have just had an emg/nerve conduction study and the doctor was clearly biased. There are multiple symptoms that may point to something else. Yes.. I know that diabetes contributes to this... I am tired of being misdiagnosed at every turn in my life. Perhaps someone has some idea of how i should approach this?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was wondering if anyone here has known of anyone who's secondary symptoms with diabetes have been relieved after discontinuing aspartame use? Since being diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic three years ago; I have; of course; dramatically increased my use of Aspartame; in that time I have developed depression; muscle aches; severe fatigue and gastro-intestinal problems; none of which can be diagnosed accurately. I've tried many medications and for these symptoms; in tandem and individually. I have never discontinued using aspartame; although I have considered it after reading a couple of the anti-aspartame websites that suggest some of my symptoms may be related to artificial sweeteners. I am aware that there is no official documentation of a link between aspartame/artificial sweeteners and the many maladies the anti-aspartame sites claim; but; as I said; I do wonder; and wanted to ask if anyone here had any information for me! Thank you; Gina.,2003,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Well 3 months ago my A1C was 6.5 up from 6.03 months earlier; my doctor uped my medication from 50 mg metformin 2Xday to 1 and 1/2 gram 2Xday ( 3 times my regular dose). I am now having to feed the medication to keep my levels from dropping too low ( like 32 to 40). I am gaining weight and my new A1C was 7. I think that I am taking too high a dose; what do you think? I believe in my heart that this is too high a dose!!!! I spoke to my doctor and he says it's not to high. What do you think?? please help,2009,2009,48,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Years ago the drs told me I had type II diabetes. I'm talking 20 years ago. Lost a lot of weight and never heard anymore about it. I went to a new endocrinologist and had the sugar test done. My h1c test was perfect. I had to go back and do the sugar test. When I started the test fasting my sugar was 117. After drinking the sugar drink the first 30 minute blood test my sugar went to 195; then they took it again at the next 30 minutes and again at the 2 hr mark. My sugar at this time was 75 and they had to give me a sugar tablet to get my level up before I could leave. when I went back to talk to the dr he put me on metformine. since then I have not taken the meds. When I get up in the morning my sugar is between 77 and 90. After a regular meal and even drinking sweet tea my sugar never goes over 145. I don't understand diabetes at all I guess. I can't figure out why I would be put on medicine. Can anyone help explain to me what the reasoning would be. Thanks and God bless,2012,2012,45,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism for around 15 years now; as well as Sleep Apnea (7 yrs); and now Diabetes Type II (2 years). I have been under the care of my doctor all this time and prescribed thyroid medicine; metformin; and use the sleep apnea machine when I sleep. I get 7 or more hours of sleep a night and is usually restful. For the past 5 years or so I have noticed my energy levels decreasing quite rapidly. My doctor has played with my meds to keep them within the appropriate ranges and this never seems to help. I otherwise have a healthy checkup when I go in. All other blood work is in the norm; blood pressure is in the normal range. Last year I was diagnosed as having low testosterone. Less than 200. I started injections for about 6 months and my readings only came up to 330. Still feeling lethargic and no improvement the doctor stated my testosterone levels would not increase as they should have but didn't. So i stopped taking the injections as they didn't seem to be working. I don't know what else to do. I have suggested everything to my doctor to do things different. Even going to alternative doctors and such. He said those guys are for healthy patients and nothing they can do will improve what I'm already doing. So geez i'm out of ideas and am really tired of being tired and no energy. And when I mean no energy it's the type where you come home and have to lay down because you are just wasted sort of feeling. I would love to work out and be more active but you need energy to be energetic. Even when i was working out all the time in the last year I was still no more energetic then I am now. And I have no depression issues going on. Any ideas?,2009,2012,50,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 33 yrs old and have always been classified as pre-diabetic with fast glucose between 100-110. But that was several years ago. After my husband lost his job we went several years without insurance and medical care. Now two years later I finally started randomly checking blood sugar levels ( several family members are diabetic). My fasting sugars are 115-130 on 1000mg of metformin twice daily. I am on a strict diet with no sugar; low carbs; and no fat. I also lost 20 pounds so that I would no longer be overweight. THis has not helped. When I was originally placed on Metformin for PCOS and metabolic syndrome 3 yrs ago my blood sugar level was 110 with at least half of my diet consisting of chocolate and soda. So it is very frustrating that I am working so hard on this diet and still having high sugar levels. Last week I was craving chocolate so bad....so I had a hershey bar and a REAl coke...it tasted great but 3 hours later my blood sugar was around 250. I have a dr appt next week but am curios as to what they will say. Will I still be a pre-diabetic or does the higher sugar levels on increased metformin mean I am probably type II?,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm type 2 diabetic. I have been taking Metformin 500mg 1 tablet a day for the last 3 years. My A1C is in control (6.0). It appears that I am hitting so called "dawn phenonmenon" whenever I drink alcohol (just 1 drink). Before going to bed my blood sugar is about 110 whether I drink alcohol or not. But my fasting glucose is between 140 and 150 if I drink alcohol and it is from 115 to 125 if I don't consume any alcohol the previous night. In summary the dawn phenomenon is exasperated by alcohol. But every thing I am reading is against this. I'm wondering if any one has any logical explanation for this.,2008,2008,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have hypothyroidism and I have also been diagnosed with PCOS using labs and ultrasound on ovaries. I am still experiencing horrible fatigue and occasional tingling in my hands and feet. I had thought this was thyroid-related; but now I am wondering about insulin resistance. I am concerned since I have PCOS as well as relatives with type 2 diabetes. I asked my doctor about it and he said that my fasting-glucose levels have always been normal (in June it was 81); my non-fasting serum insulin was normal (level was 8); non-fasting c-peptide was normal (level was 2.9); so it isn’t an issue. I requested the 2hr GTT w/insulin check. He felt it was a waste of my time to get this test; but gave me the order to get it done anyway. I did that yesterday. 1) What would indicate insulin resistance with this test? I am considering switching doctors because I am not sure if the doc I am seeing is right for me. 2) Would a reproductive endocrinologist treat both PCOS and hypothyroidism or do they only treat people with issues in trying to get pregnant? 3) I have heard of many people with PCOS taking Glucophage. If this is a proper treatment for IR; is the extended release version better than the regular? Thanks for your help.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a single 30 y/o female. My sister was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and I have struggled with my weight since I was younger and wanted to have both things tested. I am heavy-set with a BMI of 20% however my cholesterol levels are normal and my blood pressure is 120/70. I am extremely active (baseball/hockey/tennis/running) and exercise daily. I am most definitely not a late night or throughout the day snacker and I also am very cautious about what I eat and do not eat sugary foods (soda; candy; bakery items) and try to avoid pasta and bread (bagels; etc.) as often as possible. My only terrible habit is that most days I tend to go the entire day without eating - only eating a sensible and appropriate dinner when I get home from work. (I was always under the assumption that a person should eat only when they feel hungry) My doctor performed several blood tests and advised that the tests showed that my "fasting" blood test showed I had very high insulin levels. She has prescribed Metformin for me; however; I have been trying to find out exactly what this means to no avail. She has confirmed that I do not have diabetes but hasn't / can't give me a name for what it is I do have. I just want to know what this means as far as a diagnosis is concerned so that I can educate myself a little more and determine what lifestyle changes I have to make in order to deal with this illness. I have recently been forcing myself to eat several small sensible meals/snacks throughout the day to try and maintain a steady blood sugar level but don't even know if this is the right thing to do or not either. When I attempted to make an appointment with my current doctor to discuss this matter in more detail; she scheduled one six weeks from now so needless to say I am searching for a new doctor. I would like to be able to explain a little more about my condition to my new doctor however; which is why I would like someone's help in explaining what this condition is called and what exactly this all means.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi everyone! I'm still kind of new at this so bear with me. My name is Misty and I am 23 years old. About 4 months ago; I was diagnosed with PCOS. I was also told that I had type 2 diabetes that is uually associated with it. I am currently taking metformin for the diabetes and my doctor said in the long run it would help with fertility. I have CRAZY periods!! I'm on it now; and have been on it since May 20th. They never stop! I have to go in frequently to check my blood count to make sure I don't need blood. I have tried depot; pills; more pills; ring; and patch with no success of making my period normal. I have recently had an IUD put in because my doctor thinks that it may stop my period. Has anyone done this? And if so; did you still bleed for 2 months after having it put in? I'm still new at knowing about PCOS and to be honest it scares me a little. I have no children and would love to have some one day. Thank you so much! Misty,2011,2011,23,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dear Doctor.... My husband is Type 2 Diabetic and was diagnosed approx. 8 yrs ago. He is a 54 yr old African American male..and ever since I can remember....usually within an hour of his eating; he has loose stools. Matter of fact I don't ever recall that his stools are completely "formed" but not watery persay; either...Just LOOSE. They are never accompanied by cramps...bloating...pain...no obvious bleeding; neither bright red OR "Coffee ground". He is one of the rare diabetics who doesn't gain weight....but is very small framed; 5'6" and 140 and he has maintained that weight ever since we have been married; going on 24 yrs. My question is...what could be the causes of him never having formed stools...and I know I cannot view this as a diagnosis...but I would like ideas of what to research as to what COULD cause this. He DOES take Glucophage; Amaryl and Zocor....and I understand the meds may cause diarrhea but I believe his occurances of loose stools began long before him taking meds for Diabetes and cholestrol. He is very compliant with his meds and his 3 montly CBCs always check out in the acceptable range. Thank you.,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had to go to the ER in early May for severe abdominal pain that had me doubled over in pain on my living room floor vomiting into a towel because I could not get up and walk (much less run) to the bathroom. I have had this pain before but it had never become sooooo severe. It always started out mildly between the end of my rib cage and my belly button. It never moved to either side. the worse it became; it would slowly move down into my pelvic bones it seemed & would occasionally cause kind of a numbing feeling in my right leg or foot. SO I go to the ER & they do bloodwork; but no scans of any kind; hook me to an IV & hydrate me & give me pain meds. All they found in my blood work was that my blood sugar was "a little" elevated. They sent me home. I followed up the next day w/ my regular doc & he said the "little" elevation in my blood sugar was 220. (I had had a yearly checkup in February & my blood sugar was 96 at that time.) So he prescribes Metformin for me; gives me a diet pill ( i weighed 232); and some Nexium for the pain in my gut--he offered no diagnosis of THAT problem. He sent me for abdominal & pelvic ultrasounds--both came back normal. I've now lost 22 pounds. I've seen him a few times since (he took me off the Metformin-it was making me nauseous ALL the time & Nexium cuz it obviously wasn't helping my stomach pain) & then I had to go back in early July for that same pain again & he sent me for CT scan. I do not have those results yet; but in all of my research; I can't find any DEFINITIVE cause for the pain; but i do find A lot of things that scare me when I speculate as to what the pain COULD be. Any ideas or directions as to where I should go or what type of doc I need to see?,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Type II. After a bad experience with Avandia; I'm starting on Lantus. My doctor's procedure is to stop taking Glucovance and to just be on Lantus; nothing else such as metformin. I am to keep increasing the Lantus until my levels are in the 180s. I am at 30 units of Lantus now; but my levels are all over the board depending on when I test. My doctor didn't say when to test and I think that would make a lot of difference. So; I am doing a fasting test in the morning and then test a few more times thru the day. Fasting levels are around 120 to 150. Other levels have been mostly in the 200s. I just wonder if it's standard to start on Lantus this way. It seems odd not to add in metformin or another oral med and then start adjustment depending on levels. I guess I am concerned about insulin resistance and the part that plays. If there is no metformin to allow the cells to be more permeable; then what is the good of just being on insulin? I guess I just don't see the logic of starting this way and am wondering if it's standard. My doctor says that Lantus dosage can get up to 60 or 70; but I've never heard of it that high. My family is rampant with diabetes and even 30 seems high. I'd appreciate some feedback.,2010,2010,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I recently went through some lab work to find out why my menstrual cycle was messed up and it was discovered that I was "insulin resistant". Now my doctor did not give me much information but placed me on metformin 500mg twice a day. (Nasty side effects) I have a huge family history of type 2 diabetes and do not want to progress to having it myself. My question is prediabetes and insulin resistant the same thing? I was told I needed to lose weight..which I have been trying to do. I also started following the same kind of diet my diabetic grandfather follow which includes not consuming more than 45g of carbs per meal. (This is under his doctor's advice). I have no idea if this is a good diet or not...but have found how hard it can be to stay under that 45 gram limit at mealtime.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I found out I had prediabetes about 2 months ago. I was overweight and fairly sedentary. I have lost 8% of my body weight; I exercise without fail every day (bike riding or brisk walking usually). I count my carbs and rarely go over 30 a meal; eat "right"--lots of veggies; whole grains when I use grains; always under my calorie goal.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Good afternoon. I have been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes for about 5 years now...I think I had the problem well before that but I had a doctor who would never run the test (just lose some weight; etc). I'm not very good about keeping my levels under control because I get so discouraged that I just give up from time to time. For example; 3 1/2 weeks ago now I was feeling very disoriented so I checked my sugar (please note that I had not been eating correctly or exercising but I was taking most of my medicine) and it was 458. Needless to say; this scared me straight. For the last 3 1/2 weeks; I haven't missed any of my medicine (Byetta 10(2 X per day); Metformin 500(1 X per day); Amaryl 4 mg (2 pills; 1 X per day)); I have exercised (real exercise; sweat and everything) for a minimum of 30 minutes every single day; I haven't eaten any sweets and have kept my carbs very low (lots of fish; egg whites; and cucumbers). I'm monitoring my sugar 4 times a day right now. My lowest reading was last week and it was 197; my 7 day average is 268; right now (just checked it) it is 325. I am currently without medical insurance and can't afford to go have a million tests run right now. I've called my doctor's office and asked about Novalog Mix 70/30; I was put on it after a brief hospital stay about 1 year ago and it's the only thing that has ever really dropped my blood sugar. I'm waiting to hear back from the doctor now. Another interesting thing is my blood sugar is always it's highest when I first wake up in the morning (well over 300 in the am). I've tried checking it in the middle of the night to make sure that it isn't dropping to low at night (I eat supper around 5:30 and don't eat again till breakfast) and it's usually just in the low 200's. I just wondered if you had any suggestions or ideas as to what my problem could be and what I could do to help bring this under control.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm wondering if thyroid issues could be causing me to "appear" to be on the cusp of diabetes. I was having bouts of hypoglycemia that was extremely obvious; but until I had a glucose tollerance test was completely unaware that I was also having hyperglycemic episodes as well. I was diagnosed as "prediabetic" in October. My A1C was a consistent 5.9 until last week when it was 6.3. I have worked very hard at monitoring what I eat and the quantities that I eat. I've totally changed my choices in high calorie foods; opting for low fat; low sugar substitutes. I've given up a lot of foods that I really like for fear that there would just be no middle of the road with them for me. So you can imagine my surprise at the spike in my A1C. Even more scarey though is the way my TSH level has been fluctuating for more than a year and a half now. In January; it was 3.65. Last week it was 32.65. My current does of medication for my thyroid is .125 mcg which I am now taking 2 of every other day and 1 on days in between. Coincidentally enough; my blood sugar readings the past couple of days have been fantastic. Mostly 70's; 80's and 90's. Nothing that would support an A1C level of 6.3. My question.....Could something going on with my thyroid cause me to "appear" to be diabetic? For background history; both my parents were adult onset diabetics; my mother brittle. My mother also had a portion of her thyroid removed because of a diagnosis of Graves Disease. I myself have been on thyroid replacement therapy for more than 20 years. My sister (1 year older than I) has been on the same dose of thyroid .025 mcg since she began taking it. I began with .025 and have had increases and decreases in mcg's through out my history with this medication. Any help with this would be extremely appreciated. Thank you.,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 40 yr old female with a growing medical history. I feel like my body is falling apart and although under the care of SEVERAL physicians; I am feeling helpless. I am about 90 lbs overweight and have struggled loosing weight for years. Nothing I do works and each time I have gone to the doctor in the past their answer has been "loose weight". After years of stomach issues; I had my gallbladder removed in 2001 (HIDA scan showed it wasn't working). I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2003 (due to clotted periods and extreme hair growth on my face; neck and arms). I have been told I have IBS (but I feel that is a cop out for them not wanting to find the answers to my stomach issues). I had to have an epigastric hernia repair with mesh in 2007 due to 4 tears in my abdomen wall. I was told last summer (after years of bladder/kidney infections) that I have Stage 3 bladder prolapse and that it has also made my uterus fall (Stage 2) in which I still need to schedule surgery. Now recently (2 yrs ago) I have been diagnosed as hypothyroid and have increased my Synthroid does from 88mcg to 125mcg over that time. I was diagnosed at Type 2 diabetes (A1C at 7) about 6 weeks ago. Have issues with high cholesterol and elevated liver enzymes. I was referred to a new Gastroenterologist about a month ago; which ended up with more bloodwork; an abdominal ultrasound and an EGD/Colonoscopy. Results - BLOOD WORK - Inherited liver disease - NEGATIVE Ferritin - HIGH @ 272 ANA Direct - POSITIVE ABNORMAL @ <1 AST - HIGH @ 126 (was 100 the month before) ALT - HIGH @ 101 (was 87 the month before) ULTRASOUND - Liver - Diffuse increase echotexture. Enlarged. Right hepatic lobe sagittal measures 23 cm. No liver nodules or masses. Spleen - Homogeneous echotexture. Enlarged measuring 13.7 cm. Otherwise results were "normal" that I can tell. *Being referred to liver specialist and appt is Aug 23rd. EGD - Excess bile in stomach. Erythema; congestion and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible w/ gastritis (biospy). COLONOSCOPY - 1 polyp in ascending colon (biopsy). ** Had several polyps in same test 2 years before; benign. Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids. Random biopsies done due to chronic diarrhea including microscopic colitis (biopsy). My health issues keep growing and I keep feeling sicker and sicker. I have no appetite and am having to force myself to eat (barely getting 700-1000 calories if that a day) and still not hungry. Extreme fatigue to the point that I can barely get out of bed in the morning. All of this is making me extremely anxious and obsessing about what is going on. Need help and support on how to view all of this information.,2010,2010,39,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a type 2 diabetic; but am not; and never have been; overweight. It runs in my family; on both sides. My last A1C was 11. I take Invokana and Januvia. Since last month; I've changed my diet the best way I know how. I only have 1 starch a day; and that's a whole wheat starch; 1 serving of fruit; and the rest is veggies; nuts; and seeds. BUT; my readings are still high at times. What else can I do? I go back in another week for another A1C and I really want it to be better.,2016,2016,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hey ladies! I just found out today that I have PCOS! So; losing weight is going to be harder for me than I had hoped. It has always been hard for me to lose weight (now I know why) but I am considering the South Beach Diet. Anyone have good luck with that diet? I already work out; so now I just need to make sure my diet is in check. I have been counting calories and staying under 1300 but I don't think that is going to be most effective for me now that I know that i have severe PCOS. Doc told me that my testosterone level was high; even for a man!! So; as a woman; that didn't make me feel too great lol Anyways; just wanted to post and say UGH!!!!,2007,2008,21,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am a 40 year old male and have had problems for the last 3 years. It started with pains in my stomach and back (right side); no pressure when urinating; and feeling dreadful (sick; dizzy). I was diagnosed last year with type 2 diabetes and have been on metformin for about a year. I still have the pains in my stomach (right side and sometimes down the front of my right leg) and no pressure when urinating; and I always have a rash on the glands of my penis. I also still feel unwell. I have had blood tests which only show a slightly high blood sugar; and any urine tests are clear. My doctor is no help and I have been to a urologist who says my bladder and prostate are OK and cannot give me any answers. I am beginning to feel that my life is over and will have these pains for the rest of my life. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.,2011,2011,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,So i'm suffering from Headaches that won't go away by pain relivers like Paracetamol ; Dizziness and black out's when standing up ; Eyes pain and sensitivity to light ; Short term memory loss ; difficulties in talking ; Loss of concentration ; Hearing problems and Tinnitus ; Balancing problems; and changes in my mood and personality like GAD ; MDD {Was talking Zoloft and Lexapro} ....... 5 months ago i went to neurotologist and he ordered a CT Scan ; Came out clear and said that everything is ok ..... My question is ; Could a CT Scan detect small tumors ? Like MRI ? What should i do now ? Ps: I'm type 1 diabetic ; Taking insulin and Metformin and my last A1c is 6.3 which is great ; I'm diabetic since march this year... And most of the symptoms i mentioned above are 1.5 years old,2010,2011,22,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. I am a 40 year old male; 190 lbs; active and on low carb diet; who has been on insulin NPH BID 25 units for the past 2 years. Prior to that I took oral medications only(all sorts; metformin; avandia; etc..) In October of last year my A1C was at 6.3. Adjusting my insulin levels seemed to have no effect on my fasting blood gloucose level (typically in 130 range). August of last year I was put on Tricor and added Diovan 160 in Novemeber; and have always been taking 1000mg of metformin twice a day. Since November my blood sugar has become unmanagable (fasting in 150+ range). Recently I stopped taking Diovan; because I noticed that it appeared that this whole thing started after i took Diovan. I tested my blood sugar and my mornings results for two days were in the 130s and went up to 150 again; so I went back on Diovan per my doctor's insistence. Then my doctor suggested about two weeks ago that I switch to Lantus (My A1c is at 7.2 now). I did that and no change. I tried adjusting the amount; almost up to 50 a day; no change. Yesterday he suggested that I inject Lantus U-100 twice a day. I am getting super frustrated with this whole deal. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.,2004,2004,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My RE has been running tests to rule out why I'm having m/c's. Well the Nurse called back yesterday and said HCG is now "-" and that they got the results from my fasting blood work. Shows that my glucose is normal; but my insulin is high. I've never had issues with this and the nurse told me "there's a first time for everything"...which didn't sit well with me; but that's beside the point. They told me I have to exercise more; eat healthier (which isn't a problem; because my husband is a Type I diabetic; so we eat healthy); and start taking Glucophage (Generic Name: Metformin). I asked how long and she told me I'd be on it while I'm a patient with them and maybe after that. How can you have normal glucose and high insulin? Do they not work together? I'm just shocked because I've never been boarderline or anything until now. I thought maybe I had "gestational diabetes" and that's why it was high; but with my HCG being normal; that wouldn't be from that...would it? They wouldn't even let me exercise and wait on the medication. I'm not one that likes to use medication when I don't necessarily need to. I'm just confused and wondered it anyone had any insight they could share.,2006,2008,27,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Not so much a question as general venting and any imput is welcome! I'm 26 and found out that I had PCOS at 19 after losing 100 pounds to join the Army (which was done all the wrong ways). Once I got in the Army I couldn't maintain my weight. Had doctor appointment after doctor appointment. I knew that I starved myself to get in; but couldnt understand why I coudnt keep it off. After 1 year and facing being kicked out of the Army; I finally made them send me off post to an endocronologist where they discovered I had PCOS. I'm still in the Army; still overweight; and still dealing w/ the Army not happy with my fatness. I've been on metformin on and off since being diagnosed. I HATE taking it b/c it makes me sick. My body never got use to it. Lowering the dosage does help; but still vomit and/or have diahrrea if my diet isn't 100%. I basically do not take it anymore. I'm also on birth control to help w/ having a period. Which it had always kept me regular; but the past 6 months; that has all changed. At first they were just starting early.. then late.. and now; it's been 3 months; and I know I'm not pregnant b/c I'm not sexually active. I have doctor appoints lined but; but not for another month. I finally got to my largest ever at 310 in January. that was an eye opener. I got a personal trainer and started weight watchers. But; weight watchers actually put weight on me b/c that was WAY more food than I ate before. So; I quit that and start just my own calorie limitations. So; I have lost some weight; but it has taken me 8 months to lose 40 pounds!!! Sure; 5 pounds a month doesn't sound too bad I guess. but; I workout twice a day (all cardio; even the weight training) and eat 1000-1200 calories a day!!! I know; that isn't "enough" but if I eat more than 1200 calories; I start to gain weight. yes; my body hates me! I would love to get under 200 since I'm deploying overseas next year and I really don't want to be fat in the desert for my safety and everyone elses! The past 2 monrhs; my weight has platued eventhough I'm still doing the same things if not more. So.... FRUSTERATED!! I though w/ weight loss PCOS should get better! Mine just seems to be getting worse... :( Thanks for listening!,2009,2009,25,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I arrived at the ER with a blood sugar of 558 mg/dl. I was given 10 units of insulin via IV and was sent home two hours later with a BS of 228 mg/dl. I'm taking 1000 mg of Metformin every twelve hours but I can't get my sugar below 250 mg/dl. I've been eating two boil eggs and one slice of wheat bread with butter for breakfast and chicken salads with no dressing for lunch and dinner yet I can't get my bs below 250 mg/dl. Am I doing something wrong? why can't I get my bs in the 100's?,2014,2016,32,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Is there any correlation between elevated Alt and insulin resistance??? I found out in January of 2013 (almost 1 year ago); that I am insulin resistant. I received my blood tests results; and I am worried. My ALT is elevated. Prior to this it has always been in the normal range...I have recent blood work results from August; May; and January of 2013 to compare it to. What could this mean? It was my Endocrinologist who ran the blood work. I see him every 3 months because I am insulin resistant (not diabetic). He didn't even mention the elevated ALT...but I saw it once I received the faxed results. I also noticed that although my AST and ALK Phosphate are within the normal range; they are definitely a bit higher now than in August & January. Could this mean something? I do have my blood tests for the last few years all the way back to 2007 and my ALT has always been in the range of 12-20 and my AST in the range of 13-15 and my ALK Phosphate in the range of 52-68. Here are the most recent results... November 2013 ALT 47 "high" (normal range 6-40) AST 24 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 86 (normal range 33-115) August 2013 ALT 19 (normal range 6-40) AST 13 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 66 (normal range 33-115) January 2013 ALT 17 (normal range 6-40) AST 14 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 63 (normal range 33-115) I do not drink; I do not smoke; I only take Tylenol or Advil if I have a bad headache. Please let me know what you think? Should I be concerned? Thank you,2010,2013,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi - after trying various treatments to shake a four month cough (and about a month of shortness of breath now); my primary doctor thinks it might be related to excess fluids and a potential heart condition. I had an echo; which showed that my heart is enlarged and my ef is only around 15%. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 6 weeks ago (my ac1 was 13+) and I'm obese. However; my bp is normally around 118/80 and I just got my lipid panel back: 102 total cholestrol; 89 triglycerides. My good cholestrol is a little low; but not so much as to be a worry. I'm also very low on vitamin D. My glucose this morning was 160 and so while I'm not in range just yet; it's been steadily dropping with metformin and junuvia. I'm being scheduled for a stress test to see what else might be going on with my heart. My question is with good diabetic control and weight loss can an enlarged heart and dismal ef be reversed to the point of not needing medicine but monitoring instead? I'm a 45 year old female. Thank you for any advice!,2012,2012,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Off-topic perhaps; then again it is a risk sx of tx and rescue meds so perhaps not; it just seems to get better and better. Fasting blood lab today shows Glucose and Lipid panel showing numbers in the diabetic range! Not only does tx sometimes fail; but it seems to also make a bad situation worse. Just thought I'd share another page from my anecdotal life with HCV and it's chemotherapy as something for folks to consider when looking at whether to treat or not.\ I do have a predisposition from family on fathers side and tried to watch closely while on tx; but the few times I could convince; or remember in the brain fog; to have tests run; all seemed copacetic. But being a nonresponder; seems response is go away and come back in 6 months. Until the re-check; your on your own pal!,2006,2007,48,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband has been diabetic for 6 years. His tratment has been metformin 850g tablets. He also has high blood pressure; and takes coversyl 4mg. For the past coulpe of months he has not been feeling himself. He had some blood results which confirmed his medication was no longer controllong his condition. Also his LFT result was 307!! He has now been told he has to stop all his medication - until he has an urgent ultrasound - and we are waiting to get an emerency appointment with his diabetic specialist. I am concerned that he is on no medication at all. But ultimatelly our concerns are with the liver results. What could have caused this?? And can the damage be treated?? Is it likely that he will be put on insulin now??,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,A month and half ago i began experiencing strange movement in my entire abdomen; i ve been pregnant before and it reminds me of a full term baby rolling around in there. I recognized that these are not my normal gas cramps or bloating. I have felt very bloated; lots of belching as soon as i eat; but can be belchy any time. Doc said cramps and bloating could be from diverticulitis and treated me with cipro and flagyl; when no change i went to er. They did ct without contrast and bloodwork and said i had mild diverticulosis and to finish antbiotics. Went back again when cramps; bloating didnt go away; this time they did a pelvic ultrasound and upper right quadrant ultrasound to check lixvliver; pancreas and gallbladder. Only found sludge in gallbladder. Sent me home with more pain meds. I wejt back again when i started to feel the cramping in my stomache and esophagus. They did chest xray; which was normal; ekg normal; and then admitted me for a colonoscopy and egd; both normal with only mild reddening of stomache so then sent home witha gastritis diagnosis. They put me on bentyl; fibercon caps. I ve been having some pain when swallowing food; and cramping of tummy shortly after eating; but egd was normal and so was colonoscopy; wondering why i still have these rolling cramps and bloating and what could this all be? Im on gerd meds protonix and carafate; but havent always been faithful to take them daily. Im diabetic type 2; on metformin 1500 a day and levoxyl due to thyroidectomy 10 yrs ago. All bloodwork and tests have been normal including two cardiolite heart tests.,2013,2013,39,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I went to doctor to be referred to a specialist to find out why my legs go numb and why my back hurts all the time. Have had many many tests in the last 6-8 months and they have found a bulging disc and degenerative disc disease; and spinal stenosis. Anyhow the NP decided to do a complete blood workup. It came back and my A1C was 6... a year ago it was 5.5. She wants to put me on metformin right away and i refuse. I have done finger sticks almost daily for the last couple of weeks and my morning sugar (usually after coffee w/creamer) is between 86-98. I just do not see how after ONE report coming back high they would want to stuff me full of medication. I would say monitor sugar; and retest. Is this the right thing or should i start putting prescription meds into my body that i may not need. Also my triglycerides were a little high; LDC was a little low. And Vitamin D was low. I am overweight; and have been trying to get a referral for weight loss surgery. This NP said that if i don't take the medication then she will make sure that i do not get approved for the surgery.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi Doc; you are a great help to many. Thanks for your support. For about 8 weeks I have been experiencing a sensation on my arms (mainly left elbow area); shoulders; and occassionally my right arm. It feels like mild sunburn. There is no rash or discoloration. Occassionally; it itches; but not acutely. I have been treated for anxiety with lexapro and lorazepam for this period; and am taking meds for diabetes type 2 (metformin; lisinopril; tricor). I had a possible HIV exposure about one year ago; tested negative in May (well outside of window period)...so I don't think that is an issue. But; I am concerned; because I have never experienced this before. In addition; yesterday I discovered a small circular purplish spot (about .10 of an inch) on my penis shaft; topside; near the base. It is flat; not painful (unless I rub it hard; and then it is like raw skin); and a surprise. My doctor has no clue. He feels sure it is not a lesion that is due to STD; but cannot say what it is. I have an appointment with a dermatologist; but it is a few weeks away; so I needed some insight now. Thanks for any help you can give. Any ideas about my skin and that spot.,2006,2006,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm not sure if this concerns with diabetes; but it's somewhere to start because I have no idea what is wrong with me. I am unable to see a doctor until next week and I'd like opinions on what might be the problem. Anything I eat; I mean anything (fruits; rice; bread; candy; nuts; anything) it causes me to do into a slightly air-headed dizzy state. Sorta like when you're slightly drunk. I can still concentrate but not as well as I should. Now this happens seconds after I eat anything; and no matter how small I eat. For example the other day I ate about 4 nuts and instantly got this dizzy sensation. It's been going on for about a week now and I'm really worried about this. I am a 20 year old male; who is active in sport; eat normally and is in the right weight.,2011,2011,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed June 2007 with Hypothyroidism. Just recently im getting the symptoms all over again.. cant get enough energy to workout; sleepy all the time; gaining weight. I was able to get down to 173 then now im way back up to 182-183 and i even got down to 179 by working out a couple of times and then next time i wanted to work out my body just isnt letting me and even tho i did the treadmill on sunday and i weight 179.4.. and on Tuesday when i was gonna workout again; i weighed 181.6 and this morning 182.8. Could it be that my medicine has stopped working? Do i gotta push myself even harder with the work outs. I recently lost 50lbs; was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes the same day as hypothyroidism and was told my cholesterol was slightly raised; and im only 21. Funny when i weighed 230lbs; i was healthy felt fine; lost the weight; and now i got all these problems. But now i gotta lose so that i can get healthier like when i was fat. jk.. i know being obese made me get these problems. So anyways.. Thyroid medicine.. how long does it take for your body to need the medicine adjusted again???,2008,2008,21,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dear Doctor; I am a 37 year old woman; 5'0 115 lbs. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ( I know physically I do not fit the mold; bad genetics) after several years of dodging it. I have three children and with all three pregnancies I had gestational diabetes and was on insulin all three times from the beginning of my pregnancies. I have tried Metformin 1000 mg a day it makes me extremely ill. Switched to Actos; felt great; then started having chest pain and twitching feeling in heart; switched to glipizide 5mg kept having severe drops in blood sugar dropping to 50 at one point; i am not a big eater prefer small meals throughout the day and i have a good diet; switched back to and currently taking metformin trying half pills throughout the day still same issue feel like i have the stomach flu everyday; my numbers are sort of all over the place; with my fastings are the most troublesome always on the high side 130-195. I am very sensitive to almost all meds and tend to just suffer with pain etc.; instead of taking medsm however; i realize i do need diabetes med. can't go untreated. (Big Picture) I have suffered from anxiety and migraines most of my adult life. In recent years (past 5) I have been suffering from widespread muscular pain (myofacial pain syndrome) according to rheumatologist; cannot sit or stand for very long without pain in neck and back; have difficulty holding a pen or typing due to pain in hands and wrists; ankles and tops of feet hurt; wake up with pain all over; chronic fatigue; shortness of breath; dizzines; ringing in my ears; eye pain; occasional numbness and tingling in my hands and feet; hot flashes; memory loss; difficulty with attention span and word recall difficulty. Not sure how this relates but; I had my tsh checked several months and had a low tsh with normal t3 and t4. It was re-checked and they were all normal. I insisted on having it checked again due to recent extreme fatigue;so tired it hurts...and new levels are as follows: last cholesteral 196 last a1c 5.8 iron slightly low tsh .25 t3 2.96 t4 1.01 ultrasound results: mildly heterogenous in echotexture without sonographically detectable focal lesions. right lobe 4.5x1.9x1.7cm; left lobe 3.4x1.4x1.5c.;isthmus is normal in calibur 3mm; no evidence of adenopathy; no extrathyroidal mass identified. Do you have any explanation? Waiting to have first appt. with an Endo.; but a month away. Thank you in advance for your time. ",2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in March of this year. My A1C was 7.8. I was given Metformin to take 2x Daily. They told me they wanted my fasting blood sugar to be 70 - 110; but I can't remember what they told me the range should be 2 hours after eating. I am only suppose to check my blood sugars once a day so I try to do it at a different time every day and I just can't remember what they told me what they should be after eating. Oh; and my A1C was down to 6.3 when they retested it in June. Thank You,2012,2012,56,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I hope someone can help me. For 10 days now I've been experiencing coldness which started from my feet-ankles-legs- thighs; then traveled to buttocks arms --face--head --mouth-ears and nose. I have been having sharp; burning pain in feet. (Thats where the pain started) I only have pain in feet. I went to see my doctor: she gave me blood tests--A1C 6.8; THyroid normal; and Toxoplasmosis test did come in yet. I have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. My cat has Toxoplasmosis and is being treated for it. Do you think I have Diabetes Neuropathy? Doctor isn't sure yet. I at times breakout in sweats ( sugar is at good Range). My body Temp was 96.4 for a little while; then went up to 97.7; it does go up to 98.6. Even my tongue gets cold. The coldness is causing me to sneeze alot and loose sleep. I am scared. If my body is cold; does it mean that it's loosing oxygen? Circulation? I have had nerve damage before from surgery in both feet. And I have 2 herniated disk and a cervical buldging disk. ( Due to a fall.). I can feel my feet; no numbness now. Prior to them becoming cold they did at times feel numb in certain spots. i have to sleep sitting up or I will get colder. My doctor doesn't think that I should go to the ER. Thank you,2008,2008,43,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 41 year old female. I am 5'2" and weigh approximately 196 pounds. (I realize I am overweight; however; I have been unable to lose weight for some reason). About three and half months ago; I was hospitalized due to chest pain and difficulty breathing. I have been diagnosed with type II diabetes for 6 years now. I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and high tryglicerides at the same time. I was diagnosed with hypertension; depression and anxiety about 2 years ago. I have been on multiple medications for diabetes from oral to insulin (for a short period of time i.e.; 1 year); as well; I have been on multiple medications to treat the high cholesterol; high tryglicerides hypertension and depression. Due these complications; I had to leave my job. My current medical regime is Actos; Metformin; Avalide; Lipitor; Lexapro and Lorazepam (prn). At the time I was hospitalized; I was diagnosed with low potassium levels. I had a stress test completed as well as some sort of nuclear medicine test to examine my heart (sorry; I don't know the type of test; I just know it had something to do with radioactive dye). These tests were all normal. Since this time; I have been sick off and on. It is beginning to cause serious problems in my life to where I am not finding answers to the causes of the symptoms I am having. Recently; I was extremely ill and am currently not feeling much better. I have had a poor appetite; nausea; some diarrhea; extreme fatigue; hot and cold sweats; blurry vision; dizziness; deleria; anxiety; poor response to stress levels; lethargy; extreme pain in my legs and feet; numbness and tingling in my arms and hands I went to my physician and he had know explanation for why my blood sugar levels were high; my blood pressure was elevated despite taking medications. He sent me to the emergency room for iv fluids. Prior to becoming ill most recently; I was retaining water badly. I assumed this was bloating from my pending menstrual cycle. When I went to the emergency room; I was given iv fluids and potassium again. My blood sugar levels have been over 200 and at times beyond 275; despite my poor appetite and at times inability to eat due to nausea. My blood pressure has been elevated despite the use of medications to treat the conditions. I was referred to see an endocrinologist and at this time; paperwork for my referral has to be reviewed to determine if I can be seen by the endocrinologist (as I only have a low income type medical insurance for use at the local university/community hospital). My question is; what would cause the above symptoms to include the low potassium levels; higher blodd pressure and high blood sugar levels? Please help someone; I am so frustrated and exhausted with the lack of answers. Anyone that can help or give me some answers would be greatly appreciated. Prissy825,2008,2008,41,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I became infected with hepatitus c back in 1995. I did have a liver biopsy in 98. Now about 2 months ago I was taken to hospital because of diabetes and they found out I had a fatty liver and they claimed they tested my blood NO HEP C found. I was told I had NASH which is NON alcoholic liver disease. I had a biopsy done these are the results. Could HEP C have done this even though it cleared itself? I was told in 98 after a biopsy that I had mild to moderate inflammation in my liver. Biopsy is somewhat fragmented; but it appears to have at least some fibrous expansion of portal tracts; possibly with fibrous bridging. Definitive changes of cirrhosis are NOT evident; however; there is marked macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis involving 70-80 % of the liver parenchyma; without a specific distrubution. Neutrophils are few; but lymphoctes are noted and hepatocyte ballooning is evident. Hemosiderosis is absent as demonstrated by an iron stain and eosinophilic globules typical of alpha -1-antitrysin deficiency are not observed on PASD staining.,2010,2010,46,Female

NO i havent she thougth thats what i may have ran alot of test and nothing really abnormal (cant really remember its been awhile)and referred me to an ob/gyn. she just did a regular check and pap (neg results never heard anything back) no ultra or vaginal sound to be sure. put on metformin and yaz BC took for about 5/6 months and stopped the metformin made me sick and quit taking the yaz altogether no sexual drive at all (whole other issue ) and well since i quit taking them about 7/8 months now and still no period. i do feel lots of pressure on the right and left sides of my pelvic area annoying pains and pressures nothing where i have to go into fetal position for just pressures ( pretty much constant) and lower back pain every know and then. something too a noticed is my bowl movements they jump from normal to soft to where i need to go but cant? diabetes runs in my family really bad; my mother and sister cervical cancer . could there be something else wrong with me or is it the "unsure do i really have PCOS" ?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 52 year old white male; genotype 2. I have completed 19 of 24 week pegasysus+ribasphere 1200 milligrams/day treatment. I have experienced hypothyroidism; and I started taking Levothyroxine 0.05mg/one a day on Jan.24. I sprained my hand and the doctor gave me Naproxen 500mg/one twice a day; and I took this med Feb. 2 and 3. On Feb. 4; I felt stomach pain and nausea all day at work; and had diarrhea beginning Feb. 4 at night; and have had this plus terrible stomach pain and gurgling ever since. Doc had me start on Prilosec OTC for 6 weeks; and discontinue the Naproxen on Feb.5 as well as Immodium but have had no relief from diarrhea or stomach pain yet. I was unable to take either ribasphere or Levothyroxine on Feb. 5. Doctor insinuated that the 2 days of Naproxen could be source of my stomach problems; and could have caused an ulcer; which Prilosec is to treat. I was undetectable at week 12; and my Jan.27 labwork indicated the following exceptions: WBC 2.6 Normal 4.0-10.5 RDW 15.3 Normal 11.7-15 Mono 14.0 Normal 4-13 Neutrophils(ABS) 1.4 Normal 1.8-7.8 Glucose 103 Normal 65-99 ALT 59 Normal 0-55 I should say that I work in a hospital; and know that I could have picked up a virus; but did not have any fever. Due to this diarrhea and painful stomach; I am thinking I cannot make myself take the ribasphere for the remainder weeks. Has anyone else had this stomach pain and what remedies did you have?,2008,2009,53,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am new here. I have been anxiety ridden for 2 years after my first episode of severe tacchycardia . After my stress/echo which caught my heart rate at well over 200bpm and seeing 2 EP doctor's they were not too concerned and said it was not the dangerous type.."atrial tacchycardia". They said I could just live with it "it would not kill me"; or they would do an ablation if I got tired of it because it will not go away. I am afraid to live since I never know when the bull will want out of my chest. Has anyone chosen to live with this or is an abation the only solution...scary! I read where nutritonal defenciencies and/or a hernia can be the cause. Help! Thanks; ajc,2008,2008,50,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed 6 months ago and at that time my A1C was 7.7 and at this months follow up it was up to 9.9 so I'm just wondering what to think about all this and what I need to do. I'm 59 years old; about 50 pounds over weight; down about 21 lbs this year. I exercise daily and will need to work more on my diet. Just increased to 1;000 mg metformin in yesterday's appointment. I'm interested in what your thoughts are on the best way to get the numbers down. Thanks!,2006,2017,58,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I started taking 500mg metforming twice a day this past Wednesday. I'm wondering how long before I start seeing lower glucose levels. My average so far is 322; highest 375 and lowest 330. I might add that I am also taking Sutant for renal cell carcinoma; Hyzar and norvesc for high blood pressure. A side effect of Sutant is a shut down of my thyroid consequently I am also taking synthroid.,2009,2009,63,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am having a hard time finding stuff on the Internet so I thought I'd just ask about peoples' experiences. If you have PCOS and take Metformin; do you have side effects? Does it help you lose weight? The reason I ask is because apparently PCOS can affect your ability to lose weight which is something I've been struggling with. I was 135 lbs pre-babies and I have FIFTY lbs to lose to get back to that weight. I'm 5'3" so it is VERY important I get down to that weight for my health because 135 lbs is the higher end of how much weight someone of that height should be. I'm just hoping that if I have to take this that it'll be beneficial on that end as well. AND... is there anyone else out there who just has high testosterone and want to chat with me?,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed June 5; 2007. My eyes were always very good until 2003 i started needing glasses and forever they pretty much stayed as bad as they have been til i was diagnosed. My doc sent me to get my eyes checked when i was diagnosed; doc told me no blood vessels popped but needed major correction. I never got glasses so now more then a year later my eyes are really bad; seems every month for sure they are getting worse. I use to have trouble reading far; like a billboard with small letters. But now even seeing 3 feet in front of me looking at the calendar across my desk is where squinting wont even let me read it. My sugar has been out of control for past 2-3 months because i just havent had a chance to get to the doc.. last time i went my A1c was 7.5 from 8.1 so it went down but i know its gone back up because during the last month i've gotten 300-400's and thats with taking 1000mg of metformin twice daily; 45mg actos once daily and taking 12units of Lantus in the Morning and 8 at night. My doctor gave me humalog for fast acting but its not in the pen form like Lantus; and i dont have access to a fridge everytime im gonna eat. so i never do it. I wanna ask him for the Humalog pen i've even printed out a free trial coupon to go with the prescription. But im scared to go because i know he'll be upset i didnt go sooner. SO i got 2 questions. #1: Do you think i could have Type 1 instead of Type 2 cause how could i progress so fast in not even 2 years yet; going from great control with just the metformin to poor control with so much; i've heard type 2s go to insulin but over 20 years not 2. And im only 22 and weigh 176; i've lost 20 pounds since diagnosed. So shouldnt i be needing less insulin not more if im a true type 2? #2: Could my eyes go this bad this fast from my sugar; am i looking at blindness at a young age? Sorry for rambling..,2008,2009,22,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I'm a 33 year old who until 2 weeks ago didn't know he was apparently quite severely type 2 diabetic. My A1C was 10.1%; and my fasting (20 hours) blood glucose was 12.6 (227 for my US friends). Long story short; my Dr told me I was pretty screwed; and started me on 2000mg of metformin (to ramp up to over 20 days); and said if there isn't major improvement in a month I go on insulin; and then sent me on my way. It seemed like a good idea for me to monitor my blood glucose; so I went and bought a meter; and started testing at least 4 times a day (wake; before dinner; after dinner; and before sleep) just to try to learn how my body reacts to everything. But that's where things start to get weird; because what I'm seeing doesn't seem to match anything that others have said to expect. Here is a typical day for me Wake (fasting about 11 hours): 12.6 (227) Before dinner (fasting 5-6 hours) 10.8 (195) 1 Hour after dinner 10.2 (184) 2 Hours after dinner 10.2 (184) Before bed 10.2 (184) It doesn't seem to matter if I eat nothing but leaf lettuce for 2 days; or try a high fiber cereal or a piece of fruit with lunch; my blood sugar gravitates to 10.2 like its trying to maintain that. Eating seems to make my BG drop just slightly; and I never seem to get a post meal spike. The worst thing I can do is stop eating.. the longer I fast; the higher my BG goes. I've seen this patter every day since I started testing 16 days ago. Is this just a sign that my body went too long with undiagnosed diabetes; my pancreas is dead; and I need insulin? Are these BG levels a patter of an insulin dependent type 2 diabetic that isn't on insulin? If eating doesn't increase my BG; would insulin not be dangerous? Anyone with any insight; I would really appreciate your comments. Thanks!,2013,2013,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello! We have been ttc for over a year now and I'm seeing an RE ( I have endo-severe; and my husband has very poor morphology 2% strict criteria). I went in for an ultrasound today and they said that my ovaries look "borderline" polycystic with 10-20 follicles on each (I'm on day 4 of my cycle). I have regular periods every 30 days; and NO other symptoms whatsoever. Can you make a diagnosis of PCO or PCOS just by ultrasound(this is my second one someone has mentioned this)? If so; If I am making a mature follicle every month is there a benifit to going on metformin as well; or will this further affect my fertility? I have used an OPK a couple of times late in my cycle (the last week of it) and had a positive OPK (LH surge) could that also add to the diagnosis of PCO? thank you for any help!,2007,2008,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,diagnosed 1996. tried all kinds of diet managements. exercise is restricted due to 1 1/2 in differential between leg lengths. metformin intake is 850 X 3 daily and 35u of lantus. numbers at testing run 180+. can get it down to 120 - 160 during the day. overnight 125 went down to below 80 and i awoke in sweats and so dizzy i had to eat. All this in an attempt to manage my glucose levels and have an A1C below 7. I don't get what I'm measuring and exactly how what I eat; when I eat it affects my level. Any suggestions?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 a few years ago. Last year my vision was blurred and my glucose was in the 500s; so they put me on Victoza. It worked like a charm; felt better right away. Now I am in the "donut-hole" in my insurance and so it now costs $400 whereas before it was $40. So naturally I had to stop using it and just use the Metformin. I have exhausted my resources for getting free samples of Victoza from my diabetes educator. Now every morning my fingers on both of my hands are so asleep and stiff that I cannot use them. Throughout the day it gets better but still tingles. About every week my left thigh becomes all of a sudden numb and tingly. What should I do? I checked my glucose is normal. What are these symptoms? I am 50 years old.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with type 2 many years ago but I was in denial. Now I can see ignoring my condition was just about the dumbest thing I could have done. I do take metformin 2x per day but that is about all I do. I am at least 100 pounds overweight have pain from neuropathy and feel tired all the time. When I say "all the time" I mean from the moment I wake up in the morning I could go back to sleep. I was given gaba something for pain but it does not work. I take a low dose pain pill only at night which seems to help but not always. My doctor want me to consider having gastric sleeve surgery (claims it will improve all of my numbers to include blood pressure). I guess my question is .... is it normal to be this tired and sleepy all the time? Is it my blood sugar that is causing this? Should I consider gastric sleeve surgery?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi everyone. My name is Pete and I'm new to the site/forum. I recently had a company-paid-for wellness screening. They did an array of blood tests and I wasn't too thrilled with the results. The most distressing of the batch was my Hemoglobin A1c...which was 11%...Some background: I'm 28 years old and have been fairly healthy. My blood pressure has been borderline and in the past year I've lost about 28 pounds and are down to around 264 now. I try to eat fairly well and only really eat out maybe once or twice a week. I don't get too much exercise besides what I do at work; (which involves a lot of walking around but nothing too athletic really). My father is a Type-II diabetic who got his when he was something like 48 years old. Neither my brother; sister or mother have it but I know diabetes runs in my father's side of the family. Needless to say I'm kind of freaking out a little bit because I really don't want to go down the road of having to take insulin or becoming a full-blown insulin-dependent diabetic. What can i do to lower my A1c levels???,2010,2010,27,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,i have been trying to get pregnant now for about 8 months I found out that i have PCOS; i started off taking clomid then had a HSG test done everything came back normal no blockage then i started taking Femera got pregnant ended up in a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. The very next month i got pregnant again but it ended up being an eptopic pregnancy. this broke my heart; 2 days ago they did an emergency lapascopy surgery which ended up with them removing my left fallopian tube. I still have both my overies and my right fallopian tube what do you think my chances of concieving will be only having one falopian tube and pcos. My periods were never very normal and as you know i already had a little bit of trouble getting pregnant in the first place.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Im a 33 yr old over-weight female; with high blood pressure; pre-diabetic (insulin resistant) and now cholesterol issues! I really need some advice; help; answers!!! I also suffer from health anxiety and it concentrates on my "heart".... I do take a low dose of lisinopril which keeps my bp regulated; Metformin Er for the pre-diabetic which is under control and I have not taken anything for the cholesterol (it scares me to death) My cholesterol was total 227; tri 163; hdl 38; ldl 161 and vldl 33. My problem is I don't think my cholesterol is that bad and she didn't give me a chance to get it down with exercise before prescribing me medication! Its just like I never feel very good anymore and I want to get to feeling good and in better health but I want to improve things without medication!!! How can I do this??!!,2007,2013,33,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 41 year old female with a history of hard to control hypertension (currently on four meds for this). I also have type II diabetes; although it is under control with metformin. I have recently been diagnosed with silent strokes; according to an MRI. There appear to be about 5-6 white matter lesions that the neurologist believes is related to this. A VEP was normal. He also dx me with complicated migraines and periphreal neuropathy (balance problems). Here are my questions: 1) Can they tell; from the MRI; how old the silent strokes are? 2) How low does my BP need to be in order to avoid future silent strokes? 3) My BP does not run sky high; but marginally high. Could this cause silent strokes? 4) Does the brain "recover" from silent strokes? Will the white matter lesions go away? 5) Aren't I quite young to have had this number of silent strokes? What should I expect in the future? 6) I have had some episodes of mental confusion and my cognitive abilities seem to be a bit diminished (my typing speed and accuracy have dropped; for example). Could this be from the silent strokes? Can this come and go; or will it only get worse? 7) The doctor put me on 325 mg of aspirin to avoid future silent strokes. The aspirin causes great problems with already heavy menstrual periods. Are there any other ways to help avoid future silent strokes? 8)In the future; when I fill out medical forms; do I indicate that I have had a stroke? Or not? Are silent strokes considered actual strokes? Thank you very much for your time; Ramona,2002,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,About 3 months ago my husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Recently he started having a lot of joint pain. Now his ankles and feet are swelling. His sugar levels are doing great. We have been to the doctor and he has had several test done. Everything is coming back good. Has anyone had these same symptoms? He is taking Metformin and I am wondering if this has anything to do with this.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I prepared the following write-up as a reference and introduction for when and how insulin should be started:- This write-up is for general information and should not replace the advice of your Dr. Please working closely with your Dr. for appropriate treatment of diabetes. Insulin should be used by any person who is not consistently achieving target blood sugar goals with lifestyle measures and 1 – 2 oral medications. Persons with Type 1 or Type 1.5 (both of which are autoimmune) should use insulin either alone or in combination with appropriate insulin sensitisers (usually metformin) if there is insulin resistance. So what should blood sugar goals be? These are very individual; but should be formulated with consideration that truly normal blood sugars in people who are non-diabetic would consist of fasting blood sugars typically in the low 80s; and post eating blood sugars that rarely if ever exceed 100 (and then not by much). A truly non-diabetic HbA1c is in the 4s. (Bernstein says 4.3 – 4.6). Consider also that diabetic complications (eye; circulatory; nervous system damage) are known to start occurring when blood sugars are consistently over 100; and the rate of complications increase markedly with blood sugars over 140. Complications are also known to increase exponentially with every 1% rise in HbA1c over 5.0 . I personally believe that optimal target blood sugars should be those recommended for pregnancy:- 80 – 120 (target fasting < 95; 1.5 – 2 hrs post eating < 120); and never over 140. An optimal HBa1c in the low to mid 5 range. This can be a pretty tough target to achieve and takes the right tools; knowledge; and skills; taking a combination of lifestyle measures (diet and exercise) and medication (correct timing; carb counting; etc). As a cautionary note though; such “tight” control may not be appropriate for everyone. However; ADA and other agencies do recommend that HbA1c below 6.5 should be targeted for most people. Insulin should then be used to keep blood sugars as close as possible to non-diabetic blood sugars; but while also avoiding low blood sugar. Insulin should also be used with careful and frequent testing to determine blood sugar patterns and to ensure that highs are treated appropriately and lows are avoided. When starting insulin; there are 3 options:- 1. Add a long acting insulin (once or twice a day) to normalize base insulin levels. This is particularly appropriate if fasting blood sugars are high; but post eating levels are ‘normal’. 2. Add a short acting insulin before meals (or before selected meals) to prevent post meal highs. This is appropriate if fasting insulin is normal but blood sugars go high after eating. It may also be used only for selected meals; if there are only some meals / foods that cause problems. 3. Add both a long acting and a short acting insulin. Initial doses may be very low (even 1/2 to 1 unit is still a valid dose) in cases where insulin is started early while pancreas is still working to some extent. This approach supports the pancreas so it can work comfortably within its remaining capacity (and hopefully will stay working for longer); while preventing the havoc that continually high blood sugars can bring. When adjusting insulin; start low and go slow. Test frequently; particularly when making changes / taking up exercise and work closely with your Dr. or qualified diabetes educator. Diabetes doesn’t cause complications! High Blood Sugar (from uncontrolled diabetes) causes complications.,2007,2013,42,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mother is 59 years old. No hx of colon cancer in our family; although her father had benign colon polyps in his 70s. No history of any kind of cancer in family. My Mother is healthy except for high bp and type 2 diabetes. She is on bp med; metformin; 1 aspirin per day and i cant remember what other meds. She has been on this medifast diet for about maybe 5 years. She eats this medifast "food" and then a salad and chicken for dinner. She is very much a wine-drinker. So anyway; for several years she says that sometimes when straining; she passes blood with stool. Assumed it was a hemorrhoid so paid no attention to it. Just occasional blood in stool. In the past few months; there is more blood with stool and she has mostly diarrhea when she goes. Not a lot of formed stools now. OK so about a month ago; there started to be small amounts of mucous with the stool (and still blood). Now in the past 2 weeks; the blood and mucous are even more volume. and it is every time. She says sometimes she will feel like she has to poop; and goes poop and it is only a lot of blood-tinged mucous and nothing else. Straight pooping mucous. Over a month ago the doctor told her that she has no occult blood IN the stool. So the blood is coming out only when pooping or diarrhea. Blood does not leak out any other time. Only when poop. She has no fever. NO pain whatsoever; no fatigue; same appetite and otherwise feels normal. No pain at all. No weakness. But is very concerned about the large amounts of mucous now and blood; especially increasing over the past 2 weeks. Does this sound like cancer or what does it sound like? She has a colonoscopy scheduled for 4 days from now - but we are all terrified.,2008,2013,40,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,A few years ago my girlfriend had been told that she showed she had hepatitis b antibodies; but had already cleared the infection and was now immune.Just the other day she got a call from her doctor and told her she had active hepatitis b again. Is there any way that this is possible? She is also diabetic; and we wonder if a weakened immune system would let the virus reassert itself; but I have never heard of that happening before.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,On July 13; my husband had fasting bloodwork done at his cardiologist's office. On Tuesday; July 20; he was told his blood sugar was 312. He doesn't go back to see the doctor until this coming Tuesday; July 27. I'm very concerned - he is taking nothing to control his blood sugar; so will it continue to climb? He has not been diagnosed diabetic (I assume that's coming this Tuesday!); but there is a family history )both parents; aunts; cousins). He's not feeling well at all - no energy; sleepy; pain in his legs all the time. Is it safe to wait until his doctor's appointment or should I take him to the ER? I'm very worried.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,After 6 months of watching diet for diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes; I started taking Meformin. Right before I started taking Metformin; headaches began. They are very frequent; sharp on the right side; feel pressure throughout temple-eyes-ears; have one spot middle of back of head that sort of tingles most of the time - very annoying at night; headaches are horrible when getting up from sitting position and coughing; Alieve helps in about an hour but don't want to become dependent on any over the counter medicine; would rather know the cause and work on that. I have been driving quite a bit (5000 miles each month) in different climates so I have not ruled out sinus headaches - they just don't have a rhyme or reason to when they start or stop. Lying down at night is hard to find a position; sometimes starts a headache. Mornings are typically very good - headache starting afternoon most days. Worried about secondary brain cancer and primary brain cancer or some other disease such as meningitis. Neck is stiff on both sides and also has sharp pain from time to time which also starts a headache. Eyes feel pressure; throat feels thick. I do have a goiter and have been on thyroid medicine for about 30 years - have it checked regularly. Nothing else has changed. Anyone have any ideas or know how to rule out some things;. I don't even know which doctor type to see. Thanks...,2010,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have infertility and miscarriage issues; so after discussing my issues with a doctor I work for; he ran ordered some blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound to look for PCOS. I was pre-ovulatory by 1 week. FSH; LH; Fasting Glucose; Prolactin; Testosterone (am); Estradiol; DHEAS; and Fasting Insulin all came back completely normal. TSH came back as 7.38 and I am now on Synthroid 0.075 mg. I am also on Metformin 2000 mg qd; started about 8 months ago for a slightly elevated fasting insulin level. He gave me a copy of the results but unfortunately did not have time to discuss them with me; so I'm not sure of what to make of the results: "The uterus currently has normal size. It measures 6.3 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm. It is retroverted. The endometrium has a normal thickness of 7 mm. The ovaries have a normal size; the right estimated to be about 8 cc and the left left 7 cc. Each contain a number of small follicles. This could be compatible with polycystic disease but this diagnosis would need to be established clinically." Based on this interpretation and the blood results would this be compatible with PCOS?,2008,2008,31,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 53 year old male diabetic and have been on insulin for the last 25 years. My current A1C is 7.5 . My average daily insulin requirement is about 80 units A recent test showed the following results: GAD - AB < 5 IU / mL C-Peptide 2.6 ng/ml I had fasted overnight for the tests. In addition to diabetes; I also have radiation induced Hypothyroidism and take 125 mcg of Synthroid. I also have heart disease with EF of 30%. Had CABG (2 vessels) 10 years ago and have an implanted defibrillator. My recent lipid readings are HDL 37 mg/dL Triglycerides 62 mg/dL LDL 80 mg/dL Total Cholesterol 133 mg/dL I take Crestor (20 mg) and Trilipix (135 mg) to control lipids. I also take metaprolol (100 mg) ; Lissinopril ( 10 mg); aspirin ( 85 mg) and Effient (10 mg) That was my background history; now the questions. 1. Since my C-Peptide and GAD-AB indicate that I am not Type I diabetic; was it a mistake of my Drs to put me on insulin ? After diagnosis I was on diet therapy for 5 years and then on oral medication for only 1 MONTH followed by insulin 2. If I am Type II; then would a combination of insulin and oral medication work better in my case ? Thanks.,2007,2012,51,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello again and thanks for your feedback. I have to clarify my results because I missed something in the interpretation from MMOL to mg/dl. My four readings are as follows: based on a 12 hr fast 2000- 85 2002- 90 2003- 106 2004- 115 2004- 85 Now I am confused - are these readings bad? My Dr said that because both my parents were diagnosed w/ Diabetis type 2 at age 50 and 55 I am at increased risk of getting it. He said to be careful and reduce my weight by 10 lbs and watch the sugars and things should be ok or at least I could prevent the onset for now. I am 39 and male all cholesteral results are normal and BP is very good. What do I make of this? Also are glucose monitors accurate? I bought one and reads at 85 (fasted 8 hrs)?,2004,2004,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,really would like your opinion please...I have been hypothyroid for 15 yrs. I have been unstable for the last 8 yrs. The doctors have changed my dosing every 2 months as my levels are outrageous. My last TSH was high at 13.0 and my T3 was 0.02 and my T4 was low (indicative of hyperthyroidism). The doctor is running several tests including a thryoid u/s. I have had abnormal weight gain in the last 2 months (30 lbs; and I have had gastric bypass). The doctors are puzzled as to why I cannot get regulated. My exam on Thurs my doc said my heart was skipping beats and I guess he felt nodules because he told me get the u/s asap. Any thoughts? We are all at our wits end here. I was on 250 mcg of Levothyroxine then lowered to 200 and now at 175. This is all within the last yr and 1/2. My tests are still all over the place.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been having trouble with my blood sugar numbers. My doctor asked that I come in and see the CNP. I did as requested and she along with my consent agreed to start me on Lantus. I have tried the Januvia; Actos; Byetta; etc and none of those have helped. We agreed that if my mealtime numbers continued to be high that we would use a bolus insulin such as Novolog. I contacted her and she was going to call in the Novolog. My numbers have remained high and I am begining to worry about long term effects. The physician decided that this was not the best course of treatment and stopped the script. I waited for an hour at the pharmacy. I called the next morning and we kind of had issues. She said that I want to play physician and that the numbers of her diabetic patients are some of the best in the city. Maybe I need a new doctor she says. She agreed to give me Starlix. I have been taking this for two days now and I do not see a difference. My question is what could her concern be for me to not take the Novolog? She stated weight gain. Although from what I read about Starlix a main side effect is weight gain. Why did she send me to her nurse practioner and then not trust her opinion? I am currently looking for another doctor. There is a wonderful endocrinologist that I am trying to see but he is not taking new patients at the moment. I have another patient of his trying to get me the hookup.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was curious if anyone has had any experience with blood sugar problems as a result of Hep C. I have been noticing that sometimes after I eat (especially lunch for some reason) that I seem to crash. I get real tired where I take a nap at work sometimes. I have read that hep C can cause blood sugar abnormalities. There is a history of Diabetes in my family (brother and father) and I am about 30 lbs overweight so it could be that. I am going to schedule a test with my doctor. I've had them in years past and been fine but i am wondering if it could be from the hep c. Anyone else ever experience this?,2006,2006,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,hello; I am 51 years old from bahrain; I discovered since 2 years that i have diabetic type 2. I never went to a doctor but I have a glucose meter and i always; i check my sugar it is mostly around 6;8 to 9;5 but some times it gos to 11 and rarly to 12 melli mole. my hba1c is 6.1%. i mostly take care about my diet but some times i ignore it. my weight is 92 kg. and i am 172 cm tall. i normaly take herbs like zater or diabetic water made in bahrain. do you advice me to take insulin?. This discussion is related to How do i lower my hemoglobin A1c?.,2010,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am having trouble keeping my blood sugar in control. I will confess that I have not been dilligent with my diet and exercise. My latest A1c was 7.3. I am taking 850 mg of Metformin twice a day. My morning blood sugar is around 200. I am close to or over 200 for most of the day as well. I have decided that until I can lose weight and get my numbers in control that way that insulin might be a good choice for me. I am afraid that it constantly being that high is going to cause damage. I have tried other medications such as Actos and Januvia but they did not make that big a difference. I tried the Byetta as well with the same results. So I am not afraid of needles or injections. My question would be which insulin pens would be my best choice? I think a long acting such as Lantus and I might need a rapid acting one for meals? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I am going to see the nurse practioner today in my doctor's office. I also am a member on the Thyroid boards with having Hashimoto's disease as well. Thanks in advance for your help.,2010,2013,47,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I need some suggestions for pain relief. Lately my body has been soo stiff; like I've actually worked hard all day and my IBS is acting up terribly. I have tried Tramadol; T3's and Amitriptine (sorry can't spell it) but nothing seems to do the trick. I've also had bad sleeps; I can't remember the last time I've fallen asleep before 3am. I've done all the over-the-counter stuff but seriously I am suffering so bad as of late. My stomach and bowels are driving me insane! I also suffer from PCOS and am currently taking the lowest dose of Metformin. I really need some suggestions for pain medications because I can't do this for much longer!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husbands new doctor ( endocrinologist) put him on the Novolog flex pin. He said that my husband AC1 level means he will end up blind or on dialysis. Does this mean this is for certain? My husband currently takes lisinopril; lipitor; metaformin; lantus injections 18mm; Novolog 5 unites ( before meals); and glyburide. He is only 39 years old and has gotten to the point where he will call off of work 4 out of 5 times a week from feeling ill. I am very worried but I dont tell him because he is the " tough guy." Do you think this is a medical disability at this point and how can I be supportive without making him feel uncomfortable?,2008,2008,32,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My doctor thinks I may have metabolic syndrome. He is doing a multitude of blood testing. I am awaiting the results. The last blood work in February from another doctor was fine except triglycerides and total cholesterol were high and B12 was 195; low; glucose 90 which was normal. With my symptoms I have been having he is doing more testing. He is going to do another complete workup with blood testing and this time test my insulin level fasting along with CMP; thyroid; CBC; B12; can't remember what else. He feels that even though my glucose was normal my insulin may be high. Question is; if my insulin is high is that insulin resistance? Can I be on my way to Type II diabetes if I am resistant? I have not had a glucose tolerance test done yet? Should I consider that if the insulin level comes back abnormal? I have studies diabetes in nursing school but if you have ever been to nursing school you know they go through different diseases so fast and you actually learn just the basics of every disease. I don't have anybody that I can think of that has diabetes in my family either so I am not that familiar with diabetes. I would just like some advice from people who deal with diabetes and what to ask my doctor just in case my insulin levels are abnormal; like what kind of extra blood test would help. He is just a small town country doctor in a very small town and I am not saying anything bad about him but I know big city docs see more than these small town docs. And lets face it. docs see so many patients a day and they are so busy that sometimes they can forget to order a certain test that can help identify the problem. I am sorry to ramble it is just that I have been healthy all my life except for mild gastrointestinal symptoms. I have always been very athletic and now I am 34 years old; (not very old to be falling apart); I have arthritis in several joints; probably due to all the gymnastics; basketball and track and all the pounding I have put on my joints; I was recently diagnosed with adenomatous polyps which they told me were the precancerous type that they removed (my grandmother had cancerous polyps removed before her death; death due to her female cancer coming back and spreading all over her body); hips have bursitis in them; I get steroid injections in my right shoulder by my doc due to impingement syndrome but refuse a MRI for right now; he wants to check for a rotator cuff tear (work for orthopedics; so they keep trying to get me to get injections in my hips but I don't won't them to see my fat hips); I am overweight for the first time in my life by 30-35 lbs (my mother is severely overweight so I am fighting my overweight problem now before it gets way out of hand). And for the past couple of years I have been extremely fatigued and have no energy; thinning hair(not too bad); very dry skin (which I have never had). My doc I have gotten two B12 shots so far and that is helping me feel better but still not quite there. So there is my story; sorry to ramble but just had to get it all out there. Noboby understands how I feel and my husband just thinks I am a hypochondriac; but he hates going to doctors. Any advice would be appreciated or just someone telling me I know how you feel I am in the same boat.,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08; Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight; when there is no logical reason for it. Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone); PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal; just started Metformin therapy). On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June; my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a "normal" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website; but no mention was made to me; at my followup appt. On 01-06-10; I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit; my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again; no mention was made of this; although; in his defense; my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels; at this visit; which were very much out of range. I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here; as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59; for a woman; is suggestive of possible kidney damage; and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop; as they have in my case. I am obese (240 lbs); so I know that can affect the numbers; but I also have been plagued; over the yrs; with various auto-immune issues (ITP; Hashimoto's); and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes; that adds yet another concern. Can anyone with knowledge in this area advise if there's reason for concern? Thanks; Angela,2007,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi everyone; I accidently came across this forum when actually looking for another topic. I am glad this is here and that I see some familiar names from other boards I frequent. :-) I haven't been diagnosed with an adrenal disorder; but I believe it is not far off from happening. I have a big round of testing coming up (can't remember them all... I'll find the list and post it). In the mean time; I was hoping someone could help me control my symptoms. First my background and current diagnosises: Prolactinoma - Cabergonline .5 mg weekly Hashimotos - Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily High Blood Pressure and super fast heart rate - some medication that starts with an N. :-P Depression/Anxiety - Lexapro 10 mg daily Vitamin D Definancy - 2000 iu daily PCOS/Type 2 diabetes - Metformin I have flank pain in times of slight/severe stress (used to only be when it was severe; but now it's anytime I feel even nervous or defensive). Drastic mood changes; nausea & diarreha worst in the morning and gradually gets better through the day; night time I have the most energy; sleep disturbances; thirst; salt craving; dizziness; weight gain that won't stop!; etc. Any help or suggestions on how to make myself feel better would be great! Also could any of my diagnosises be related to each other and if so is there a treatment I could do that could really help me out tremendously instead of treating them one by one?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My father has type 2 diabetes and has been on several medications which did not lower his BS. Metformin caused problems with his kidneys; gilp izide which bottomed out his blood sugar and he ended up in the ER. He was started on Januvia and Actos which helped but my mom was worried about the bladder cancer scare with actos so the doctor discontinued the actos. She gave us some samples of Victoza and he has been on Januvia and Victoza for several months and it has worked well and we are happy with the combination. Yesterday we called the pharmacy to see if his RX for Januvia was ready for pick up he said the insurance has denied the claim. Dad has Humanna Gold; so I called them and they said that when the Victoza was added ther combination threw up a safety alert because they are both in the same class. I called his doctor and she said that they act on the liver in a similar action but that those medications are commonly given together with good results. So I called the insurance company and they said they put me on hold and came back and said they would review it and to call back in 24 hours. The doctor called me back to tell me they called her and told her that they were going to deny the claim due to duplicate drugs. She said she has documentation to show that this combination works for my dad where no others did and she would send it to them. His response was "I am not interested." My question is how much power does the insurance company have to interfear with the physician and the client? Is there a state or federal insurance commission that oversees the conduct of the insurance company? The decision to deny this claim could not have been reviewed by a board of physicians while I was put on hold on the phone. The person who called dads doctor was not a doctor and he denied the claim on the spot. What can we do?,2012,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 57 year old woman with Type II diabetes. I've also been diagnosed with HepC several years ago and was non-responsive to the Interferon/Riboviron regimen. The treatment made me very ill and I experienced very debilitating depression. Since that treatment; I've noticed how my forearms bruise and cut easily. I don't heal like I used to. I started juicing almost a year ago; avoid GMO foods; I eat more fish; lots of vegetables and drink lots of water. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. I quit all that 20 years ago. Had 6 children. I've been training for a Marathon and have been enjoying the challenges and the results too. I've been able to maintain close to normal glucose levels without Metformin; and I test 3 - 4 times a day. The skin on my legs look good; my face and hair; but when I look at my forearms I want to cry. I use special makeup to cover it up. It's just my forearms. Seems I never see them without the ugly bruises; scars & cuts. Why is this happening to me? My kidney function was normal; It's the first time in years my blood tests came back normal. My A1C was slightly elevated; but down from 10.4 to 6.9. Am I vitamin deficient? This discussion is related to marks/bruises that don't heal.,2014,2014,,

In march; 2014 i got the complete treatment and the blood tests and urine tests confirms the same. However; my doctor pointed out that there was some sugar in my urine; so i got tested for Blood sugar; and have been diagnosed for type 2 diabetes. My doctor prescribed me Metformin (1500 mg daily). While i started taking the medicine; after a few weeks; i started feeling stiffness in my fingers in the morning. it gradually has spread to other joints and bones as well in a few weeks time. i regularly feel week and lazy. also i have noticed white tongue since last couple of weeks and have been taking fluconazole 150 mg for last 10 days...although no benefit. fearing that it might be rheumatoid arthritis i got a panel test done. the test results shows everyting in the range.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband is getting to the end of the road and is getting nowhere with the hospital and doctor saying they don't know what the problem is and don't know what to do. Diagnosis Undertaken: Ultrasound of liver & kidneys Scope into intestines & bowel Blood tests General checks Symptoms: When on no medication he is unable to tolerate food; he is sick after eating and ends up with severe abdominal pain. More Information: He has been on Orlistat for 3 years which relieved all the stomach pains but it has weakened the lining of the rectum and he now gets long term fissures whilst taking it and it cannot be prescribed longer than 3 years so he has no choice but to come off it. When off it he gets the symptoms above. The pain has meant he is unable to hold down a job and he is now suffering depression from the ongoing pain and affect on his life.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi to all I finnally have gotten around to to ask why endo put me on metformin with and average reading of 105? I called my sis because my brother-in-law is diabetic. His blood sugar was over 360. I have been seeing this endo for almost 2 years for my throidlessness. I do not trust him any more as I am not diabetic. I feel he is out to more insurance money from Tricare the military insurance. I did take the metformn for about 2 weeks and I felt no different.I still had 105 averages.The highest it ever read was 134 after a pasta dinner. I am getting rid of the endo. I dont take the metformin.I am not diabetic. I am turning over all my medical issues over to my primary care doc at the base I am throidless; bi polar and I am not diabetic. Thanks for reading this. I felt like I just need to talk with others that have more experience with diabetes I do worry about getting diabetes as my paternal grandmother and my father both developed type II. ao I am watching my diet and loosing weight.I stopped drinking sodas diet and regular and I have dropped from198 to 185 in 2 weeks.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My Husband just told me two days ago that he has diabetes. He's 48 and just slightly overweight- this was quite a surprise to us. He had a fasting glucose of ~300 and A1C of 7.8. He was put on metformin 500 1x/day. I guess I'm having a tough time really understanding what he's going through right now. We were just married in January and he's 18 years older than I am. We have had a few discussions about what this means for our lifestyle and how he feels about this. The only feeling I get from him is that he feels he's letting me down by not being as healthy as he thought he was.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Age: 35 Sex: Male Weight: 134Kg Height: 1.95cm Diagnosed Conditions: Hypothyroid (mild); Type 2 Diabetes Medications: Indapamide 1.5mg; Simvastatin 40mg; Metformin 1000mg; Levothyroxine 75mcg Familial Conditons: Aschaemic Heart Disease; Hypothyroidism; Diabetes. Rheumatic fever at age 10 (1987) suffering from endocarditis and arthritic knees; ankles; wrists and elbows; recovery took 3 months. At age 14 (1991) diagnosed with Tricuspid Valve leaf out of sync; 1 leaf opening and closing after other 2; resulting in orthostatic hypotension and loss of vision for around 10-15 seconds per episode. Advised by cardiologist that unless symptoms became disabling I should leave alone and see if I "grow out of it" and perhaps in adult life may require attention as and when. Echocardiogram tests performed in 2007 showed no regurgitation and normal ECG; despite minor pain on exertion; GNT discontinued due to headache associated with use; activity levels reduced to compensate. Now aged 35 I am experiencing palpitations and shortness of breathe at rest which is exacerbated during rest from exertion; very mild chest pain (similar to tooth ache) upon exertion rising to collarbone and left shoulder. Admitted to hospital ( 2 days ago) for 24 hours observation following mild tachycardia (135bpm) and very high blood pressure (180/120) at GP appointment. During observation ECG normal; pulse rate did not go below 115; BP lowest 140/102; negative for MI protein. Treadmill stress test duration 4 mins 55 seconds (average I'm told is 11 mins) BP highest at test 220/165; Pulse 165; Lowest 195/145; Pulse 130; ECG throughout normal; although when I took a peak there were some pauses between beats wider than others; similar to what I've researched to be arrhythmia. Consultant recommends Angiogram to determine cause of pain. Is it normal for tricuspid valve behavior to change or has something been missed on a previous Echo ? Anything else I should be asking to be done ? Thanks,2012,2012,34,Male

I knew I hadn't been feeling well and having loose stools accompanied with stomach cramps 3-4 times a day but gaining weight rapidly which is what urged me to go to the dr. for testing. I am 29 years old; 5'1" and 145 lbs. My typically weight is no more than 110... so this jump in weight is a HUGE deal! Anyhow... the last few weeks when something causes sudden stress... maybe an arguement or for instance yesterday I was working with police detectives on a sting to find a person who broke into my car and stole a lot of things... Normally when I have something that causes very sudden stress; I can feel my face and ears redden; heart rate increase; senses heightened and a bit jittery. Normal; I'd pressume. The last 2 instances of sudden stress after all those initial things happen... I have been getting a horrible aching; stabbing pain in the area of my kidneys. Both. This seems odd to me. Today; I am still feeling aches in my kidney's but also in the area that my right overy would be located. The frontal pain was bad enough to fully wake me when I tried to sit up a tad to see over my husband this morning to look at the clock. Any ideas?????? (PS. I also posted this question in the diabetes forum),2008,2008,29,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband had what we thought was a Heart Attack last week; when we got to the hospital & they did some test; they told us he has Aneuresym's in his Arteries of his heart & that there is severe placque build up. They sent us home the next day too see his new Cardiologist in 2 weeks as well as blood thinner (baby asprin; High Cholesterol meds; rest; etc). What can we expect from this & is this a common thing?All his friends say we need a 2nd opinion; but feel like we haven't even got to talk to his doctor & received all the answers to our questions. Can someone please ease my mind a little?,2012,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had my A1C tested the other day right at my doctor's office - it was almost an "instant read" type of thing - nurse put the sample in a machine and had the reading in about 5 minutes. (I have no idea what type of machine i twas though; sorry). She said my A1c was good - it was a 6. What is the "normal" range for an A1C? I've recently been diagnosed with T2. My initial glucose test (not the A1C) was listed as high on teh sheet from the lab; however; my doc said it was actually in the borderline area (I can't find the actuall lab report to give you exact numbers). Anyway; he prescribed me a monitor to test at home; as well as put me on Metformin and Glimeperide. He actually gave me the monitor a month before putting me on the meds. during the month that I was testing; but was not on any meds; my sugar levels were pretty irratic - lowest was 88 and highest was 263 - during this month I also ended up coming down with a horrible case of bronchitis and severe asthma attack; so did end up on antibiotics; cough meds; as well as a steroid shot; oral steroids and a steroid inhaler as well as my "normal" ventolin inhaler and albuterol nebulizer. At any rate; the strange thing (or strange to me) is that my highest sugar numbers actually occurred BEFORE I was put on the steroids rather than after being on them. I know they can and do affect your blood sugar (unfortunatley have had to be on them many times in my life so I'm pretty familiar with their side effects) - but this time it seemed my blood sugars actually became somewhat more regulated while I was on the meds. Since being on the Metformin and Glimeperide; my numbers (I think) have been pretty good. My first am reading (before any food or drink) has been running between 85-103 and post-meal (2 hours after) haven't gotten any higher than 150. I have; however; had a couple of instances of lower blood sugars that have left me feeling quite shaky; headachy; etc. - lowest being 67 and I most definitely KNEW my blood sugar was low then - I drank some juice and it came up to a point where I felt better. Doc has now increased the Metformin from 500mg twice daily to 1000 mg twice daily; but has left the Glimepiride at 1mg once daily (that low blood sugar reading was before the metformin had been incrased) Does my A1C number sound correct? Does the increase in metformin; but staying the same wiht the other med seem logical since my numbers had already come down with the lower dose of metformin and I had had a couple of instances of low blood sugar that caused symptoms? I'm completely new to all this blood sugar testing; T2; etc.; so I'm tryin gto gather all information I can to make this "transition" easier on myself and also so maybe I can know more of what is "normal" to feel/expect and what are some things to be on teh look out for. The informational sheets that you get from the pharmacy with your meds are great; but getting first hand information from others I think is even better. Thank you!,2009,2011,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,What would cause my husband's blood sugar levels to always be high? We discovered he was diabetic 2 1/2 years ago when he had a very; very severe pancreatic attack. Taken by ambulance to the hospital and stayed in ER for about 8 hours. When we returned home; it was only 20 minutes before we were in the car rushing to the hospital again. This time they kept him for 2 weeks. Ok; thats the history. Now I would like to know about these high numbers. He has even gotten as high as almost hitting 400. His average is 220 to 320. It's been a long time since he had too low of numbers and that only happened a few times. He takes metformin and tricor for the diabetes; as well as several other medications such as methadone (for pain); vicodin (only occationally) and ativan for anxiety. He gets blood tests about every 4 months; but the doctor doesn't seem to care very much to resolve this. He only goes to our family doctor because the specialist is an hour away and we just can't afford the gas. Are these constant high numbers dangerous; or could they be 'his normal'?,2010,2010,55,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Has anyone heard of PGX? Its apparently a natural supplement that works very well with diabetic people and insulin resistant people. I talked to a woman who said her husband has type 2 diabetes. They had him on metformin but it gave him too many side effects; so now he is on PGX and he has lost weight and feels great! this stuff apparently lowers the GI of the foods you eat; and allows your body to process it slower so that you dont get hungry as fast and crave food constantly! Has anyone tried it? Is anyone on metformin who needs to get off of it because of unwanted side effects? Fill me in!,2008,2008,21,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My mother (75yrs) is having surgery tomorrow morning (bilateral mastectomy); it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently; over the last couple of weeks her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis; particularly when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I am 29 year old female with PCOS I have been on Metformin for a little over a year. Initially the metformin caused some hypoglycemia and I had to eat often and check my blood glucose. The Hypoglycemia lasted roughly about 3 months while I adjusted to the Metfromin and since have not had any issues. I started loosing weight at the end of February; begining of March. I like most with PCOS had an extremely difficult time loosing weight for years and I had my weight checked at my routine Endo. appt. on February 22nd I weighed 186. Starting in March I began having swollen lymph nodes in my neck (worst in the back of my neck) and severe fatigue the Dr. told me it was mono (which I have already had before in highschool) and to rest and I would feel better in a few weeks. I have had a major amount of symptoms that have gotten worse and worse with a drastic loss in weight without doing a single work out; I am too tired to exercise anyway. I am currently weighing in at 143lbs and began getting very sick last week. Shaking; dibilitating nausea; Complete lack or drive to eat anything; low drops in heart rate wear my heart feels weird as it beats ( in the 60s); Severe diareah; headaches and I am still expierencing neck swelling; pain and back ache. I went into my GP last friday who decided to check my blood suagr and it was 61. This was most concerning cause I drank a 20 oz Orange juice about an hour before the appointment. He felt like my metformin was causing a random hypoglycemic reaction out of the blue? He also felt like my thyroid was enlarged and my neck appeared swollen. He ordered some blood work and another ultrsound of my thyroid ( my last one a year ago said slightly enlarged 1 yr ago with a small nodule; they planned on just watching it every 6 mo) my thyroid bloodwork came normal. I told him of all the symptoms and he suggested I make an appointment with my endo. quick. He pulled me off of my metformin for 3 days and there was no change in symptoms he also had me eat every two hours and check my blood glucose every two hours. I am having significant drops within two hours after eating anything at all. the symptoms are just getting worse. My endo said he thinks something is wrong with my adrenal gland? He said it sounds like this "reactive hypoglycemia" is caused by a possible case of addisons. I did a 24 hour urine test yesterday and turned it in today along with like 12 viles of bloodwork requested by my endo so I wont have labs for a cpl days. I should get my thyroid ultrasound back today or tomorrow. They said it has grown since last year and the radiologist is comparing the size difference I also have multiple new cysts growing on my thyroid but again bloodwork is normal??? As soon as I get all my new labs and urin study I will post them as well should be in the next couple days... I am hoping someone can tell me whats going on I have never felt so terrible and i am scared about how low I am dropping in blood glucose... Thanks in advance!! Symptoms extreme weightloss with out any exersize SEVERE nausea Severe fatigue throat swelling and pain (mainly the back of the neck) Headaches back pain diareah EXTREME lack of desire to eat; not hungry at all (but I am forcing myself too every 2 hours) attack of reactive hypoglcemia Low heart rate(when glucose is low it is in the 60's) or rapid speeding heart rate ( when my glucose is above 90) My fasting glucose has been around 70 once I eat ( anything) it goes up to 104 at the mos;t and then within 2 hours from eating it is in the 40s and I feel violently ill and super dizzy.... Lost need any answers I have never had diabetes or anything like that!,2009,2012,4,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dr. Schiano; Well; I'll start with telling you a little about my health. I've type 2 diabetes; high cholesterol; high trig. (hereditary on mother's side). I was just diagnosed with Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Due to the diabetes and high cholesterol I was taking metformin 500 mg.'s once a day and lipitor 10 mg.'s once a day for about 6 yrs. now. I've now been taken off the medicine's now due to high liver enzymes. I was diagnosed with a fatty liver in 2008. I feel like I'm falling apart; the unknown is the worse. Anyhow; I just had a ultrasound done on my liver; pancreas; aorta and right kidney due to high liver enzymes. I had a attack about 4 yrs. ago with pain under my left breast that radiated around my left side in my back and shoulder area. Never did find out why. However; since that attack; I've to take beano before eating veggies and gas-x at times; or I've a discomfort. Unfortunately; I never did receive a diagnose as to what happened. Ok; so now; I will list my high liver enzymes: 3/24/12- Alanine Aminotransferase 59 U/L High 0-55 7/5/12-Aspartate Aminotransferase 57 U/L High 5-34 7/5/12-Alanine Aminotransferase 100 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/11/12-Aspartate 60 U/L High 5-34 Aminotransferase Alanine Aminotransferase 114 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/19/2012-Aspartate Aminotransferase 56 U/L High 5-34 Alanine Aminotransferase 118 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 Ok; so I'm told it's probably from the generic of lipitor; per the pharmacist the generic has the same ingredients as lipitor. She doesn't agree. Anyhow; I'm thinking the same because I've been off the lipitor since 7/6/12; and my enzymes are still climbing expect -Aspartate Aminotransferase did drop a little still not in normal range. Could the cause of my liver enzymes be because of the Hashi's? if so; is it dangerous to have high liver enzymes for a long period of time? I'm scheduled to see a gastro & Endocrinologist in Oct. but am afraid if something serious; it could be to late.,2012,2012,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My daughter has had several boughts of low bs that wouldn't respond to therapy. Her doctors were very suprised to find out that it took over 14 hours for her body to respond to carbs to bring it up from the 30's and 40's. They mention that she had "binding antibodies". I have researched this myself and can't find anything to help me understand what this is and how it is treated. If you know something about this subject; please help!,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all; My mom is 83 years old and has elevated glucose levels for about 5 years now. They rarely went over 150 and she has been able to control her glucose quite well through diet and exercise. But 2 months ago; she went into the hospital for 2 days for an unrelated issue & they fed her lots of high glycemic foods. Her doctor in the hospital said he was concerned she may have low blood sugar so my brothers fed her junk food and cake. When she got home; her glucose reading was 240 and that freaked her out. She returned to a good diet and her number dropped below 180. She went to her doctor for a routine visit and was very worried about her numbers so the doctor gave her xanax and glucophage. I got her to wait on both RX's and her numbers got down into the 130's - 140's with occasional 160's. She is good on her diet but slips a bit. She also walks over a mile 4 - 5 days a week. I just got her last lab results and her A1c was 6.5 & glucose was 128. I have a few questions: 1. Her glucose levels are always lower at the doc / hospital than home - could her testing equipment be bad? I changed the batteries a few times but doesn't seem to matter. 2. We prefer to keep her off glucophage as long as possible due to the possible side effects and not wanting another drug in her system at 83. What are people's thoughts on the benefit/need for meds at her current a1c level? 3. Her doctor shares very little info and when I went with her; he was angry when I asked questions. I found a better doctor but she is resistant to change although she doesn't like him - any ideas on how to persuade her? 4. How do I help her stay stricter on her diet - her weakness is white bread & noodles. I stocked her house with kamut pasta but when she makes food for my brothers; she uses white crap and then eats it herself. 5. My brothers think she should be left alone and I am too involved with helping her with her diet and that occasional sweets & white crap is ok - how do I educate them when they want to be in denial? It is hard doing it alone especially when they spend time with her and/or cook for her. BTW; I live in CA and she lives in IL - I fly there once a month for 4 or 5 days and stock her up on healthy foods and she does great when I am there. Work prevents me from more time with her. Thanks; Joey,2009,2010,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have had diabetes for 7 years at least now and im pregnant with my second child.. do any if you feel like the doctors make it hard to feel like you have a personal connection with your baby because they are constantly reminding you of all the negatives of having diabetes while pregnant. . I just went to the doc yesterday and I just feel like sad about this baby like im a bad mom or something. Mt first son had 4 holes in his heart at birth and the doc was saying that is likely top happen to this guy too or I could even carry full term and have to delivery a dead baby. I'm just all bleehhh today thinking about all this. Just venting I guess,2014,2015,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 48 year old female. I have a problem with total boby tingling upon waking; even my head and face; sometimes feeling like I have been breathing too shallow. This has been happening for about one yr. I occassionally have tingling throughtout the day in my legs; arms; and scalp. I spoke to my pcp about this problem and he said "That doesn't make since" and changed the subject. When sleeping I periodically wake with an arm; leg; or my side tingling. I also have periodic intense (so much as to wonder if something is broken) pain in different locations such as my shoulder; knee; neck; and back. It hurts for a day or two then goes away. I ask my pcp about "Fibromyagia" as my mother and sis have it but he said "no" and changed the subject. My labs at last physical looked normal except for chol. Surgeries I have had are C-section; gallbladder removal; angiogram (for chest pains; results showed left ventrical 37% blocked); carpel tunnel release (right and left). I have taken lisinopril 10mg or other bp meds.for 25 yrs.for high blood pressure; metformin 500mg. for 2 yrs for type 2 diabetes; aspirin 81mg. for 4 yrs.; and currently am not taking a chol med. (took lipitor for 2 yrs.; insurance co. did not want to pay for it- tried simvastatin and lovastatin but caused throat tightness and pain; and shortness of breath - have appt. with pcp to see what is next). I have a daily feeling of tiredness; fatigue; brain fog;and recently gained some weight.What could be causing this problem? What kind of Dr. should I see? Thank you.,2010,2010,47,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all My partner has Type 2 diabetes; he let his symptoms go for a while without medication but his blood sugar increased. So he went back on the medication about 2 months ago. He is taking Avandia 4mg twice a day; his GP said whilst presribing that 'the jury is still out on Avandia.' and he would review it next month. This made me google the drug and all I am getting is Avandia and lawsuits in relation to heart disease. Yes I would say the jury have retired on this one; what worries me more is that for about the last 3 weeks my partner has had pins and needles in his left arm and some pain. Should he stop these drugs now and look for an alternative; or am I being carried away by the hype. Sorry I haven't looked through the site to see if this has come up before. It is my first time posting to this forum but I am scared for him Jane,2002,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 54 yrs old. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last Novenber. I am currently taking metformin an 10mg of Byetta 2x daily. In JUne I started to ween myself off of paxil after being onit and prozac for the last 12yrs. I felt that I couldn't loose weight on paxil. I have to say it was hell getting off of paxil. I had brain zaps and every kind of side effect there was. It took more than 2 months to ween myself off. It's been abouat a month now. I did loose about 10lbs.I now feel depressed again and I'm afraid to go back on an anti depressant. I don't want to gain weight again. I am an emotional eater. I weigh 190 and want to loose 40lbs. Is there a way to loose weight and take an anti depressant?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Wanted to give you overview before asked my question. I've been dieting for the last two years because I gained over 90 pounds during my pregnancy and have only added weight on after it even with dieting (I stuck to weight watchers and then tried LA Weight Loss and nothing worked). I found out in addition to my autoimmune disorder (mixed connective tissue disease which for awhile the docs thought was lupus then fibro); I also have diabetes type II and PCOS which causes insulin resistance which doesn't help the diabetes; the weight gain; or any of it. Doc thinks with diabetic meds; the weight will start to come off now. Am on Metformin; and once the doc can code my medical condition right so my healthplan will cover it; I will also be on Byeta which is another diabetic drug which helps weight loss. She will not prescribe any diet drugs; and has told me to stick to the diabetic diet; and that weight loss will be slow. I'm 220 pounds! I just want to cry so badly. I started Lyrica back in the fall for my joint pain problems and gained weight with that. My joints have not hurt as much; and I won't stop the medicine because I need it to function to chase after my 2 year old. I think the weight gain with the Lyrica has stopped; though. So 220 pounds is what I'm staying at. The diabetic stuff was just discovered quite recently. So; how long does it take to lose weight when you're a diabetic? Is South Beach diet or low carb diet safe if I'm on medication that controls my blood sugar levels? And will walking be enough exercise? I thought about buying that Sweating to the Oldies tape; if it's still sold (I remember from when I was a kid they advertised it on TV with Richard Simmons). I can't afford a gym membership; or an excercise bike or treadmill; especially now since I can barely afford all the medication I'm on (there went my husband's raise this year!) and recover from the money I spent between Weight Watchers and LA Weight Loss which did nothing because of my medical conditions. I wish I hadn't spent the money then; because now that I have the diabetic meds; and the doc thinks the dieting will work; now I need them. I guess if I hadn't used them; though; I would be heavier than I am now; so guess have to count my blessings where I can; huh? So; will diabetic diet and dancing to the oldies or whatever excercise tapes I can find that are not too damaging to my joints be enough to lose the weight? And what is a safe weight loss goal? 2 pounds a week? That was what Weight Watchers had said. Is more too much? I was 140 pounds before I got pregnant 3 years ago. And now 220. That's 80 pounds heavier! And most of that was put on when I was pregnant. *sigh* Just feel not myself. I hate pictures taken of me nowadays. I feel like I've aged 10 years. Does anyone else feel like that too? And how do you stay motivated when nothing has worked in the past two years?,2007,2008,107,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I was diagnosed December 2014 Gloucose was 203 . I was put on invonkana (300 mg) plus I changed eating habits and lost 42 lbs. By June fasting blood sugar was 108. Dr said I could probably come off the meds soon if I keep doing this well . Just went to dr 2 weeks ago and fasting sugar was 135. He changed my meds to xigduo xr. Is a change like this normal ? I wasn't testing my own sugar but now I am ( dr told me not to test cause i will obsess which I kind of am) he told me as long as sugar is between 100 & 150. I'm doing well . Online I read as long as sugar stays below 189 after eating ; that's good . Not sure what my numbers should be . Fasting sugar is usually 120. I didn't start the new meds cause I'm worried about side effects and am trying to control this with the invikAna and diet and exercise . Maybe I should try the new meds. Has anyone ever used this med? Are my numbers too high ?,2015,2015,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I wonder if anyone can answer a few questions. Me and my partner have been trying to conceive for around 4months now with still no sign of pregnancy - both been stressed out by this! Even though its early days yet I can't help but feel a huge disappointment when my period Arrives. I recently came across a page explaining that the medication Metformin that is prescribed to people with pcos or diabetes can actually help when trying to conceive; firstly is this correct? I am a 20year old diabetic myself and was prescribed with Metformin around about 9years ago; being a stubborn; foolish teenager I stopped taking my medication about 5years ago and tried to ignore my illness. Since then I have tried to restart my medication myself on a few ocassions but it always results in me being bedridden from feeling so unwell. I have recently seen my gp who is now in the process of helping me deal with and help me to control my diabetes. If I am prescribed with Metformin as before would this increase my chances of conceiving? And could this be why I have caught pregnant already? Any advice or answers please.,2012,2012,19,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I thought this was interesting especially because magnesium was I believe often low in those with cirrhosis also. Magnesium is also cheap which I always appreciate. I don't think I have heard any downside to supplementing magnesium by the label instructions but maybe someone else knows something I don't. I have given it to Joe on and off. Maybe we should stay on? Magnesium Needed to Help Correct Insulin Resistance Monday; October 25; 2010 - Byron Richards; CCN Health Newsletter Details Magnesium deficiency is pervasive in America. And so is type 2 diabetes. I recently reported on this in an article titled Magnesium Intake Linked to Diabetes Risk. Several more studies add further emphasis to the importance of magnesium in maintaining proper blood sugar health. The first study evaluated magnesium levels in men and women ages 60 – 90 with the metabolic syndrome. Those with metabolic syndrome had lower magnesium levels than those not having the problem.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I've been having recurring rashes on my body on various places (from past 3-4 months); mostly on my butt; a patch here and there on my thigh; inside of my thigh; etc. I've been to my general physician and a dermatologist both who diagnosed it as a fungal infection and gave me some meds (latest of which was Griseofulvin 250 mg; thrice daily; course completed about 20 days ago). Every Time it was the same; while I'm taking medications; I have no itch nor any rashes; as soon as those medications stop; within a week; I start to itch and then the rashes appear. The itch is not extreme as in I don't have to itch all the time but it's difficult at times I do have to. I have uploaded all pics to my profile page. Kindly help me on getting a cure for this. I do have newly diagnosed Pre-Diabetes but my blood sugar is very normal; never goes beyond 120. Current Medications; Metformin 500 mg XR Olmesartan Medoxomil 20 mg (for Hypertension; BP is also normal) Other details; 24; Male; Trying to lose weight; 5' 10"; 100 kg (224 lbs); Sedentary lifestyle,2015,2015,24,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Just found this forum and wanted to say "Hi" and introduce myself. I am a 28 year old male with type 1 diabetes. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago on 9/11/03. What a day to pick huh? My father died from complications of diabetes when he was 27. He was type 1 since childhood. I was only 6 weeks old at the time. Obviously I was quite scared when I learned I had it. I was also a little shocked to learn I had diabetes at my age. I have since learned that age really has nothing to do with type 1. I am happy to say that I am now living quite happily with my condition. I don't even think of myself as even having a disease; I'm just a little different. I am currently taking Humulog with each meal and Lantus at bedtime. My A1c's are averaging about 5.2 and my average blood sugar is about 110!!! I do miss some foods but my diet is pretty flexible. My exercise routine is fun and I really enjoy the people I work out with. I have been training mixed martial arts for about two years now. I have also been competetively competing in sport submission grappling. I am a two time silver medalist in the Southwest Submission Grappling Challenge. I am also an avid disc golfer. It's a lot of fun and great exercise too. How many times can you say you walked 4 miles and had fun doing it? Well; there's a little about me. I'd love to hear from you guys and get to know you. I only know one other person with type 1.,2004,2004,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My new doctor changed my prescriptions from regular Met to Met XR and added 2mg of Glimepiride. My BG's have been above 300 for last few months and nothing seems to get them down. Doc thinks this change should do it. I've only taken it twice now but since taking it I've been dizzy. Quite enough I need to lay down. I know it says this may be a side affect but does it go away? It brought my BG's down as I said from over 300 3 hrs after eating to 180 just now. So it is coming down already. Not sure if I can handle this dizziness though. Hope it goes away. Anyone else have this issue and if so; how long did it go and were you able to do anything to lessen the dizziness? Thanks.,2009,2012,50,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have recieved my results from the bloodwork done due to repeated miscarriages (3 in 1 year). All results came back normal except for my hormone levels which are slightly raised (eg testosterone). Gyno has said that he is diagosing it as pcos. He has told me to take 100mg of asprin per day (I dont have a clotting disease) and has said that next time I get pregnant to go straight there and he will put me on hormones;I asked if progesterone was one of them and he said yes. I thought pcos had problems ovulating and getting pregnant; I dont have problems getting pregnant I have problems maintaining pregnancy after 6 weeks.Does anyone know if there is a posibnliity that by taking hormones this will stop me miscarrying. He sid I only have mild pcos; but I am very confused and scared. Has anyone else had these results; I though you had to go on hormones before you get pregnant not when you find out you are pregnant. Could someone please explain any of this too me. Thankyou so much for your time and advice,2005,2005,,

Cardiolite treadmill stress test: revealed Left ventricle conduction delay and possible old lateral wall MI; Spect at rest revealeved moderate anterpostal perfusion defect; after exercise a moderate anterpostal and fairly large apical perfusion defect. Wall motion revealed hypokenetic apex and dyskinetic septum; evidence of mydocardial ischemia involving the anterpostal and apical segments. EF 50-55%. Chest x-ray clear but the Doc told me I have Trace Pulmonary Edemea. High Blood pressure that we have struggled to control for about 5 years. Heart Cath~ 60% Stenosis of mid right coronary artery; essentially normal left main left anterior desending; intermediate and left cicumflex. normal left ventricle enlargement; anteroapical hypokenesia with normal ef 50-55% and left ventricle end distolic pressure of 18 mmhg.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,On 8/13/08 I had to get my Testosterone levels checked to start an acne medication and my Free Testosterone was elevated at 2.13 (normal range 0.10-1.50); but my Testosterone was fine at 54 (normal range 14-76). Due to some concern over these results my physician decided to recheck them on 9/25/08 and again my Free Testosterone was high at 3.14 and my Testosterone was also elevated at 79. During my research about high Testosterone in woman PCOS is something that came up more often than anything else. If you could please help me with any information available I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much!,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,HI ALL SO I am reading some info; seems there are different types of PCOS; which may explain why we are all so darn different!!! So ANYONE with any idea what any of these words means; WHICH AM I? I am trying to work out whether I want to go natural or whether I should do as my Gynea says and stick to BC... I have read with some types this is the worst thing; others - the best... SO SICK of confusing info! (VENT!!!) ... anyway any help on the below would be lovely; my symptoms are... - Normal weight (size 8-10 (max)) 53kgs 165cm tall... (SO normal) - Irregular/no periods - mens' pains all the time/generally dull aches and discomfort (when off pill) - Depression/Anxiety (I get the feeling some people think this is a cop-out)? - Tiredness - Hormones are all normal (except prolactin VERY slightly elivated) meaning all my hormone levels are normal - Policystic Ovaries (none/very irregular ovulation?) I dont like BC pill; and I dont see the point in taking it if a) my hormones are FINE and b) I am not ovulating anyway... so I dont know how I can treat this unless I can work out which type I have? I want to think about children in about a year - so my doc says BC till then; but from what I read it can make it worse in some types (like mine wouldnt be conventional) as all my hormones are fine and I am not overweight or underweight. traditional PCOS -- anovulatory; increased androgens; no insulin resistance endocrine syndrome X -- anovulatory; increased androgens; insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes non-traditional PCOS --anovulatory; normal androgens; obese; insulin resistant or type 2 diabetes non-traditional PCOS -- ovulatory; increased androgens; mild insulin resistance idiopathic hirsutism -- ovulatory; increased androgens; no insulin resistance THANK YOU - hopefully someone can shed some light; I am going to be taking this to my next app to battle it out with them (the fight for natural therapy)... x,2009,2009,22,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; My dad is type 2 and has been having trouble when eating. He will eat very few complex carbs; but when he does; his blood sugar spikes. He exercises almost everyday; but is still not losing any weight. He knows about complex vs simple carbs; but even a very small amount of carbs will send his sugars skyrocketing. The endo and gp doctors just tell him; "you have type 2; exercise more". He is not making any progress even with a strict diet and exercise plan. What else could be happening? Should he be checked for a metabolic disorder? I want something to check on so that he can discuss it with his doctors. I hear other type 2s can eat a standard 30-40 carbs per meal and not have a huge spike. He eats 15 carbs and it shoots up to 200. Any thoughts?,2011,2015,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 46 year old female; currently 70 pounds overweight. I have lost 27 pounds in the past 11 months. I had Gestational Diabetes with my last pregnancy and I have tested my fasting blood sugar once or twice a month for the past 8 years; with the results always between 85 and 99. In November; I noticed I was getting the occasional fasting glucose in the 101 to 103 range. By January; they were all in that range. Three weeks ago I started on the South Beach Diet. Phase 1 restricts carbs to a very low level. I have also started exercising on an elliptical trainer 20 minutes; 4 times per week for the past 2 weeks. I know I am eating enough because my weight loss has been very slow -- between 1 and 1.5 pounds per week. To my surprise; my fasting numbers have INCREASED dramatically. My fasting numbers for the past three weeks have been between 111 and 157! Two hours after a meal I have been running between 95 and 110. I am so frustrated! I have lost the "magic" 10% of my body weight (more like 12%) and I am eating nothing but low-glycemic vegetables and low fat protein. Why are my fasting numbers out of control and why are my after meal numbers so great?,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have type II diabetes and am on medication for it in the highest dose I can take without going to insulin. My highest blood sugar rates are when I wake up in the mornings.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,So my battle begins next Monday...yippi. But had another question for my fellow warriors. Are any of my current suppliments/drugs "not good companions" with SOC and when should I take them if I am taking the riba at breakfast and dinner? I am 2b; Stage 2ish; 3 mil VL; Severe RA; Ostio; TMJ; Scoliosis; IBS; PVC; Migrains etc. I take Enbrel injections 2 shots per week. The Biogenetic TNF blocker for Rheumatoid Arthritis And the following in the AM Prednisone 5-7 mg for RA pain and inflamation Sulindac - anti-inflamitory 1/2 tab Prilosec - for IBS Protien drink - with probiotics and oatmeal with flax seed every morning Calcium - magnesium - RA Centrum Silver 1/2 tab Stress Tab 1/2 tab - energy Vit C 500 - antiox Biotin 1000 - hair/skin Q-10 for migrans/heart Mid day - when lots of pain - Darvacette or more prednisone PM - with dinner - Hylaronic Acid - joints PM - later to sleep - Zoloft - only 25 mgs plus 1/2 xanax or full lorazipam If night pain and can't sleep by 1 am then Soma So my doc just said to keep the steroid under 10mg and everything else was OK - he didn't indicate whether to take with the riba or not. I'm pretty serious about doing this just once so load on the advice please...I understand it is mostly opinion but hey you've been there done that and I have not. Thanks for being patient with me...Lady you were right about all the worry ahead of tx out weighing the symptoms lol mikkimoe,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all. I'm a 56 year old female and I was diagnosed a few months ago with type II. Not too bad. AC1 of 6.4. Doc says if I lose weight and change lifestyle I can probably be diabetes free. Lost 17 lbs. Last AC1 was still 6.3. Was cheating a lot with candy and sugary stuff. So he put me on Metformin 500mg 2x a day. I have to say that taking that did make me feel a lot better. He did not tell me to monitor my blood sugar; but local supermarket was giving out free meters so I got one (tru2go) and some test strips and have been checking here and there; especially when I feel like I'm having a low blood sugar attack. I have never yet had a high reading when I checked at any time. However; I have been having a lot of low blood sugar attacks and readings. In morning around 60; and today felt like I was having an attack even an hour after eating a bowl of unsweetened oatmeal with a banana in it and a bit of fat free milk. I checked and got a reading of 84. My problem is that I suddenly have no income and cannot be going to the DR. regularly. My estranged hubby is ill and had to stop working his full time job (resigned) and isn't making enough to continue to support us (still have kids at home). This happened suddenly. I have been unemployed for a couple of years (due mostly to kid's medical problems) Even my 19 year old can't find a job as yet. We live in a rural area. I go to a local clinic but can no longer pay. And they only had an internist; no nutritionist; or any other specialist to teach me how to manage this. I am waiting on the local Health Dept. to ok my eligibility there and will have access to specialists there. My general diet is high in carbs as I can't afford to buy enough protein foods to lower the carbs and increase the protein with the food stamps I've just been allotted. So I get hungry a LOT cause high carbs are not filling. I get sugar cravings as a result and then eat candy at night. Yes; I know I shouldn't; but those cravings are really hard to fight; not to mention the lifelong habit of high carb snacking at night. I will continue to work on stopping that. But in the meantime; can you tell me if eating some candy the night before can cause my blood sugar to go down so low that even after getting up the next morning and eating that bowl of unsweetened oatmeal and a banana with a little milk; it could still be as low as 84 1 hour after eating? Just from the candy I ate last night? I ate a handful of M&Ms to quickly bring it up; but am still shaking and light headed 15 minutes later. Thanks for any input.,2011,2011,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic 7 years ago at the age of 63. I was pescribes a short acting insulin with meals and and 46 units of a long acting insulin each morning because I could not tolerate metformin. I have been well-controlled with my "normal" fasting glucose ranging between 6 and 8 mmol/l (108 and 144 mg/dl). About 9 months ago I woke up one morning with a reading of 4.7 (84.6) and in subsequent days the lower readings continued. Over a period of about 6 weeks I stopped taking the short-acting insulin at meals and since then I have been reducing the long acting--at present I am taking 34 units--but the low morning readings continue. I have to take meds (for another condition) at midnight so I usually take a glucose reading at that time and those readings are also trending low. Eating a carbish snack at that time seems to exacerbate the low; driving it even lower. In the past few days I have noticed that when my glucose is below 6 I have dry mouth; like my mouth is lined with cotton fluff. I tested about an hour ago and I was 5.7 (102.6). Yesterday morning I was 4.7 (84.6) and the dry mouth. I take a diuretic-type blood pressure med due to a tendency to accumulate fluid around my ankles but I have been taking it for a year and a half so I doubt it is related to this. Can hypoglycaemia cause dry; cottony mouth and thirst? Or should I be looking for other causes? My diabetes specialist is baffled and has me titrating the long-acting down; 2 unit reduction at a time; trying to find a number that stabilizes my levels. So far no luck. Any ideas or suggestions?,2018,2018,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Yikes; this is harder than I thought it would be. I've had diabeties for over 20 yrs; most of the time poorly controlled (don't yell at me - didn't know it until I'd had it by Dr's estimate for over 10 yrs and dmg was done - and to top that off I didn't have insurance when I did find out; so little control / supervision). To make a long story short; I'm having major health issues now. They say the devil is in the details; but honestly I don't want to post it all. The problem I am currently trying to deal with is muscle tremors / spasms. They are cyclic; I get them everywhere. They don' t hurt when they happen; its like a little energy pulse going through my muscles and causing them to jerk or twitch. They are madly unpredictable; though when they are happening they do seem to occur more when I lay down to rest. The problem .... sometimes they happen so frequently and for so long (hours) - it causes my muscles to tighten up then cramp. Now my leg muscles are almost constantly knotted. The muscles around my stomach are starting to do the same thing. The knotted and cramping is VERY painful. Here is my question. Do others with diabetic neuropathy have similar problems? My doctor swears the diabeties is the cause - but I'd never heard of it before. I'm kind of hoping it is something else - something they can help me manage or even stop the tremors (which are cyclic and stop on their own for several days / weeks / months at a time then restart with a vengance. So .. anyone else with diabetic neuroapathy have tremor / spasms? Thanks in advance for reading and any reply!,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 50 year old female who was diagnosed with very mild Crohn's disease at age 38. Thankfully I have long periods of remission. I also have type 2 diabetes treated with metformin; diet; and exercise. In May of 2004 I started to notice an unusual discharge with my stool. I've noticed a pale yellow cylindrical object about one to one and a half inches long; the girth like that of an average woman's middle finger. The outside is tough and resist pressure; but the inside is bright white and very soft. There's usually more than one of these foreign bodies; and they typically are not imbedded in fecal matter. I notice them most when I have diarrhea. They are present; on average; two or three days each month. Previous to this; my Crohn's has affected the last 20cm of my colon; and is evident by blood clots and some white mucous; and severe cramping very low in my abdomen. My last colonoscopy in 2003 was negative. I had problems last summer with severe pain underneath the sternum; lightheadedness; nausea;and loss of appetite. (Very unusual for me - I'm obese; not much can keep me from food!) A HIDA scan of the gallbladder; barium x-ray of the upper GI and small bowel; and a stress test/cardiac ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. Every three months I have blood drawn to check cholesteral levels (all three); kidney and liver function; as well as A1C levels; as part of my diabetes monitoring. Other than slightly elevated cholesteral and an A1C level of 7.3; everything else is normal. I'm scheduled for a colonoscopy in July 2005. I'm stymied as to what this discharge is; it's cause; and if it could be related to Crohn's disease. As stange as it sounds; I have photographed these objects to take to my doctor this summer. I'm perplexed; curious; and a bit worried. Any help you can give me would be much appreciated. For you time and consideration in this matter I offer my sincere thanks.,2005,2005,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dr. Schiano; Hi there! I'm thankful for this site to get a insight into understanding medical diagnoses. Before I get started; I would like to thank you for all you do and taking the time in reviewing my post. Well; I'll start with telling you a little about my health. I've type 2 diabetes; high cholesterol; high trig. (hereditary on mother's side). I was just diagnosed with Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Due to the diabetes and high cholesterol I was taking metformin 500 mg.'s once a day and lipitor 10 mg.'s once a day for about 6 yrs. now. I've now been taken off the medicine's now due to high liver enzymes. I was diagnosed with a fatty liver in 2008. I feel like I'm falling apart; the unknown is the worse. Anyhow; I just had a ultrasound done on my liver; pancreas; aorta and right kidney due to high liver enzymes. I had a attack about 4 yrs. ago with pain under my left breast that radiated around my left side in my back and shoulder area. Never did find out why. However; since that attack; I've to take beano before eating veggies and gas-x at times; or I've a discomfort. Unfortunately; I never did receive a diagnose as to what happened. Ok; so now; I will list my high liver enzymes: 3/24/12- Alanine Aminotransferase 59 U/L High 0-55 7/5/12-Aspartate Aminotransferase 57 U/L High 5-34 7/5/12-Alanine Aminotransferase 100 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/11/12-Aspartate 60 U/L High 5-34 Aminotransferase Alanine Aminotransferase 114 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/19/2012-Aspartate Aminotransferase 56 U/L High 5-34 Alanine Aminotransferase 118 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 Ok; so I'm told it's probably from the generic of lipitor; per the pharmacist the generic has the same ingredients as lipitor. She doesn't agree. Anyhow; I'm thinking the same because I've been off the lipitor since 7/6/12; and my enzymes are still climbing expect -Aspartate Aminotransferase did drop a little still not in normal range. Could the cause of my liver enzymes be because of the Hashi's? if so; is it dangerous to have high liver enzymes for a long period of time? I'm scheduled to see a gastro & Endocrinologist in Oct. but am afraid if something serious; it could be to late. Again; I'm greatly appreciated in all you do,2012,2012,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have had hashimoto's thyroiditis for over 10 yrs. Recently my tests have shown that I need more medication as they are at the bottom of the range. I have gained wt. but exercise and eat low carb. diet. I have been monitoring my glucose levels with a home meter which shows a.m fasting in the low 100's. My question is; with my thyroid hormones being too low; would that make my glucose numbers too high. I seem to be in the pre diabetes stage. I will see my Dr. next week. Should I wait and get my thyroid to normal levels before taking Metformin. This discussion is related to sudden onset of type 2 diabetes.,2007,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My blood glucose test 10/4/11 was 289. The doctor then ordered an A1c test; the result was 11.5. After seeing the results of my blood glucose test; and especially in the past week after buying a blood glucose monitor and seeing just how bad my blood sugar was; I'd been eating very lightly to avoid an emergency from very high blood sugar. Consequently I've lost eight pounds I saw my doctor for the first time yesterday since having diabetic symptoms and was diagnosed with diabetes. (Surprise! LOL) She said she wanted to start meds slowly; so put me on 500mg metformin and 100mg Januvia and gave me an 1800 calorie diet. And she told me that if my blood sugar should end up over 400 and I was feeling really bad; to go to the emergency room. The idea was that she would gradually increase my metformin; but wouldn't do that until my next appointment in two weeks. She also chided me for taking so many blood tests; saying to only take them at bedtime and before meals for now. I took my meds after dinner last night as directed; but forgot to take my BS before bedtime as I typically go to bed shortly after eating dinner. But by the time I took my BS at 3:30 AM before my middle-of-the-night "snack;" it was down to 297. And my before-breakfast reading at 10:00 AM was 291. These were readings similar or slightly better than I'd been getting shortly before seeing the doctor but I'd now been eating more food; so while that was far from being under control; at least we were heading in the right direction. But then I ate breakfast. The meal plan called for 2 starches; 1 meat; 2 fruit; 1 milk and 1 fat serving. Most of the foods I ate were the same foods as listed as a menu example; though I did substitute an extra meat serving (some ham in my scrambled egg) for a starch serving (example was 1/2 cup cream of wheat). I ended up feeling rather poorly after breakfast; but certainly not so poorly I thought I should go to an emergency room. I did lie down for a few minutes to rest; but I was able to go back to normal activities (even got down on hands and knees to scrub a floor) and by lunch time was feeling pretty normal again. But then I took by BS before lunch about 2:00 PM. 548! That would have been about 3.5 hours since finishing breakfast. There was no way with a BS like that that I dared to eat the prescribed lunch of 2 starches; 2 meats; 1 vegetable; 1 fruit; and 2 fats! I ended up having a marinated bean salad over a mostly green salad which I'd interpret as 1 starch; 1 meat; 1 vegetable and 1.5 fat servings. And I'm skipping the afternoon snack of 1 starch and 1 fruit (for which the example was 6 vanilla wafers and 1 small banana. I'd be in the hospital!) My doctor isn't in on Fridays; so I couldn't call her and ask anything. So what would you do? Follow the diet and resign myself that I'll end up going to the hospital to let them sort it out? Go back to my former low-calorie diet at which I was losing weight until I can get an appointment with an endocrinologist? I have no idea how long that would take. (I'm currently at 120 pounds; what I consider the low end of my ideal weight range.) Follow my gut on diet until I go back and see my doctor in two weeks and ask to be put on insulin? Other? And how bad do I have to feel before it warrants going to emergency? Some people go to emergency at the drop of a hat; but with high blood sugar; what is true emergency? What would be the symptoms - besides just a bad reading. (And incidentally; I haven't yet had my monitor checked for accuracy; though presumably most of them are now pretty good. My doctor said to wait until my next blood test in about a month.),2006,2011,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband had a quad bypass 12/98 at age 63. He was obese and a heavy smoker. Since then he has quit smoking; but is still 20 lbs overweight. He has type 2 Diabetes. May 24; 2005; he had a heart cath done due to continuing mild chest pain. It showed blocked in one of the "branches" off a new artery. Decided to stent next day; but the blockage was GONE. Dr. says maybe "spasms". Put on nitropatch for one week; then removed and treating with nitroquick as needed for 2 weeks. BP has been running low; under 102/60 most days. BP meds are lopressr 25 mg and vasotec 2.5; one in a.m. other p.m. Thus feels exhausted most of the time. Other meds: metformin; lexapro; wellbutrin sr; simvistatin. synthroid; low dose aspirin. The pain usually occurs while sitting/reclining; though sometimes on morning walk of less than 1 mile. Your website indicates no cure for this.....(?)and his cardiol. says nothing to prevent it......something patient just has to live with..... ARe there other ways to treat this condition? Does it warrant a second opinion or is it fairly common for male age 70? Thank you for help.,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Last year I was told that I had hypoglycemia because my sugar levels would sink low. I was also told that this was probably what causes me to get waves of lightheadedness. I started keeping oranges and juice around and it seemed to help some. My GLU-RD # (new range 60-99) has been crawling up from 101;103 107 and now 109 My GLycohemoglobin *Hemoglobin A1C # (range 4.0-6.0) was 5.8 and now is 6.0 No biggy right? My 12 fasting Tolerance testing says GLU-FST (60-99 MG/DL range) is 109 GlU-1HR (58-160 MG/DL range) is 231 GLU-2HR (70-125 MG/DL range) is 236 She has on the sheet...Diabetes! I eat very healthy and usually never put sugar in anything. How could I be hypoglycemic and have diabetes too. She asked me about starting pills; but I don't really think I need them unless I drink a massive sugar drink that makes me dizzy and want to puke. LOL Or am I just that ignorant to this? I already take Lopressor; and Diazide/Maxide for high blood pressure and edema; Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism; Lipitor for high hs CRP and cholesterol and low dose aspirin for heart issues. I really hate to add another life long pill to this list. I would greatly appreciate any comments.,2008,2009,41,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,i have been doing a good job keeping my diabetes under control. But my last A1C jumped from 6.1 to 6.6. My doctor has put me on victoza; but after using it for a month i have read about some serious side effect issues.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am also having trouble with low blood sugar. My blood sugar goes from 44 to 255. I know normal is 80-120 . At the Diabetes clinic they said if mine dropped from 50-70 to take gluclose tabs; 8; but my body is reacting like a normal one. I take 4 at 44 which is life threatening low. I also notice that lately it's dropping after I eat which I don't understand. This discussion is related to Blood sugar drops after eating.,2009,2009,55,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a female; 60 years old; with type II diabetes; taking 1000mg of metformin daily and have been exercising regularly for well over two years. My glucose is well under control (I thought); with A1C readings between 5 and 5.5 for the last two years. Recently I had reason to wonder about my glucose levels after exercising. I exercise twice a day; early in the AM before work and after work. I usually do a 45 minute routine on the treadmill or a combination of treadmill; bike or resistance. I have found over the last several weeks that my glucose levels rise after exercise in the AM (I workout before eating); usually as much as 30-40 points (from 103 to 145 for instance). In the afternoon; my glucose levels usually fall between 20 - 25 points. Any ideas about what's going on? I do have an appointment with my doc in a couple of weeks and will talk with him; too; but I thought I'd try you out. Thanks!,2004,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was in Urgent Care two weeks ago with what I thought was a ectopic pregnancy. Turned out to be a Hemmorhagic ovarian cyst. The cyst ruptured 5 days ago. The pain has been getting me down but my OB has assured me it will get better. In the process of this I have been told that I may have one of the following diseases. Polycystic Ovarian Disease or Lutean Phase Defect. To make matters worse; my husband and I are trying for a baby. I guess my body does not allow me to get pregnant or stay pregnant. Im now on Metformin which is a diabetic drug that helps with fetility problems. The side effects are getting me down even more. If this does not help get me pregnant in three months; I will then go on another fertility drug that has a high risk of multiples. Im 24 years old and Im overwhelmed with this hitting me all at once. Im excited and scared. I will also need to take progesterone shots during my pregnancy. My husband and I are blessed with a 4 year old. I guess Im just looking for support from people in simular situations. I had no problems getting pregnant with our Daughter. If anyone has any advice; I would love to hear it. Thank you.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Ok I didn't know what forum to post this question in so I'm trying here because it is a Insulin problem. So Ok my insulin levels are 570 but my fasting glucose is perfectly normal. I've had this problem for quite some time now. When it was first found my levels were 130 thee doctors put me on the Metiformin for 2 years to level it out. When my insulin leveled off they diagnosed me with hypothyroidism apparently I have had it for years but the high insulin levels were masking the high TSH levels. They got that under control and I was fine for years then my insulin levels started rising again they tried to put me on the metiformin again but this time around I had awful side effects. They were so bad they couldn't keep me on the drug. My doctor at the time said if the levels aren't bothering me then I can forgo the meds for the time being. At this time the level was 410. It's been a few more years since then and now my doctor is all paranoid that I have a tumor on my pancreases. I'll admit I'm over weight but I also have hypothyroidism and quit smoking a while back; I rarely consume sugar I don't drink coffee I only put honey or agave in my tea if I have a soda it's diet I don't really drink sugary fruit juices I have my 8 glasses of water a day and I try to follow the Canada food guide to the best of my ability. I do have the odd cupcake or cookie from time to time it's not like a refrain entirely I am human after all but I avoid it as much as I can. I'm booked in to see a specialist but it'll be a few weeks before I get in and I'm getting a little worried 570 is kinda high.,2009,2014,36,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I want to know if my weight is correct for my age and height. (Male; 54; 5ft 5in; 145 pounds; Asian Indian). I'm a marginal diabetic (excellent control with 1/2 tablet of 1 mg metformin at night). I walk 40-60 min every single day (3.5 mph); do 30 min of pranayama and 30 min of yoga asanas on alternate days and 30 min of dumbbell weight training on the other three days. Yet; my weight won't go down. I'm a vegetarian; and am reducing the carb intake a lot; relying mostly on salads and veg smoothies. My dietician says 130 pounds should be my ideal weight; my endocrinologist and cardiologist say that given my age and otherwise what he describes as a healthy condition; 145 is ok. Whom do I believe?,2010,2010,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am not understanding why would the fact that a person is overweight put them at higher risk for diabetes. Lets say we have 2 people A and B. A: 150lbs muscle + 20lbs fat = 170lbs total B: 150lbs muscle + 50lbs fat = 200lbs total Lets say they both eat a meal with the same amount of carbs; the insulin response of the muscle cells is higher than that of the fat cells so they both absorb the same amout of glucose with their 150lbs of muscle each. Now fat cells still help absorbing the glucose even though not as much as muscle. So 'A' absorbs some more glucose with his 20lbs of fat; but 'B' should absorb even more with his 50lbs of fat? So seems like the heavier person would actually absorb more glucose out of their bloodstream? Then why are they at higher risk?,2013,2015,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and along with that comes Insulin Resistance. Lately I have been really thirsty; my feet and fingers go numb; I have weird bruising and am always tired. My fasting glucose was 118. I crave sugar and after I eat sugar I usually get a migraine and my stomach feels like a huge balloon and I feel quite nauseous. I am 22 years old; weigh 197lbs; am 5'6"; I get a good amount of exercise but it is really hard to lose weight with PCOS. I have to go for blood testing for my doctor this week and I am quite concerned that my Insulin Resistance has turned into Type 2 diabetes. I know that none of you are doctors but does it sound like I may have diabetes? Thank you!,2004,2004,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,A little over 2 moths ago; I had a bad slip and fall during some severe winter weather. When I fell; I had struck the back of my head (left side) with loss of conscieness. I had been very confused; disoriented; feeling of neausea; coordination issues; and barely knew my own name. Since the fall; I have experienced facial spasms; bad headaches; left eye pain; memory problems; dizziness; confusion; and neck pain located at the top of my neck. The original doctor that has seen me took an x-ray of the neck and found an abnormality of the C-1 vertabrae; extending forward unnaturally. This prompted the doctor to have me transported to a local trauma center by ambulance. A CT scan was done with no abnormalites. A MRI was later conducted with results stating that everything was esentailly normal. THe noted issues was reversed lordosis of the C-1/C-2 vertabrae; narrowing of the foramina; and disc degenerative disease of C-6/C-7; C-7/T-1. An EEG was conducted; the result was abnormal awake/asleep for partial seziure disorder of the left side of the brain. The side that struck the icy pavement in the accident. I have had physical therapy for my neck pain that is not helping; but actually in some ways making it worse. I have been put on Pamelor first for the headaches. I had even worse dizziness and raised blood sugar levels to excessive levels. Then put on Depakote and could not tolerate that well either. Now I am on Lamictal and not doing to well with this either. In addition; I have been prescribed Vicoden for the headaches on Lamictal. I have never had or ever diagnosed with epilepsy; and only recently diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic (June 2010). I have been told by my Endocrinologist that I am extremely healthy for a Diabetic. He scatches his head at the blood work; because everything is in the levels of a 20 year old athlete; only exception is blood sugar. Here are my main questions for anyone that can help guide me in a positive direction of healing. Before the fall; the only medication that I took was Metformin for Type II Diabetes and was getting ready to come off of of it. Now I am making my local pharmacy very happy and wealthy. The various medications that keep being prescribed that do not work and having to add more diabetes medications to the mix. In addition; I am a couple steps away from being on insulin only. My goal was to get off of the diabetes medication; not stay on it. If I cannot tolerate antidepressant and antiepileptic medications for headaches and given narcotic pain medication. Does this not mean that maybe this is not the issue? Maybe more attentention should be directed at my neck? Physical therapy makes the neck pain worse and not better. This also makes my head and other symptoms worse. Again does this not warrant more investigation? I feel as though I am being ignored and just told to take a medication that makes me feel worse that I already had. If anyone knows of a better path to take to recovery form this injury. I would greatly appreciate the advice.,2011,2011,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 32 years old and have had sensory neuropathy for the last 2 months over my entire body. It began in my feet and rapidly spread throughout my legs; up through my torso and from my shoulders down; then up into my neck. This occurred over a few days. After several trips to my doctor and eventually an internal medicine doctor; then neurologist; no one could figure out a reason. I have type 2 diabetes and was officially diagnosed 4 months ago; but it is in control. The internal med doctor initially suspected Guillain Barre'; but an EMG ruled that out (it was normal). I've had an MRI of my cervical spine and one of my brain. I've had comprehensive blood tests to rule out anything else. I'm on Metformin (for blood sugar) and Avapro (for hypertension). I recently went on these meds; about 2 months before symptoms began. The numbness seems to be a bit worse lately in my right leg and this scares me. The other neurologist I've seen recently says to take a wait-and-see approach since I have no other symptoms. I'm very worried and would like to know what is going on before the numbness spreads any further. I have two toddlers and need to expend my energy with them; not worrying about my health. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm 35 years old- I have 1 child- had a c-sec 2 years ago. During pregnacy developed Gestational Diabetes- still taking meds for hugh blood sugar. Prior to pregnacy had normal menstral cycle. Occasional pain on one side mid cycle. Since giving birth my cycle hasn't been quite as regular- but still fairly consistant. Recently I've gone as long as 40 days between periods. They seem normal; not alot of pain- nothing that 1 motrin can't fix- some clotting but I wouldn't classify as heavy bleeding. My problem is mid way I will have pain on one side. The right side has been worse than the left. The pain can last from a few days to over a week (right side). The pain can be debilitating at times- usually requiring many motrin and even then I am still feeling it. My doctor thinks it's mittersmertz (sorry if I spelled that wrong) When I lay in bed for an extended period of time- such as an 8 hour night of sleep- I have low back pain. I can't determine if that is related though- this is something that is consistant and doesn't vary with my cycle. I have recently started burping a lot-but only at night. I know it sounds crazy that I would worry about something like that- I take Metformin 500 mcg 2 times a day and byetta 10 mcg 2 times a day. Both of these drugs can cause gasto troubles. So- Is this something to really worry about? If this was a cancer type situation would the pain be constant? Incidently- when the pains are very severe- it radiates to the thigh on the side that hurts. Any input would be greatly appreciated. After my c-sec; my doctor didn't seem like there could be any types of issues so I would assume that all was well. I don't how much is looked at during childbirth. When I talked to her about this she didn't seem concerned. I am though- being the mother of a young child- I need to take care of myself. Thanks so much in advance.,2007,2007,,

They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post.

My first miscarriage was when I was 8 weeks; the 2nd was when I was 6 weeks and this one is I am only 3 weeks... the ectopic was really early as well. I have been seeing a doctor to help with my fertility issues.... as I do have PCOS and do not ovulate regularly. This last pregnancy I was on clomid to help ovulation and then we did an IUI... which was successful at getting me pregnant... but I just can't seem to keep being pregnant. It is very frustrating. My first pregnancy was my only successful one.. and I have a wonderful 6 year old... but since then I have not been able to maintain a pregnancy....

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I just received some bizarre test results and wondering if someone can help interpret them. I am an expat living in Indonesia where good healthcare is very hard to find; and my thyroid and estrogen both seem to be plummeting. Iron and B12 also very low/deficient. I am a 28yo female. Symptoms: weight gain; inability to affect fat composition with exercise; hair thinning and loss; hair by hair turning white and crinkly; low body temp (~97.4F); hirsutism (since puberty); acne (especially chin/cheeks); lately hot flashes! Sleep quality has been extremely poor for well over a year now. Wake ups once or twice a night; and if I stay awake past midnight I'll be awake for hours (was always a night owl but these patterns particularly started March 2013). Never feel rested. Last year massive sugar cravings but under control with Metformin. Mother has Hashimoto's. Medications: 2;000mg/day Metformin XR since August 2013 (a doc in US looked at me when I was seeking help for many of these symptoms and said "PCOS". She only tested TSH at that time; which was 1.040 (0.400-5.500)). Also took roaccutane 10mg/day June/July this year for acne. Test results: APRIL 28; 2014 T3: 1.05 ng/mL (0.8-2.0) T4: 6.31 μg/dL (5.10-14.10) TSH: 1.88 μIU/mL (0.27-4.20) FT3: 4.53 pmol/L (3.10-6.80) FT4: 1.09 ng/dL (0.89-1.76) Anti Thyroglobulin AB: 18 IU/mL (Negative: = 115) Thyroglobulin: 38.30 ng/mL (0-55) Anti TPO: 0.20 (AB Index) (1.1: Positive) --- Still not feeling well! More tests! --- AUGUST 5; 2014 Ferritin: Low 15 ng/mL (15 – 150) Vitamin B-12: Low 123 pg/mL (174 – 878) FT3: Low 3.00 pmol/L (3.10 – 6.80 (Adult)) FT4: 1.13 ng/dL (0.89 – 1.76 (Adult)) Estradiol : Low 18.8 pg/mL - Follicular Phase: 39-189 - Mid-Cycle Peak: 94-508 - Luteal Phase: 48-309 - Post-Menopause: 0-41 - Male: 7.6-42.6 Progesterone: 0.19 ng/mL - Follicular phase: 0.2-1.5 - Ovulation phase: 0.8-3.0 - Luteal phase: 1.7-27 - Post-menopause: 0.1-0.8 (This was 5 days after first day of my period; so follicular phase. At least i'm still menstruating??) I went to the doctor that day because of a throat infection which ended up a mean bug. I think my low body temp (usually 97.4) is making me more susceptible to bugs. Also; thyroid ultrasound that day revealed nothing. Actions taken since last year: tried low carb; then not-so-low carb; low GI; on/off gluten free; routinized sleep schedule; exercise (swimming 40 min 4x/week). I eat healthily; mostly food I cook for myself; veggies/chicken/eggs/fruit. I've changed my whole lifestyle and tried everything and this is only getting worse. Do you have any suggestions for what might be wrong here; and what follow up tests I need? I can request any tests I might need. Already guessing TSH for sure; FSH; then ACTH? cortisol (blood test)? Unfortunately I can't get cortisol saliva test here. Should I test my liver function? Ultrasound of my uterus? Pituitary gland? Would very much appreciate if you have any insight or advice. Thank you so much!,2014,2014,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For about 2 - 2 1/2 years now I've had this brownish skin discoloration under my breasts; inner thighs next to pelvic area; small spot under arm and small spots on the back of my neck. The inner thighs and breasts is where it began. It started as small spots like dime size then filled out into large areas. It stays a light brown color and has a faint smell under my breasts. If I get hot and sweaty; sometimes it will get bright red; burn; itch and tingle. When it does this; I clean it with antibacterial soap and it takes away the burning feeling. If I don't shower all day it will itch a little. Sometimes it will get a scaly look but rarely. It's flush with my skin and never raised or inflammed. I've asked 2 doctors about it but neither one have any idea what has caused it and neither did any bloodwork so I'm in the process of finding another doctor. I've read about many different things online and have found several things close enough to possibly be it. I'm just looking for someone elses opinion and possible same experience. I've had dry skin my entire life but it doesn't seem to relate. I have pics but it won't let me attach them from my iphone. Any info is greatly appreciated.,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Just got diagnosed with Type II today; in addition to my other health issues. I'm insulin resistant (had gestational diabetes and found that out when I was pregnant). Funny thing is that I've been taking Lyrica for my fibromyalgia and find out that it was originally used for diabetic nerve pain. Ha ha ha.... well; at least I guess I don't have to worry about that since I'm on Lyrica already. LOL. So; what diets are good for diabetes? I've been tryign to go as all natural and close to organic as I can afford; and my doctor said South Beach diet really good. So I got the book from my motherinlaw today... and a recipe book. How do you stick to a low carb diet? When I was pregnant; I just kept thinking; only so many more weeks and then I won't have to worry about it. After I delivered; my blood sugar levels were normal and I passed the 3 hour glucose test and my 3 month blood levels several months for a followup visit were fine again. But; 2 years later; now have diabetes; and it's for life; not just for a few months. So; how do you get in the right mindset? How do you give up those carbs? And how do you lose the weight!? And what medicines are good? My doc started me on Metformin and wants me to check with my health insurance to see if they will cover Byeta (not sure of spelling on that). Are those good drugs? Do they help with weight issues? Or do they cause weight gain? My father did not do well on Byeta and he blames that medication for messing up his levels; and he says he had to stop Byeta and go on insulin and he had been fine before doing it. So; is Byeta bad? Or is it good? My father is insulin resistant as well; so I think it's a genetic thing. And what things do you buy to keep in your house!? Looking in my closet; reading all the labels; man do we have a high carb household! I nearly dropped dead when I saw the carb count on the bagel package. And to think I was having one of those suckers every morning for breakfast!,2007,2008,107,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,About 5 years ago I had a fist-sized complex cyst removed from my right ovary. They had originally thought it was dermoid based on the scan; but it turned out to be a haemorragic cyst with some additional blood vessel stuff going on. It's possible that it had grown over many years - I'd had irregular bleeding and pain for about 9 years; but never had it taken seriously enough to have a referral to gyn. This cyst was removed keyhole and they took part of the ovary that was damaged but left the rest. They also did a D&C because my uterus lining was overgrown; probably just as a result of so much irregular bleeding. Things never fully 'settled' and after a while the symptoms returned; though initially not as badly. Scan showed at couple of persistent corpus luteum cysts; so it seemed like the process was beginning again. Keen to stop me ovulating; they fitted a Mirena. Total nightmare - I bled and cramped for 12 weeks then expelled the thing in the ER in excruciating pain and severe shock. Shortly after that one of the cysts ruptured; and I spent a few days in hospital in agony with that; so they operated and found that in addition to the ruptured cyst and the remaining blood-filled corpus luteum cyst I also had multiple PCO style cysts; and my ovary was adhered to my bowel and my abdomen wall. So; they did a major clean up. They had previously said that I couldn't possibly have PCO cysts and functional cysts; so that was a surprise. That was over 3 years ago. Life since then has been way easier. Normal periods with normal period pain; roughly on schedule and without random bleeding in between! Then about 4 months ago I started to get a bit of spotting between ovulation and my period. My periods have been getting longer and more painful; and I've had many more hormonal symptoms - breast pain and a linea negra. Now I have - for approx 4 weeks - on-off pain in my right lower abdomen. The pain seems to originate about half way across that side; just an inch or so above my groin. Hurts to touch; pain is worse with activity; and radiates right down into the groin / thigh and into my pelvis on that side. Occasionally I'm having more period-y type cramping as well. The pain in my side is occasionally really sharp; but often feels like a weird burning sensation; almost like an itch. I've been referred for a ultrasound and gyn follow up - I've moved house since my last problems so there's no fast track. I will likely wait 12 weeks for the appointment; if I'm lucky. I can live with this at the moment; but I can't stand the thought of it getting as bad as it was before. I won't know until I see the gyn whether they are the 'wait and see' type. I kind of want to know how to approach the doctor at the first visit. I saw half a dozen different gyns through my previous treatment - it was a teaching hospital - and they all had totally different opinions. The final one who operated on me was female and said she had no idea how I had been functioning (I barely was by the end) and that I should have been fast-tracked into surgery much sooner. I've learned that the decisions made about your treatment are often a bit arbitrary; and taking a position yourself is not a bad idea. I've done waiting and seeing before; and it hasn't worked out! Does anyone have experience of recurring cysts which have become less problematic? Have you done 'wait and see' and had it resolve untreated? I don't relish the idea of another surgery; but if it's going to be needed I'd rather not go through several months of escalating pain first.,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Because I was very unsatisfied with the Dr. I saw 2 weeks ago who did 2 hypo tests (TSH and T4); said I was withing "normal range" and get me some Metformin to help with weight loss (haven't lost anything yet btw); I went to see another Dr. a friend referred me to on Tuesday. He was so much more detailed with me! I brought a list of symptoms with me just to ensure I wouldn't forget anything! He not only told me that I do have alot of the symptoms for Hypo but also Growth Hormone Deficiency (I'm not a very tall person; about 5'4")! That other doctor never even mentioned it (and I think she just gave me the drug for the weight loss and perhaps she thought that was my ONLY reason for seeing her. It wasn't at all. She never even touched on the other symptoms; just the weight gain). Anyways; this is what he tested on Tuesday: Hemoglobin A1C Somalomedin T-3 Free T-4 Free TSH Thyroid Peroxidase Antibiodies This will help with results for "regular" tyroid problems; also Hasimoto's and GHDeficiency Today I spent 2 1/2 hours here having a ACTH Stimulation Test. That was fun. Ugh. Blood drawn for a baseline; an injection into my hand and 3 other draws every half hour. I also have to do a 5 hr Glucose test in July as well. I should have the first results back tomorrow. Today's next week. He was VERY attentive and listened to me and acknowledges that something is in fact wrong with me and he WILL one by one determine what it is not! My arms and hand look like I'm a drug addict at the moment and hurt like hell; but I know in the end; it will all be worth it!,2012,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am a 29 year old female ; 300 lbs; high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. It took a lot for me just to actually openly say that in a forum like this. but here goes I have been on a path towards better health; I went pretty much my whole life never taking my health into consideration and now that I have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure reality has set in and made me realize that I am not longer able to be in denial that I have a problem. I knew that I wasnt headed in the right direction all these years; but I had little to no self control. Food just always seemed more understanding then anything; and I cant believe how out of control I allowed myself to get. But I am a mother of an 8 year old and its time I start setting a better example for her. So I am currently trying to gain more education about nutrition and these two awful diseases i have at such a young age. I thought I would mention that before I go on about my question. So back in October I had started taking metformin twice a day 500 mg ... but i wasnt very consistent with it; i barely took it because of the side effects as far as going to the bathroom like crazy. and I was also put on 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for my bp; to see if a water pill could help reduce it before I had started an actual medication. but again with that i wasnt consistent because I always felt really awful cramps in my legs i was also put on an oral contraceptive called alesse because i was also diagnosed with a cyst on my right ovary; so my ob wanted to see if the pill would help shrink it(this med i was taking as prescribed) but in december i started taking my water pill and metformin medication religiously as prescribed and i later had to receive iron infusions because i started to get severly anemic; and in january my potassium levels were very low; causing my fingers and toes to always cramp and stick together; it was weird; I also started to feel extreme faint feelings i was driving and nearly fainted behind the wheel and had to go to emergency where the dr just said that i had vertigo and needed to follow up with my doctor. i wasnt convinced it was vertigo because i had it before when i was 25 and the room did not feel like it was spinning i felt like i was going to collapse at any moment. in january i was put on potassium pills; and given a bp medication amlodipine. which helped lower my bp from the 180/90 range to the 149/90 range. and the ob discontinued the birth controls saying it was contributing to my high bp. and one night while driving in january i nearly fainted behind the wheel again this time with my daughter in the car! i go to emergency and they kept me over night to monitor my heart they did some contrast test to see if i was having a pulmonary embolism because i felt pressure in my chest as well. I also went for a ct scan and chest xray along with a 24 hour blood pressure/heart eko. and they also did a stress test where they injected me with something that would make my heart race and all tests came back normal; potassium levels were back up. my doctor just took me off water pill amlodopine and metformin. i am now just taking lisinopril and .25 mg of xanax as needed because i am not sure if those feelings are anxiety related or something else. the other day at work from the moment i woke up i felt dizzy; off balance and weak; i went to work my eyes started to blur and i felt the fainting feeling coming on again was brought to emergency all blood tests were normal; i dont know what to do anymore its interfering with driving; work; and im afraid. my doctor is ordering a vitamin d test for monday and some more fasting labs. when i got to the er my sugar levels were normal my blood pressure was elevated to 156/90 but later back down to 130/70 laying down and sitting up and 127/70 standing. oxygen levels clear... my question is what else could i suggest looking into? i am always staying hydrated,2015,2015,29,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I was diagnosed with diabetes in late May of this year. I am slim build and 34 years old and I was originally thought to be type 1 however my GAD results were negative and as I only require about 6 units of slow acting insulin (insulartard) a day my health care team now think I am type 2. My problem is with extreme tiredness. Since a few days after diagnosis I have been suffering with extreme tiredness which has been getting worse and now I can't even work. I was tired in the months (and years) before diagnosis however this feels very different. It is like my gas tank is empty and I feel wiped out often after only a few chores or similar. My blood glucose levels are relatively stable and within limits. My doctor has run tests for thyroid and anemia plus others and they have come back as negative. She now says that there are no other tests she can run. My diabetes team say they can't help as my blood glucose levels are normal. At diagnosis my A1C was 12.8% and although my diet had been moderately healthy it was very carb heavy; possibly about 70% of more of my diet.. Now my carb intake is much lower at about 30%. Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing my tiredness? I would be very grateful for any suggestions I could investigate. best wishes Rich,2009,2009,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Good Morning; all...I went to the dr. on Tuesday so he could give me the results of my blood work and u/s I had done last week. He said by looking at my b.w.; he does not think I've ovulated (last AF was 8/11) and my u/s showed no signs of cysts & everything looks to be normal. But he thinks I may have cysts inside of my ovaries; which could be the cause of the pain I've been experiencing on my left side. So his conclusion is that I either have PCOS or endometriosis. For now he is calling it PCOS because in order for him to diagnose me w/ endo.; he would have to do surgery. The next step for us to take is when I start my period; he is going to put me on clomid to hopefully make me "o". My cycles were lasting 48 days; but today is cd 49 and still no sign of AF. He didn't give me any info. on PCOS; or any meds so I was wondering for those of you who have PCOS; does this sound like that's what it is; and what experiences have you had w/ it? Thanks!!!!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am a 23 yrs of age and have recently become aware of an ovarian cyst. I developed a 1 in. lump in the right lower pelvic reg. in March. Since than I have had 2 ultra sound exams that were approx. 3-4 monthes apart both showing the size to be 1 in. and unchanged. I have been put on 2 months of birth control to shrink the size but am experiencing side effects from the pill and still have discomfort in the R lower pelvic reg. My GYN advised to finish the prescription. Mean while she has not told me too many details about the results from either of the ultra sounds or what all my options are. She doesn't seem to believe the pain and discomfort is coming from the cyst but doesn't offer any other possible causes. I know my own body and I can feel a sm. mass in the R lower reg. upon palpating. This is the same place the pain is located. I need some answers and don't know what else to do. Please help me.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 60 yr. old female with a family history of heart disease. I am 25 lbs. overweight and have type 2 diabetes. I take metformin; janumet; caduet and until yesterday diovan. During a stress test yesterday my systolic bp rose to 260 in a very short time (diastolic was elevated but not so greatly). When my BP has been taken several times throughout the year at rest it has been 120/80 (ish). I am not very active but do walk 1-1/2 miles a day at a moderate rate. The cardiologist took me off of diovan and told me to begin 100 mg toprolol (sp?) immediately. He said it is important to continue to get exercise. I am fearful since I walk much faster and longer than I did on the stress test. I have a follow-up app't. in one month. The ultasound of my carotids and heart was fine. He mentioned abnormalities in the ekg related to my left ventricle. I assume if it was extremely serious I would have been hospitalized. Any info would be appreciated. I suppose I shoud have asked but at the time I was shocked. This discussion is related to extreme high blood pressure.,2010,2010,58,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,J Hepatol. 2009 Apr;50(4):712-718. Insulin resistance predicts response to peginterferon-alpha/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients. Dai CY; Huang JF; Hsieh MY; Hou NJ; Lin ZY; Chen SC; Hsieh MY; Wang LY; Chang WY; Chuang WL; Yu ML. Hepatobiliary Division; Department of Internal Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital; No. 100; Tzyou 1st Rd; Kaohsiung 807; Taiwan; Faculty of Internal Medicine; College of Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung; Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung; Taiwan. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Insulin resistance (IR) might be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to elucidate impact of IR and beta-cell function on the response to peginterferon-alpha (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty patients without overt diabetes were treated with combination therapy with (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin for 24 weeks. The IR and beta-cell function were evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) before treatment. RESULTS: HCV genotype; pretreatment HCV RNA level and pretreatment HOMA-IR; but not HOMA-beta; were independent factors associated with sustained virologic response (SVR). In 150 patients with genotype 1b infection; pretreatment HCV RNA level; HOMA-IR and age were independent predictors for SVR. The significantly lower SVR rate in high HOMA-IR patients was observed in 76 patients with high HCV RNA levels (400;000IU/mL) who were defined as 'difficult-to-treat' patients. The mean HOMA-IR of 'difficult-to-treat' patients was significantly lower in 42 sustained responders than in 34 non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: IR was associated with SVR to (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin therapy for CHC; especially among 'difficult-to-treat' patients. These findings suggested clinical application of pretreatment HOMA-IR could enable treatment outcome to be predicted and treatment regimens to be determined.,2007,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have Type 2 Diabetes and was put on Victoza yesterday; my doctor wants me to take this for weight loss. I would just like to know if anyone has lost weight or has had any side effects while taking this medication. I was on Byetta but the nausea never stopped and I felt bad all of the time. I took my first dose this morning of Victoza and so far there has been no nausea--I just hope it lasts. Any comments on this medication would greatly be appreciated. Also---my doctor has put me on lisinopril even though I don't have high blood pressure; he said this is a ACE inhibitor and will protect my kidneys. I have read BAD reviews on this medicine and I'm not sure what to do. I told my doctor yesterday that I was leery about taking this; but he seems to think this is a good medication to take.,2010,2010,45,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,According to the 65 clinical studies; PPC improved subjective symptoms and clinical findings such as pain in the right hypochondrium and hepatomegaly; biochemical markers of hepatic cytolysis; detoxification; excretion; synthesis; clearance and dyslipidemia; imaging data by ultrasonography or computed tomography; and histological evaluation of steatosis; necroinflammation and fibrosis. One study included a quality of life assessment by focusing on pain syndrome and dyspeptic symtoms. The first significant effects were observed after 4 weeks; with further improvements over the following months (up to 24 months). PPC was more active than diammonium glycyrrhicinate; ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); bezafibrate; and fish oil. A combination therapy of metformin; diet; exercise and PPC in patients with type 2 diabetes was more effective than metformin; diet and exercise alone. The same was the case for the combination therapy of PPC with UDCA. No relevant side-effects were reported. "Based on the pharmacological and clinical data; PPC would appear to be the drug of choice for significantly reducing or abolishing fatty liver of different origin; e.g. due to alcohol or obesity; even if the causing noxa cannot be eliminated; as is the case with diabetes-associated steatosis.",2017,2017,26,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband is 53 and was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in April of 2008. Prior to that time; he was in good health with the exception of a bad bout of Mononucleosis in 2001. Terry my husband has been a “shiftworker” for 35 years. As a result his lifestyle habits (in my opinion only) are not the best. His eating habits unless he is on night shift quite often include perhaps a light and late breakfast of toast and coffee and perhaps nothing all day or something light in early afternoon and a big supper usually late 7:30 or 8’ish. Some salads; some fruit but not a whole lot of either. He is mostly a meat and potatoes man. Although physically active around the home; he is not involved in any sports and; his employment is not in the normal course a physical one as he does some walking; etc. doing his checks but the majority of the time he sits monitoring panels. His sleep patterns over the years have become increasingly worse and it is not uncommon for him to be falling asleep in front of the television at 8 or 9 and then waking up at 3 or 4 and being unable to go to sleep again. When he sleeps after night shift it is usually only 4 to 5 hours and in the past two years; it is not uncommon for him to have a couple of hours or no sleep at all on his last night shift. As you can see; combined with his recent diagnosis of diabetes; he is not doing as well as he could although his sugar levels are surprising usually pretty good ranging between 5.5 and about 9.5. He is on Metformin 500 mg. (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening); Lyrica 75 mg. (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening) ; Avalide 75 mg. (1/2 a pill in the morning); Synthroid .1 mg. and Crestor (unknown); one of each in the morning. If his pre-supper reading is high; he takes a Gluconorm. We understand from the doctor that he may have been diabetic for between 3 to 5 years without diagnosis. Terry started out with some pain in his right leg that wouldn’t go away (Feb. 2008) and finally went to a walk in clinic in April of 2008. Hence his diagnosis. Since that time and the host of medication that he has been on; his heath has declined rather than gotten better. During June and July of 2008; he had extreme pain in his feet. Symptoms included burning. Stabbing pain; numbness that went up his legs and buttocks but ongoing extreme pain in his feet and an intolerance to anything enclosing his feet (shoes in particular) and therefore has been wearing sandals when at all possible. As we live in central; mid Canada; the winters go down to 40 degrees celcius at times and his life in many respects has become unbearable. During Mid May to July; he had been to an neurologist; had nerve conduction tests which he passed with flying colours; was subscribed a couple of additional meds (one of which was Prednisone) at different times to add to the Lyrica in hopes of getting his pain under control and hopefully find some type of answer as to why all this was happening. Cymbalta worked well in the beginning when combined with the Lyrica (and I think he was being weaned off the Prednisone) and reduced his pain so that it was manageable and for a brief period of time (most of the month of August); he was for the most part back to being the man he used to be. We paid for an MRI in August on his head. It showed nothing except a few muddy areas that his GP and Neurologist indicated were fairly normal for a man his age and that basically; it was “inconclusive”. In the fall; Terry’s pain became a little worse again and in his frustration; he went off the Cymbalta on his own. During that 3 week period which was scary for me has he wouldn’t go to the doctor about it he had little “blackouts” of several seconds but could still function through if that makes any sense in addition to the flu like symptoms normally associated with going off that type of medication. Essentially he tells me that that hasn’t made any difference. He has pain in the ball of his right foot which after much internet reading and desperation on my part; I thought perhaps he might have Morton’s Neuroma. Again; we waited for an MRI which scanned his feet and legs up to his hips. Again it showed nothing. The pain is increasing but we believe he is starting to be able to live with it rather than the fact that the pain has decreased. The pain now increases when he sits. The longer he sits the worse it gets. Numbness; burning…..pain in his feet that increases in intensity. Numbness; and burning spread up his legs into his buttocks and when he’s having a bad day it spreads to his arms; hands and the one side of his face. He has some “good” days which qualify as minimal pain and the ability to function well without trying to hide it all the time. Sometimes the good days last for 2 or 3 consecutive days but we don’t have these often. He’s also had a rash twice on the insides of his thighs but it seems to go away on its own. He also seems to get bouts of diahhria more often and for no reason but this too goes away after a couple of days. Also bouts of what we call flu which comes with it; the aching and swollen glands and sinus symptoms. Terry has always had off and on back pain and so we finally have a third MRI booked for June 1st to do his back. In the meantime; his quality of life has definitely taken a big hit; he is depressed and unhappy with the world and at times; his mood swings are horrendous to see and have to bear the brunt of. I have been watching his feet really carefully as neuropathy was the first thing that came to mind however; his feet are always a good colour and when he hurts them; they seem to heal in a normal time frame and in a normal manner. I have been reading on the internet a lot…trying to find anything that might give us a clue and thus far the only thing I can come up on Google Advanced Search is Chronic Lyme Disease. Actually this could be a possible as he an outdoors type of guy and we do a lot of camping in the summer and prefer out of the way places. Is there anything in my “rambling” above that might give you any other avenues to try?,2008,2009,53,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,It seems that even after a couple years of being on Armour; my T4 free has never went up; only has stayed the same and recently went down. I had my levels checked on 6/7/11 and they were as follows: TSH 1.32 (.55-4.78); FT3 2.9 (2.3-4.2); FT4 .09 (.89-1.76). Even though my numbers don't show hyper at all; my symptoms say otherwise at 60 mcg; which is what I was on when tested (just made another post on this; different question though). What can I do to get my FT4 up; or do I really even need to since it's the T3 that is the active hormone? Would this be more of an issue if I were on a T4 only med? Do you think it is even affecting the way I feel that much?,2011,2011,44,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been messed up since I got my first period at 11. They never seem to end and when they do it only stays gone a day or two. Especially if I have sex. Birth control pills helped for a while but never really answered the question "what's wrong w/ me?" So last October I wanted to get pregnant so I quit taking BC pills and started suffering. The doctors just always act like it is no big deal. I would like to know that I am not the only one who has to wear a pad every day. I would like to know why my body does this. I would like to know some way to fix it. I am a little overweight; I have recently been having painful pimples on my body and face; I do have some face hair. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I used to have a lot of pain; but I do not anymore. I am 25 years old,2005,2005,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'll thank everyone in advance for any help/advice. I am a 57 year old female very healthy and fit; but because of family history very worried about becoming diabetic. I also have thyroid disease. In 2007 I lost 40 lbs after my fasting blood sugar spiked for the first time. Since then my fasting blood sugar has been in the normal range and my A1c has been between 5.5-5.7 when tested. This past 90 days I had the best diet I could possibly manage and regular exercise; however not quite as much as usual. I am a mountain bike rider; tennis player and hiker; very intense exercise. So much to my surprise my latest A1c came back 5.8. I was expecting it to be much lower. I am at real loss; the endocrinologist I was seeing left our town and the closest is 2 hours away. I did see a new doctor; but I am not scheduled to see her again until May. My previous Dr. had briefly talked about me going on metformin. I guess my question is; should I be more proactive? Or do I just wait until I hit the 6.0 and get the diagnosis before I get treatment? I just don't know what to think? Help!!! Peggy,2009,2009,56,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been without smell/taste for almost one year. ENT examined via scope and MRI - nothing further. Opinion is that there was damage to the olfactory nerve from several bouts of sinusitis. Damage probably permanent (?) Over the past 3-4 months; I've been experiencing what I believe may be phantosmia. When I am around food there seems to be a foul odor much like a dirty cat box or spoiling meat. No one else smells it; it's very frustrating and disconcerting. This same sensation happens throughout the day; but tends to fade in and out. Is this some kind of phantom sensation; or is it possible that my olfactory nerve(s) could be regenerating?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have over the past few days been feeling `numbness and tingaling' in my lower right arm (the whole arm). I am on Metiformane Tablets 3 x day but found my reading was 15.3 yesterday so have increased tablets to 5 a day. Any suggestions on what else I can do for this. I do not have easy acess to Doctor or medicines at present. The urine I am passing is very dark yellow in colour it does not smell. I also do not feel 100% at any stage of the day or night and am taking Brufane Tablets for my back pain (as below). I also have a continious back pain which has been with me for the past 5 months. Seen a Ciro in Harare who basically said back is messed ( hit too many Landmines 20 years ago in a war :) )and have been taking Brufane Tablets about 6 a day which help with pain but not always so good. Also not sure if one should be taking this type of tablet for long time? Is there any other tablet that I can take that will effectively relieve the pain but not be harmful in the long run. The pain is not very sore but enough to get ones attention and effect sleep at night. Any suggestion would be nuch apperciated.,2008,2008,49,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi there; I gave up smoking around one year ago and since then and only now and then in the morning I wake with a really dry throat and a huge lump of phlegm in it. When I clear my throught the phlegm is dark green/brown and has what looks like fresh blood in it and I often wake up and and night have a taste of blood in my mouth....this must happen about once or twice a week. I've been to a doctor and they have sent me to a specialist and have asked for a chest x-ray...I had one about 9 months ago and it was clear... Should I be worried as I am to be honest? I don't suffer from anything else just that it feels like I have a lump in my throut sometimes......and the above mentioined. Also my voice is often hoarse and croky in the morning....as if i am still smoking.....and I am 27 years old. The only pain I get is sharp shooting from the left side of my chest and across my upper back where my shoulder blades are..... Kind Regards David This discussion is related to Symptoms of quitting smoking.,2009,2009,26,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I had some issues with microalbumin. That has since been resolved with my blood sugar now under control but my doctor said there was probably some level of kidney damage that I have to monitor. A recent blood test showed a BUN of 12 and a Creatinine of .6 with the GFR >60. All other metabolic tests were within the ranges. I thought those numbers were adequate but he mentioned some concern about the ratio between BUN/Cre and the low level of creatinine. I thought low blood creatinine was a good thing. I'm 42 yo and weigh 145. I try to watch what I eat and exercise and am on BP meds and Metformin. Any insight into these test results is appreciated. Thank you for your time.,2010,2011,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My father had a heart attack in the past; he did an open heart surgery to replace an artery in his heart. today his heart ejection fraction is at 43%. Doctors prescribed for him 8 different medicines that he should take regularly. We live in Lebanon; and medicine here is not as advanced as abroad; and doctors here are known to trade with people's lives; I'm no doctor and I'm not qualified to ***** any of these prescriptions; but i would appreciate an insight of an expert and/or a person who came across these drugs. I want to know if there are dangerous risks of taking this combination of drugs; and any other comment on the issue would be greatly appreciated. the drugs are: GLUCOPHAGE 750mg Pariet 20mg Isoptine 240mg VASTAREL 35mg Plavix 75mg Lipitor 20mg Aprovel 150mg LORAZEPAM 2mg Thank you very much.,2011,2011,22,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi! I had some bloodwork last week & got my results today . My A1c was 6.3 (which is down from my original 7.8) and my glucose level was 109 mg/dl. When I look at a1c charts ; it seems 6.3 coincides with a glucose level of 134. How can the bloodwork Glucose level from the bloodwork be 109? Shouldn't it be 134? Idk what is right. I started out meds in December 2014 but after finding this sight and getting info from here; I changed my diet to low carb and got off the meds ; so thanks so much for that help! But now I am confused about these test results,2015,2016,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 64 years old male and I have had COPD for several years; I recently quit smoking after serious pneumonia in 2016. Right after that; I have had persistent constipation and have been taking daily laxatives for the past 1.5 years and have been able to get motions with that except for the past few days I have developed a new problem where I am usually belching like crazy while eating and I ultimately have to stop eating just after a few bites because nothing goes down and it feels like the food is sitting idle where my food pipe meets my stomach and a burp is stuck there with is a huge urge to burp it out but I am unable to do so thats why I keep on belching to get rid of it to no avail. Sometimes the belching goes too bad that I vomit the food out. With this new problem another problem has arisen; I am getting almost no motions from laxatives at all now; all I get is a small amount of loose motions every alternate day or so; and sometimes just a few drop like consecutive installments of small amounts of loose stools. It always feels like stool is stuck down there and I strain to get it out but I can't. Since I have breathing trouble I haven't been able to consider the doctors request to get an endoscopy; but I just wanted to ask that are we supposed to take laxatives daily; since doctors in my place thought that it could be done? I have been taking one that is a mixture of sodium picosulphate and paraffin with milk of mangensia which is a strong laxative I suppose. One gastro told me that it may be the inflammation of the intestines that is hindering the motility of food. Also the color of my stool has become clay colored or pale colored but the other two mentioned a different story; Liver profile was normal; cbc was normal; ultrasound was normal; but I haven't had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy so far due to my breathlessness. Do you have any knowledge about these symptoms or any experience with such disease?,2017,2017,64,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I am new here and i hope i am not breaking any rules but my question ia about what effects smoking pot (marijuana) will have on my son (20yrs old) who is diabetic. I am not 100% sure that he is doing this but am sure he has tried it at least once and i want to be able to give him all the correct information about the dangers he is putting himself in before i speak with him about this. Of course there is the effects which will happen whether he had diabeties or not but i would be grateful for any advice which anyone may have on this subject.,2004,2004,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For six years; I believed there was a single-source connection between interferon resistance and interferon resistance. It is; as I suspected; a gene. The gene is SOCS3 - Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling-3. The discovery of this gene also sheds some light on why prior nonresponders have more trouble acheiving SVR. 1. SOCS-3 is elevated by HCV's core protein. 2. SOCS-3 elevation causes interferon resistance. 3. SOCS-3 elevation causes insulin resistance in the liver. 4. SOCS-3 depletion reduces liver insulin resistance; but causes systemic insulin resistance. 5. SOCS-3 is further elevated in people who have treated unsuccessfully. These findings suggest a new and viable target for therapy.,2003,2008,54,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,on 05/13/02 i had my blood taken for my life insurance policy my AST level was 18 and my ALT level was 28. On 07/29/03 I went to see the docter for frequent and loose bowl movements he proceeded with rectal exam;stool sample;urine test and blood test.AS for my blood test it came back with AST 24 and ALT 43.all other blood results came back normal. The ALT 43 has the word ABNORMAL next to it and he tells me in the letter i need to schedule an appointment.I am very worried about level's rising in a year's time.IS it something to be concern about?Knowing from the paper work it has something to do with my liver.I am 36 year's old;i was on ACIPHEX for 1 year but stopped taking it 1 month ago.I do not suffer from any pain and my appetite is very well; i have problem's with irregular bowl movement.I am very worried about this situation. thank you,2003,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am T2 diabetic; not well controlled; on glipizide 3xday; with numbers averaging 220. I suffer from Severe Depressive episodes and am in therapy and on medications for that. I have almost constant nausea; and BMs about 6x a day. I also have vaginal bleeding; which we think is from uterine polyps (biopsy scheduled). However; the most debilitating physical symptoms I have at present are the almost constant nausea; troubling BM's with a sickening odor and FATIGUE. It's difficult to tell which is causing which; but is there a reason that the diabetes would cause the nausea and BM problems? I currently have no insurance; thus no recent blood tests; but am hoping to get hooked up with a clinic after the biopsy.,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10 months ago.My doctor's instructions-Metformin twice a day;strict diet and exercise for weight loss;& use the internet to gain as much information on the disease as possible.I lost 45 lbs;A1c is now 6.3;& blood sugar and pressure levels are well within commonly acknowleged safe ranges.I am frankly angry and frustrated over the blatent lack of consensus and contradictory info on safe diabetic nutrition from these sources;all authored (it seems)by self-proclaimed 'expert' dieticians and ADA card carrying MD's.In particular-The info is directed at insulin dependent diabetics;rather than those;such as myself; who need to know specifically what differences(if any) in food intake we need to follow in order to avoid going on insulin.As a low income person without health insurance;the prospect of simply having to become a human pin cushion is unpleasant enough.But having to pay $4000 to $5000 a year out-of-pocket for insulin;testing strips;syringes;constant blood tests etc would leave me homeless--effectively;a death sentence. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I hope someone can help me with understanding the results of a cardiac CT scan. First a little history; I am a 51 yr old female; I had to have a hysterectomy at the age of 42 due to multiple complicated cycts of the ovaries; I have hypothyroidism; type 2 diabetes; COPD emphezema and am considered medically obese. Two years ago I had an echo but the results were noted as inclusive as it stated they were unable to obtain a clear image. My Dr. ordered the cardiac CT to ensure that my breathing issues were not impacting my heart. It's not one event that puzzles me but the culmination of multipe events. I was average weight 110-115 (I'm 5 feet tall) up until 6 years ago when I started to rapidly gain weight - I went from 112 to 172 in 1 1/2 years. Despite multiple pleas from me my Dr. had only run thyroid tests after all the weight gain only to find out my thyroid level was 89! Last Tuesday I had sudden and severe sharp chest pain; I couldn't take a deep breath. Because I had known the results of my CT scan I didn't think it was a heart attack so I didn't go to the ER. The first episode lasted about 20 mins and a second one later that night about 40 mins. I was thinking possibly gall bladder so I went to my Dr on Thursday. She ordered a sonogram which showed: normal pancreas; gall bladder; spleen; mildly complicated cyst on my right kidney measuring 3.5 cm and a complicated cyst with calcification at one edge and a single septation on my left kidney measuring 1 cm. Calcifications were noed in the liver consistent with old inflammorty disease. With the way my Dr spoke to me after these results; it seemed that she doesn't believe I had ever had the level of pain I complained of. I have been trying to lose the weight ever since I was diagnosed with hypothyroidsm and of course developed high BP due to the weight; and now type 2 diabetes. I was put on metformin about 2 months ago and it seems not long after I began to lose weight (nothing has changed as I've always been a concientious eater since diabetes does run in my family -on Dad's side); I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months and am down to 152 (yes I know still too high) however; my BP med was cut in half (I was taking 150 mg Avapro); I have been taking niacin and fish oil for 2 yrs which has done a wonderful job of controlling my cholesterol which is within normal ranges for about the same period of time. What is strange is my lower # still seems a bit high - today at the Dr. it was 112/90. About 3 weeks ago I had what is being called an allergic reaction to a med I had been taking for about 2 weeks - wellbutrin to stop smoking. The rash started in a small place; intensified into more like weeping welts and then spread everywhere except my face. I still have the rash 3 weeks later but it is much better as if it may be going away. The CT summary noted that no coronary artery disease was seen and the estimated likelihood of a flow-limiting lesion is < 1%. The CT showed and I quote "great arteries - both aorta and pumonaries"; pericardium - normal; normal RV systolic function; LV Mass 48 gms; aortic; mitral; tricuspid & pulmonary value normal; LV wall thickness normal & all 4 chambers of normal size; ejection fraction of 71%. Ok here is the confusing part - immediately following the EF is the notation 'possible diastolic dysfunction is suggested. Consider echo'. My Dr. never mentioned this to me; it wasn't until I read my report that I saw it. Should I be concerned? Should I call my Dr. and ask why she didn't mention this? My Dad had a history of severe angina (he had 2 heart attacks and 2 strokes the second of which killed him but and thank God that was at the age of 83). Some other things the CT showed: no pericardial effusion; there are small mediatinal and hilar nodes without adenopathy/mass; mild to moderate esophageal reflux; a moderate sized hiatal hernia; mild to moderate COPD emphysema and small airway disease suggestive of asthma or bronchitis; linear and nodular abnormality within the left upper lobe advise further characterization of the lung parenchyma; spondylosis thoracic spine noted; I haven't had any other events of chest pain since last week; however; I always feel exhausted and just not right. The bloodwork she ran shows my diabetes is well controlled (fasting was down to 97 woohooo); creatine kinase 20 - low (normal 29-143); urine analysis showed trace blood; trace protein; leukocte esterace 1+ (normal is negative); WBC 10-20 (normal < or = 5) squamous epithelial cells 10-20 (normal < or =5) bacteria - moderate; hyaline cast 0-5; WB cell count 17.8 (normal 3.8-10.8); hemoglobin 15.6 (normal 11.7-15.5); menatocrit 47.6 (normal 35-45); RDW 15.2 (normal 11-15); absolute neutrophils 12;104 (normal 1500-7800); absolute lymphocytes 4;664 (normal 850-3900); My Dr. put me on an antibiotic as she stated all of the above reflects a minor infection somewhere in my body - probably urinary. I am totally baffled by the possible diastolic dysfunction and with my history for reason of hysterectomy am wondering if all of the above could possibly be some type of autoimmune disease? Sorry for the length; but no one single thing above concerns me but the combination of everything that has me concerned,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 25 year old female; weighing 240 lbs. I went to the hospital last week with my asthma and they said ended taking my blood sugar because the sugar strip for my pregancy test turned brown. My blood sugar was 541. They kept me for both my asthma and the blood sugar; and ran some tests. my a1c was 7.7 which i am told is very high. They diagnosed me with type 2 diabetes. They think if i loose weight i might not need medication in the end. They sent me home on metformin and glypuride. Question 1: we splurged and had chinese food the other night at a buffet (but i still watched what I ate) I took my medication like i was supposed to and then went to walmart. We were at the buffet for at least an hour; so it was about an hour after i ate when we were walking around walmart i became very pale; felt really light headed; and very sick to my stomach. I thought maybe i ate to much; I took my blood sugar and it had dropped to 60. It was 126 before dinner. So what happened? I am so confused. Question 2: I feel kinda lost about the ranges I should be at. They said when I get up in the morning it should be between 70 and 120. Pre-meal (which is when I am supposed to test) should be 130 and under and if i ever test after a meal (2 hours) it should be 180 and under. Then they said to be careful it doesn't get to low. what is considered low. I know 60 is. Question 3: This kinda go with the last question. last night i took the wrong bus and ended up acouple a towns up from where I live. I ended waiting at the police department waiting for a ride home. I started feeling really light headed; and i had a fast heart beat. I thought maybe my blood sugar was getting low again since the last time i ate was at 2 and at this point it was 9 pm. When I checked my blood sugar it read 102; which i didn't think was low... any ideas on what was going on? Question 4: Last question; I promise. I just want to make sure my numbers are looking okay cause like I said; Im confused.all numbers are pre-meal unless stated otherwise. Friday 10- @7:41 am: 60 @6:34 pm: 166 (2 days after the hospital last day on stariods for asthma) Sat. 11- @7:58 am: 56 @9:35 pm: 136 Sun 12- @7:05 am: 72 @10 pm: 113 Mon 13- @7:45 am: 49 @4:09 pm: 105 @9:47 pm: 80 Tues 14- @7:22 am 87 @5:55 pm: 126 (this was the night it dropped to 60 around 7 pm) Wed 15- @7:24 am 81 @7:23 pm: 129 (stopped taking glypuride thought it could be the cause of drops) Thurs 16- @7:45 am: 86 @9 pm: 102 This morning at 7:50: 104 I appreciate any help and I am sorry for asking so many questions. I was gave as many details as possible cause I saw thats what someone suggested. Thanks again.,2010,2010,24,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,As many already know I am a G3a 2x non responder. Twice never been UND. Not bad for an apparently easy to treat geno type. Now if you are a non G1 non responder there isn’t much out there specific to your genotype. If fact looking for reasons for non response in non G1s just does your head in. Below is what I have learnt about NR. I don’t look at Genotype much now I look more at what the virus does to us and how we contribute. I look for what is common among NRs and what is different between NRs and SVRs. Genotype doesn’t have much to do with that. There are numerous virologic and host factors have been identified that impact the likelihood of SVR. Viral factors impacting SVR • Treatment Response (RVR; cEVR) • HVL -HCV RNA above 800;000 IU/mL More recent studies suggest above 400;000 IU/mL impacts SVR • Genotype 1 Among host characteristics; that been demonstrated to decrease the rate of SVR • Age • Age at Infection • Length of Infection • Sex • Cirrhosis; • African American race • Hispanic race • Bodyweight/Obesity • Hepatic Steatosis Other factors that decrease response rates • Alcohol • Iron Overload (Hemochromatosis) • Oxidative Stress • Insulin Resistance Below is what I have discovered about each of these negatives Alcohol Virology Journal http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/89 Effect of ethanol on innate antiviral pathways and HCV replication in human liver cells Infection with Hepatitis C virus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. With a propensity to progress to chronic infection; approximately 70% of patients with chronic viremia develop histological evidence of chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis; cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma. The situation is even more dire for patients who abuse ethanol; where the risk of developing end stage liver disease is significantly higher as compared to HCV patients who do not drink [1;2]. Moreover; HCV-infected patients who abuse alcohol have extremely low response rates to IFN therapy; but the mechanisms involved have not been clarified. To model the molecular mechanisms behind this phenotype; we characterized the effects of ethanol on Jak-Stat and MAPK pathways in Huh7 human hepatoma cells; in HCV replicon cell lines; and in primary human hepatocytes. High physiological concentrations of acute ethanol activated the Jak-Stat and p38 MAPK pathways and inhibited HCV replication in several independent replicon cell lines. Moreover; acute ethanol induced Stat1 serine phosphorylation; which was partially mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast; when combined with exogenously applied IFN-a; ethanol inhibited the antiviral actions of IFN against HCV replication; involving inhibition of IFN-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These effects of alcohol occurred independently of i) alcohol metabolism via ADH and CYP2E1; and ii) cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of ethanol. In this model system; ethanol directly perturbs the Jak-Stat pathway; and HCV replication. Ethanol did not appear to have significant effects on ISRE activity at 25 and 50 mM concentrations. However; at concentrations of 100 and 200 mM; ethanol caused statistically significant 3.0 (p = 0.03) and 5.0 (p < 0.001) fold increases in ISRE reporter gene activity; as compared to cells not treated with ethanol. The data suggest that high physiological doses of acute ethanol activate the ISRE; an IFN responsive promoter. This study is interesting because it implies a number of things 1.If you drink while on TX then you have to wait until your liver breaks down the alcohol and clears it before IFN starts working again. 2. The Anti-Viral effect of Alcohol is probably Oxidative Stress related. Not Good. 3. This could happen with other substances 4. The Don’t drink cause its like throwing fuel on to a fire brigade have some basis for their views other than the cr@p on alternative treatment sites; They may actually have a point; although the effects of Alcohol on the IFN signalling pathways were dose related; with very little impact at the lower concentrations. So once again it appears to be the quantity of alcohol not just alcohol per se. 5. Alcohol activates CYP2E1,2007,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,History: Undiagnosed/uncontrolled Diabetes since 2003... rapid weight loss of 70 lbs. without trying Hypertension; Thyroid (right half removed - noduoes) Gestational diabetes; uncontrolled tremor on right side. Diagnosed with diabetes type 2; and uncontrolled tremor (non keotic chorea-ballism) attributed to high sugars in 2013 after CT/Mri showed 2 lesions in brain. Along with tremor came occasional right side numbness/tingling of leg; arm; side of face; and back; foggy "out of it" feeling; resulting in getting to a chair fast or falling to the floor. No loss of consciousness. Treated with Haldol to reduce tremor; diabetes medication (metformin); and monitored. After about 2.5 mos. tremor resolved to occasional hand cupping and weakness. Symptoms above (numbness; tingling; falling) went away but are now back without the falls. Right sided heavy foot feeling; difficulty walking; numbness/tingling of right side (leg; arm; face) came back and ER trip resulted in diagnosis of TIA. MRI without contrast and with contrast showed no changes since 2013 incident. Today... total 24/7 numbness in both feet (neuropathy?) but no pain except occasional shooting/stabbing or burning sensations. Difficulty walking; feet feel heavy at times; sometimes one of both feet fall asleep while walking. General weakness; fatigue; memory problems; confusion; and feeling of something not right. At times numbness and tingling in leg; arm; and face come back... have taken blood sugar and blood pressure at these times and both are within normal range. Doc wants to take a wait and see attitude. Suggests that the symptoms that she at first thought were related to the Diabetes are NOT and might be part of a neurological problem such as Parkinson's. This is limiting the fun I should be having with my three year old! I cannot walk for long distances; at times I am having trouble driving (feeling where my foot is in space); not being able to feel whether foot is pressing down or not on gas/brake. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated!,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone...I'm new here. I like to read this forum; its very inspiring to know there are others; my age..who face smiliar issues with diabetes as I do. Every year..I've realised I go through a depressed/angry period with myself..because sometimes its very hard to control my blood sugar. I am a type 2; been diagnosed at 16; and I just turned 20. My family members cannot understand me...I dont expect them to. Sometimes I just eat like a normal person..I take tablets..Starlix and metformin. Usually I can control the bs for some days...then a few days later...Im in the 200 zone. How can I really become a serious diabetic? I smoke marijuana; because for me; it combines with my meditation and yoga..on a very spiritual level. I do not abuse it. Right now; I'm trying to avoid the urge of eating a lot after I take my smoke. I dont smoke cigarettes; and my alcohol intake is only Merlot(red wine). I am a runner 4 times for the week..and Im at my ideal body weight....130lbs for 173cm tall. My problem is control of the blood sugar; in an environment that is not very condusive for a diabetic. (having 5 other family members who eat everything). I would like to know...if there is a way to control urges. With yoga I've learnt clarity...but I cant seem to achieve control of urges. I can't EVER resist chocolates...ever. It scares me to know that in a few years...I will want children; and I know FULLY well if I dont maintain control continuously now...I will pay for it. So...I'm ready to heed to whatever advice I can be offered. Thanking you all in advance !,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have been feeling sort of down because of the prospects for me clearing this virus are dwindling up. Yes; I know; that I'm far from hopeless and that there's still time; and blah; blah; blah. But; I've basically been told that I can't do any of the protease inhibitors. I was thinking about trying to get into the Boceprevir trials; but I've been told; flat out; nobody will take me into a protease inhibitor trial because of my having been exposed to the Telaprevir in the Prove 3. I'm like; 'Oh terrific; so I'm like scr*wed?' Schering has told me this; the former trial nurse at my last study site has told me this. Whenever I inquire about the possibility of any other non-responder trials; nobody has anything available to me. I suppose that there is always hope that eventually there will be a polymerase non-responder trial; but whether or not that they will take me; is debatable. Waiting for a couple of years for one of these new drugs to be FDA approved really doesn't help me much because I have no prescription drug insurance; so I wouldn't be able to pay for them. So; I'm left with; do I just hope and pray that I progress none? Since I've had bridging fibrosis for 7 years; is that even likely? I am praying for a miracle because nothing I have tried has worked. I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad; or to just be a negative old grouch; but I'm really feeling down about this. I don't understand why I have been unable to clear! Susan400,2003,2008,46,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a type II diabetic on Metformin 750mg daily and would like to lose about 40-50 pounds in the next year. My A1C has been around 6.1 for the last 4 years; but I still have a hard time losing any wt. I belong to Curves and exercise 3-4 days a week. I try to keep my carbs at 60 per meal. Friends have lost wt using HCG injections and feel I would benefit from this; but did try HCG drops prior to my diagnosis ; and my blood sugars did go up to the 160-200 range. Strong family hx of diabetes; so want to control my blood sugars. Would I have the same problems with the shots? And would these harms my pancreas resulting in lasting problems?,2011,2011,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi folks; first time poster here in this forum. I've been taking Simvastatin for 5 years; and coincidentally during that time period my blood glucose levels have been steadily increasing from 100 to 162. My GP has told me that I have pushed thru the ceiling of an index that's used for determining risk. He has given me 90 days to pull it back; or I'm going on Metformin. I am what I would consider to be; a healthy; active; non-smoking 60 y/o male. I'm a bit overweight; but not excessive; and I don't think I go overboard on foods and drinks that would promote high glucose levels. The only change I've made in the last 5 years (other than aging!) is I'm taking Simvastatin aka. Lopressor. When I question my doctor about this; he immediately dismissed it saying the problem is with my diet. Has anyone else here notice the same; and if so could they point me to an authoritative source that I could direct him to?,2010,2011,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all. I am female and 28 years old; I have type 1 diabetes and I am on insulin. Mostly well controlled. Last December; I started having weird stomach problems where I lost my appetite to the point where I had starvation ketones; and would feel very nauseous and ill after eating the most basic foods. (Bananas and bread). I would start shaking and need to lay down. I phoned my GP and saw a nurse; got told it was just ''acid' or ''possibly an ulcer'' and given Omeprazole. 4 days later I got worse and ended up in an out of hours doctor in hospital and got given Domperidone for anti nausea so I could start eating again. After about 4-5 days I felt much better. I stopped taking the Domperidone and finished the 28 days worth of Omeprazole and I was fine by New Year. Fast forward to about 1.5 weeks ago; I start getting weird cramps in my lower back and stomach. Appetite slowly diminishing again and not feeling right. Cramps were in my left hip and radiated just under where my belly button is. Not severe but enough to cause discomfort in bed. I started putting a pillow under my knees and my back pain is completely gone but my stomach issues are really bad. I saw another nurse; sent me away with nothing and just said to come back if it gets worse. I called my doctors AGAIN yesterday morning; spoke to a doctor who didn't even want to see me and just prescribed more Domperidone and Lansoprazole 30mg once a day. I asked about a H. Pylori test and he dismissed it saying a lot of people have it and it causes no symptoms. He said if my stomach problems come back after this medicine then I need an endoscopy. I have had NO tests apart from urine the whole time I've been suffering with this. Urine is always clear. I took my first dose of meds yesterday afternoon; managed a sandwich and a yoghurt and went to bed about 4pm. I felt slightly better and less weak as I've really not been eating. I woke up about 11pm (I am nocturnal and work mainly nights so this is normal for me); I made myself some homemade vegetable broth with bread. I had some dark chocolate and a diet soda a bit later on. (Stuff I eat/drink all the time for years and never had any issues) I took my Domperidone and still felt kinda sick and didn't want to eat; but I forced myself. About 3 hours later; I now have bright yellow; completely liquid stool that burns. I feel horrible. I don't know if I should call my doctor back when it opens; call 111 or give the medicine longer than a day to feel any different as last time Omeprazole took 5 days + Domperidone to feel 90% better. I feel like something is really wrong with me; but my doctor said yesterday on the phone; ''Nothing you are telling me is raising any alarms''. My main symptoms are: - Nausea/malaise/feeling hot and clammy shortly after eating but NEVER vomited not even once. Nausea/unwell feeling comes in waves and seems to last maybe a few seconds to a minute and then it subsides - Abdominal dull ache that seems worse when I lay down. In December this pain was in my upper central abdomen; now it's below my belly button and my stomach in general feels almost tight and achy; like it's tired. - Hungry empty feeling in my stomach - On and off diarrhea. I had a normal BM when I woke up which slowly transitioned to liquid after going 2-4 times. - Very little appetite which is causing me to feel very weak and sick from not being able to eat properly As far as I am aware; I have no food allergies. I am on Metformin and Insulin for type 1 diabetes; and I take birth control; but I've been on all of these for 5 years and had no problems whatsoever. I am really annoyed that I have sought out medical attention for this so many times; yet no one ever orders any tests to actually investigate. I can't live like this. I already had a warning from work for taking time off because my uncle went missing. I work all over the country and the thought of a 3 hour drive with my unstable stomach is making it so hard for me to function at work.,2017,2018,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Seeing Kathy73 post about being SVR reminded me about the importance of losing weight before TX. If I recall she was very sensitive about being overweight. It is great she was still able to achieve SVR. Here are some studies why losing weight before treatment is important; not to mention other health issues from being overweight. Obese patients who are treated for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are more likely to have a better outcome if the underlying abnormalities caused by excessive fat tissue are corrected first; according to a review published in the medical journal Hepatology. The lead author; Dr. Michael R. Charlton of the Mayo Clinic; Rochester; Minnesota; and colleagues point out that obesity is considered to be a metabolic condition; not simply a matter of being very overweight. Obesity in patients with HCV infection is associated inflammation and insulin resistance; a "prediabetic" abnormality of blood sugar. These patients may also have steatosis; "fatty liver disease;" progression of fibrosis; scarring of the liver; and poor response to interferon and ribavirin; the standard treatment for HCV infection. Patients with hepatitis C and obesity-related fatty liver disease are also at greater risk for more advanced liver disease. Weight loss to reduce fat tissue is an important first step in improving response to treatment; the investigators advise. Also important is treatment with diabetes drugs; such as metformin and pioglitazone; to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation in the liver. This might reverse disease progression; the researchers note. Other approaches to enhance patients' response to combination drug therapy may include longer duration of treatment and higher doses to counteract the decreased response to the drugs. Rather than basing doses on weight; they suggest; drug doses could be based on body mass index; a ratio of height to weight. "Treatment strategies that focus on improving underlying metabolic factors associated with poor response to combination therapy;" conclude the researchers; are "more likely to overcome the low sustained viral response rates observed in obese patients infected with HCV." ____________________________________________________________________________________________ According to the results of the research; type 2 diabetes (DM); obesity and hypertension (HTN) are associated with overall and liver related mortality in hepatitis C (HCV) infected patients. In HCV-infected patients; the top three predictors of liver related mortality were having higher body mass index (BMI); presence of insulin resistance (IR) and elevated serum cholesterol. Overall mortality in HCV patients was most linked to metabolic syndrome; higher BMI and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical problems that increase risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects one in five people; and prevalence increases with age. Recent data have suggested that metabolic syndrome is associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients. This study set out to assess which aspects of metabolic syndrome are of most risk to such HCV patients and to quantify their specific impact on mortality. Professor Zobair Younossi MD; MPH from the Center for Liver Diseases at Inova Fairfax Hospital and the Executive Director of Betty and Guy Beatty's Center for Integrated Research; Virginia; USA; who led the study; said: "Exploring the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients helps us to better understand the complex nature of this highly prevalent disease. This study shows a clear association between key components of metabolic syndrome and mortality in HCV patients and demonstrates the importance of lifestyle improvements and coaching in the management of HCV patients; to potentially minimise the onset and impact of metabolic syndrome and its associated mortality risks.",2006,2010,52,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am on elavil for supposed acephalgic complicated migraines--I started on 10mg and am now on 25mg--and the dr wants to up it to 50mg. I have gained 6lbs in the last 2 weeks after upping the meds to 25mg. Plus; my vision is still not right. I haven't had another migraine; but the one I had was without headache (I got the numbness; loss of vision; etc.). Are there any meds out there that would work for being proactive with the migraines; but not cause the weight gain??? I am not happy with the gain!!!!!!! Thanks,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My Dad has had Two Bypass surgerys. One when he was 45 - leaving him with a graft to his RCA and OM and a Lima to LAD. Since then 16 yrs later. He has re occluded all but the Lima graft to Lad. He had another redo bypass off pump via transthorasic and replacing graft to OM 3 - as OM1 has a 95% stenosis and aneurysm they weren't able to fix it. OM 2 was full of clots and un-viable. His native circ ;prox lad and RCA is occluded. Has minor irregular to his left main. He is diabetic - type 2 on dimacron and metformin. He has been doing well since the second bypass two years ago with his EF at 40-45%. The last two months he has been short of breathe and chest pain daily. Repeat Muga scan shows his EF now at 19%. He does drink alcohol about 3-4 glasses of rum a day despite knowing he shouldn't. He has slight renal impairment with a creat of 120-150 at times He also has had three strokes in the past - leaving him with mild weakness only to one side and poor vision. Sounds bad right !! My question is .... Does he even have much chance left to improve his EF ? Knowing most of his blood supply to the left ventricle muscle is blocked ? Is it just a matter of time ? We are feeling desperate and hoping he can get some help but also trying to be realistic. I doubt very highly he is a transplant option. Any advice or helpful suggestions would be appreciated. Even a life expectancy - whether good or bad would be nice. He's not on oxygen at this time.,2013,2013,,Female

I have fought several Staph infestion over the last 3 years; never had it before that. I've been to GP; and Dermertoglist. I will add my Rx; and med history below. Every time the Dr. would put me on Antibotics for my staph; and about a 1-1 1/2 all the bumps in my head would clear up. After about 2 weeks after stopping they would come back. This has happened several times. Had Amoxcillen and Bactrian. The Dermotogists started me on Bactroban Cream 2% bid. He told me that he would probably have to give me antibotics to take on a daily basis. I haven't had any Staph since I started using this cream. I'm sure all the medicines I'm on doesn't help either (see below). It don't help that I can't keep my hands off of them. But if they wasn't there I wouldn't touch them. I know it's not me picking them that is causing them; when I'm on antibotics they go away. I just haven't been able to go back to Dermotoglist because low of funds. Any help is appriecated.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My resident doctor put me on Actos30 with long injection of Lantus in evenings. I was on Actos and rejected it early in the year...because; now as before; it caused me to swell; especially in the middle of my body. I woke up in night needing to go to the bathroom; none of my clothes fit. When I beat my mid-area like King Kong; I was playing a drum!!! And; mentally; I was ready to kill!!!! A week ago I didn't realize that pill had fallen on the floor and when I found it next morning; determined it was an act of God! I felt better even by Tuesday evening. Today; I have no urgency and have lost the major bloat--but BS is about 15 points higher and won't go below 215 on FAST.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I found my blood sugar at 17.8 last night. I have a lot of symptoms like palpitation; dizziness and very tired. I took 2.5mg of the minidiab. After that; I have a packet of bean curd puff and some dry longan (dry fruit). After 3 hours; I went to bed. This morning I take my blood sugar again before breakfast (fasting). It is 6.2. I'm curious; is 2.5mg of minidiab really can lower the blood sugar that much? Or my meter something wrong......? Again after 2 cups of coffee; I felt very very dizzy. I take my blood pressure; it is 112/85. My chest is very tight; it looks like an elephant sitting on it. Were these symptoms are part of the blood sugar 17.8 which damaged to my organ? Or could be my blood sugar raises to 17.8 again? I think it is impossible for 2 cups of white coffee without sugar can raise the blood sugar so much! Just too scare to do another blood glucose test. Any one has those experience or come across those symptoms? Could some one give me an idea what should I do next?,2005,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've recently been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and started testing my blood glucose at home with the One Touch Ultra 2 monitor. The test strips that I've been given are pre-coded; so I do not have to do anything to my monitor prior to testing; other than insert the strip. I have a couple of questions and I apologize if they sound stupid - I'm still trying to get used to all of this - I've only been diagnosed and testing for a little over a month: 1) Can/will your blood sugar reading vary depending on which finger you use for the sample? A few times; especially today; I noticed a vast difference between the middle finger on my right hand and the middle finger on my left hand. For example; I was feeling a bit shaky like maybe my sugar levels were low; so I tested using the middle finger on my left hand - it read 62. To double check; I then did a test on the middle finger of my right hand (about a minute after the first test) and got a reading of 143 (I had not eaten or drank anything in between tests or for several hours before the tests). This is not the first time this type of "difference" has happened; although this was the most drastic difference. It's not always a difference between left and right hands - sometimes simply different fingers on the same hand 2) Because of this vast difference; how do I tell which is the most accurate; so I know how to treat and/or notify my doctor? I'm currently taking Metformin and Glimepiride and of course; if my sugar is already low; I don't want to make it any lower by my meds - but if I'm getting conflicting readings; how do I tell? 3) Is it better to always use the same finger for testing or better to switch fingers each time? Of course; I'd rather my fingertips not get sore from testing; but if it's better/more accurate to always use the same finger; I'll put up with a little tenderness. Any other tips for the most accurate testing would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,2009,2011,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello~I have not been diagnosed as a diabetic; and my last A1C was 5.8. However; lately; my morning fasting levels have been higher than normal and I am worried. My doctor says it is stress related as I am releasing a lot of cortisol; but; still; I am concerned. My stresses are: starting college soon; taking some tests; my fiance having major surgery; illness in the family.I am 52 years old; and try to eat right. My morning readings used to always be in the 80's; then; two weeks ago the night before my boyfriends surgery; I checked it before bed; and it read 154; I could have fainted; just two hour previously; it was 110. The next morning; 5/4 instead of being in the 80's; it was 106 fasting for 9 hours;(this was the day of his surgery); it finally went down that night to the 80's again. The day after that; 5/5; it was 105 and stayed there all day; after I ate a low carb meal; it went to 122 two hours after. The next morning; 5/6 it was 98; I don't mind that. Well; on 5/7; I woke up with a horrible tummy ache; the docs think now it was food poisoning; I was sick as a dog; I took my sugar at 4 in the morning thinking it was too low; but; dang; it was 148; I had eaten some tums however prior to that and they are full of sugar. It stayed elevated until 10:32 that morning; and my fasting was 118. The next mornings; 5/8 through 5/12; my fasting was in the 90's; then yesterday; on the 13th; it went up again to 102; I had some school tests and such coming up and was nervous. This morning; the 14th; it was 107. So; as you can see; I have been a mess. I charted all this and gave it to my doctor; she said not to worry; that it was stress related and the more I worry; the higher it will go; also; my period started yesterday; and I understand this can elevate it too. In the past; I have always been hypoglycemic; so; this is new to me. I guess I should try not to worry; get more exercise and keep a record for a few weeks before I panic. My boyfriend has just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; so now I am more nervous about it; his numbers; however were awful; the doc got him at over 470; he is doing better though and sticking to his diet and his metoforim is really helping. Anyway; have any of you had the numbers fluctuate like me and been told it is stress? I am in high anxiety right now; and I am really worried. I also have irregular heart beats; GERD; and panic attacks; so; I am a member of many forums. My chiropractor helps a lot as does my acupuncture treatments; but; I still worry. Thanks for reading this. Susie,2007,2010,52,Female

Have had Migraines in the past with flashing lights; but not frequently and only treated with 2 Aspirin or 600mg of Ibuprofen. I have had 11 episodes since June.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Just received results and am trying to decide whether to push Dr for referral or let it ride for now. Do have symptoms but Dr. is fairly resistant to treating thyroid. TSH: Aug. 2.5 0.450-4.50 Sept. 3.090 0.450-4.50 T4 Sept 7.6 4.5-12.0 T3 uptake 26% 24-39 Free Thyroxine Index 2.0 1.2-4.9 Thyroglobulin antibody 1.1(H) 0.0-0.9 Thyroid Peroxidase(TPO)Ab <5 0-34 I thought there was a T3 test in there and if there was it was 3.8; I think but can't remember the reference range except to say is was shaded towards the lower side. Will call again and see if they actually did do one or not. May have been mistaken or another test. So; does this look fairly normal? TIA!,2014,2014,,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hmmm; I'm just looking for advice on what kind of doctor I need to see to pursue this problem. I am a 51 yr old female with Type 2 Diabetes and currently taking glucophage 1000mg once daily. Saw my PCP for "memory loss" and she ran tests revealing a vitamin B12 deficiency; went in weekly for 4 wks for shots; then every 3 wks. In researching this problem; I've found that many symptoms I have experienced for years can be attributed to this deficiency which include: daily headaches that feel like I've been pounded on the top of my head w/a hammer that feels like it goes down through my c-spine and into my back which seem to improve right after the injection but come back toward the end of the 3 wk period; brain fog/memory loss; joint pain; loss of enjoyment in reading because my eyes get tired and vision seems to get blurred; cannot think of words (i.e.; "that thing you wear on your head" for "hat"); some occasional numbness in left arm; right shoulder pain; and am unsteady in the dark (especially going down stairs) I was also recently dx'd with an anal fissure from chronic diarrhea I've experienced for many (5+) years. Many endo/colon-oscopies that show everything to be fine in that dept - no colitis (but w/fissure and B12 deficiency I suspect maybe Crohn's?) but have been on Prevacid since 1999 for severe GERD. I had my most recent injection last week; but had B12 level checked prior to receiving shot. PCP called to tell me that for someone who gets injections monthly it isn't very high - 310. So...what kind of specialist do I need to see? A hematologist or a neurologist? She thought I should see the GI guy to r/o Crohn's but I'm a little worried about the B12 level at this point and my memory loss. I used to be a "sharp cookie" but it's fading fast... Any ideas?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi all; My husband is at week 25 of his 3rd tx try; this time with Alinia added. He has compensated cirrhosis so there is an urgent reason to succeed. The Alinia has made him a much better responder but it is still falling short as he is responding too slow. It was planned to have him stop after the 24th week if he wasn't nondetectible. At 20 weeks his viral load was 207 and at week 24 it was 250...not good. The doctor's office called and said not to quit yet and we have an appointment on December 2nd to decide what to do. The reason they decided not to stop right now was because his ALT came back as "18" which was certainly a beautiful number to behold. The treatment has made him sick with lots of nausea most of the time and he looks like a wreck at this point but we know it is a long wait until Teleprevir comes out and we sure don't want to leave any stone unturned if there is any chance of success. Does anyone have any brilliant ideas to push Joe to nondetectible? Yes; I'm asking for a miracle. We sure would appreciate prayers. Thanks; Ev,2007,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Is there any way medication which people with pcos can take to help them with weight loss? What i have read suggests that the only way to control it is through diet and exercise. I'm asking because my friend who has recently been told that it is likely she may have PCOS goes running for an hour a day and never eats heavily but still manages to put on weight easily. e.g last week she put on over a stone despite exercising and eating well everyday. There isn't a lot more she can do to control her weight even if the PCOS s confirmed (is curently waiting a scan). Btw; she has been seeing her doctors for years now about her struggle to lose any weight and also has irregular periods; some acne and problems with regular bad stomachs/tiredness. Any help much apprecated as she's very depressed about it.,2010,2010,,Male

When my sugar drops to 150; I get really tired; weird feeling in my legs and nauseas. For someone like me who constantly has a high blood sugar is 150 considered low? Also can high blood sugar be related in any way to weight loss? I am experiencing some weight loss and I am not sure if it due to my sugar; the fact I was taken off Avandia and put on Junovia because I know Avandia increases weight or if something else is happening to me.

I also have hemochromatosis ; diabetes (type 2) and extremely high blood pressure which I take meds for the last two (diovan hct; mepropolol; and metformin and zocor for cholestoral); and have had regular phlebotomies (blood letting); for the last year and a half; finally getting my iron levels down to acceptable levels for the hemochromatosis. My doctor is monitoring my heart now and says it is just best to follow this course and hope that the blockage dosent increase.My questions are these; do you think the hemochromatosis can have had an effect on my heart; I understand that it can cause heart failure? Can this lead to a heart attack? I wonder if surgery will ultimatley be an option; and what can I expect for the future?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am having trouble keeping my thoughts straight so bear with me plz. Tegretol did not work out and I am now on haladol. What older antipsychs are left on the list? I cannot concentrate right now long enough to do the research myself. I need the antipsych to function as I become paranoid and delusional w/o them. My dr will not or cannot discuss treatment strategies for the future w/me if this fails also. I feel like my back is up against the wall and am feeling pretty hopeless at this point.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Ima write EXACTLY what it says in the magazine! A decade ago Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) was a little known; and little understood condition. Today its the most common hormonal disorder among women of repoductivve age and the main cause of infertility in UK women. What's more; some experts believe that Polycystic Ovaries might affect as many as one in four women;; and that the number of sufferers is likely to rise further; thanks to modern life styles. Polycystic Ovaries are caused by a large number of Cysts (Fluid filled sacs) that grow just below the surface ofone or both ovaries. When a woman displays some or all of the collection of symptoms normally associated with Polycystic Ovaries she is said to suffer from PCOS. GP an author; Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'With PCOS; the ovaries produce too many male hormones; such as testosterone which block the normal monthly growth and development of egg follicles; creating the cysts. Most women with Polycystic Ovaries are less responsive to insulin; the hormone that regulates blood sugar; putting them at an increase of Diabetes. 'The main symptoms include oily skin or acne; increased facial or body hair and thinning hair on the scalp. 50% if sufferers are overweight or obese and 70% of women with PCOS have light or irregular; or miss periods' Not only is PCOS a ticking time bomb for the future of our fertility; if left unchecked; its also linked to serious health issues; such as Type 2 Diabetes; heart disease; and endometrial cancer. The statistic most quoted is that One in Ten women have PCOS: says Norah Lane; founder of Diet Care. 'But the real number is likely to be much higher. One in four women is thought to have Polycystic Ovaries; but they may not display any symptoms or not make the connection between the smptoms they are experiencing and the condition. Many women don't get diagnosed with PCOS untill they start trying for a baby; and; even then they might have been trying to conceive for some time before seeking help. It's no wonder that the latest figures sow that more women than eer are undergoing fertility treatment in the UK' Natalie Cassidy and Jools Oliver (Famous peeeeeeoples) who have been diagnosed with PCOS; both gave birth in the last few weeks. Both have spoken out about thir struggles to convieve; making their new arrivals a double blessing. Other stars with PCOS include Victoria Beckham; Tana Ramsay and Zoe Ball. The Trigger for PCOS is unclear but most experts think genetics plays a role; since it tends to run in families. There is NO cure; But symptoms can be managed with some lifestyle adjustments. 'A lot of the symptoms of PCOS can be improved by diet; exercise and supplements:' Says Dr Brewer. Follow a low GI diet because balancing blood sugar leels can improve insulin resistance; Try to lose excess weight - even a modest loss of about 1 st (6kg) can correct hormonal abnormalities; reduce acne and unwanted hair and improve fertility. Regular exercise helps to overcome insulin resistance in muscle cells and can also improve mose PCS symptoms. GPs sometimes perscrie a drug called Metformin which can imporve insulin sensitivity.' If you suspect you might suffer from PCOS; speak to your GP. 'You don't have to put up with your symptoms;; says Norah. 'There's lots you can do to help yourself.' What can you do? 'Medication may help in the short term; but in the long run; healthy eating is the single biggest way to improve the symptoms' Says Dietcare founder Norah Lane. 'PCOS is a hormone imbalance and sufferers are particularly senstive to all the chemicals we are expsed to in our modern lives. Avoid porcessed foods and buy organic whenever possible.' 'You can also try eating tiny a tiny piece of protein such as chicken; turkey; egg; fish cottage cheese every 15 minutes;' advises Norah; 'These can help to speed up the metabolism; provide essential vitamins and stop hunger pangs. Other PCOS- friendly foods include strawberries; raspberries; blueberries and organic vegetables.; Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'Supplements that might help to alleviate symptoms include evening primrose oil; isoflavones; magesium supplements; B Vitamins; Chromium; and Angus Catus. Saw Palmetto may be suggested but should only be taken by women under thee supervision of a medical herbalist.' This is in England but it might help with others with the info I found out... the Figures of people having it are based in England no where else... Hope this helps?? x,2010,2010,16,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband went to a doctor in mid April with pain in his feet. At that time he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes; high blood pressure and thyroid issues. Since that time; he has brought his glucose levels down to normal range (4-7) and remains on Metformin; Crestor; Lyrica; Synthroid and sometimes Gluconorm. Although his levels including his blood pressure have dropped to normal range; his feet continue to feel like they are in a vise. Sometimes it changes so they barely hurt at all but those periods are less frequent as time passes. Currently; he is in incredible pain almost continually and gets no relief. There are also episodes of tingling; burning and sensitive skin in his arms as well as his feet and calves. It feels best when he is standing although that is painful too just less so. Tylenol 3's do nothing for him and he is in agony. MRI has shown some minor "delineation in his spinal sheath"? and we currently await "another" neurologist to look at the results to determine if it could possibly be the onset of MS or whether it is possible that it may be diabetes related. What can he do for the pain? He is going crazy.....,2008,2008,52,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I am 23 years old and about 9 months ago I was told I have PCOS. I believe I have had it since I started having periods since I had many of the symptoms. The only symptom I never experienced (until recently) was weight gain. All growing up I was a very small child and throughout high school I was the same. My highest weight in high school was no more that 110lbs. I have never struggled with weight; until a few years ago. After I got married (and our eating habits only changed for the better) and shortly before marriage; I started putting on the pounds. Quickly! Within 5 months I had put on 30lbs then three months later 40 more! I couldn't believe my eyes. I never had this issue before! That's when I saw my OB; after being diagnosed I was told I needed to lose weight because thats what caused the PCOS; but I don't believe it; it just doesn't add up to me. Why the sudden weight gain? They lectured me and lectured me because I want to get pregnant and am obese now. All I have been told so far is I have to lose the weight; but I am exercising and eating right and I see nothing! I was put on Metformin 500mg 2X a day after being diagnosed and I have seen no change in weight or facial hair! I am frustrated because I hate the way I feel being this large. I guess my main question is are there ANY success stories out there of women losing weight with PCOS and taking metformin? I could really use some encouragement. I want so bad to start our family; but if I am this uncomfortable being my weight now; I fear how I will feel being pregnant.,2010,2010,22,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Ok so first I'm 32 years old and 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed type 2 diabetes; I have been taking Metformin 500mg twice a day for 2 weeks with no side effects. This morning I was especially happy to find my blood sugar at 115 been below 200 since I started medication but then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and took my shirt off and BAM! both armpits had very dark blue in the middle yellow on the edges bruises; so big they took up the entire pit and some of the arm! Well I called my Dr who was going to call me back; 2 hours later I'm scared reading about leukemia (dad just got through with his treatments) and said to hell with this i'm going to shower. I took a very hot shower; the Dr called an hour after I got out; were talking and while I have her on the phone I go to look at them again to describe them and TAH DAH! All gone; and I dont mean slightly faded I mean gone; like magic. Did the Hot water do it? Did an hour do it? Please if anyone knows anything let me know.,2015,2015,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Saw hepatologist finally. Labs good; physical exam good. Geno 1a VL 2.5 iu/ml. Contracted 1988 from a blood transfusion. Dr requested more labs (pt/ptt/hiv/hbv/hav...) to make sure I am ok to schedule for my first biopsy (YUCK). I asked her about my fatigue (which I have had for years and attribute to my busy life) and I asked her about my headaches (which I have had for about a year now and have tried many drugs with no luck). She said probably not HCV related? This is contrary to what I have read? She also explained to me that treatment will be based on the damage already done. Meaning if on a scale of 1-10 in 20 years I have only advanced to a 3 in damage she would recommend not treating because new drugs should be out within the next 10 years. My question is what if my body decides to accelerate damage now since I am almost 40yo. My thought is I should still treat to reduce the VL or I could participate in a clinical trail? Advice from the experienced Heppers please to help me understand why I should decide not to treat. THANX,2007,2007,,

I made sure there was no air in it a drop of fluid was on needle. I worked up the nerve to stick it in. when I started to put it in. some came out of the cap thingie. I stopped. Made sure it was on better and finished. But I felt fluid run down prior to fixing. Now I have no way of actually knowing how much I wasted.. I never do get out any extra (if there is any?) because I cant see the writing on it. Ive been contemplaiting what I should do. Should I give myself a little more? I would hate to fail tx. because some came out of the part that attaches. And why is it even like that? My vet gives me needles that are eighter attached or screw on. And that would prevent spillage.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Where to start??? Ok I am a 37 year old male. Former cocaine addict. 4 years clean. Thank God. 2 1/2 years ago I started getting these symptoms. It felt like a Head cold. Felt like wet forehead (inside). Couldn't concentrate; sometimes confused low ambition; poor memory; cranky. Lose track of what I was doing. Gazing alot. Ears slightly blocked; tingling in different parts of my head. Just like a head cold. Here is my problem!!! It has never left!! I was convinced it was a head cold because of the blocked ears wet tingling sensations etc... So I went to doctor; he thought it was anxiety or stress induced. New changes in my life; moved to new town; off drugs; new business etc.. So he prescribed celexa. I am no longer cranky; more calm; but other symptoms are still here. Then 1 year ago was my worst year. Could hardly work. Tired constantly; bone dry tongue; eyesight blurry. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. So I take metformin. 500mg 2times a day. Symptoms are still here. I am not tired any more. I can make it through the day; no problem. I seem to need about 10 hours sleep. I have problems with insomnia. I take an over the counter sleeping aid often (Unisom; by Pfizer). So I am left with the can't concentrate; bad memory; low ambition; forgetfulness; ears slightly blocked can't focus on work. I have my own business again starting up. I had lost my old business due to the tiredness from the diabetes I didn't know I had for 6 months. I am scared that I can't handle the full time business again. What is this head cold thing?? I started thinking it was to do with nervous system; or immune system. It really feels like a head cold I never get healed from. So much so; sometimes it gets worse and when people talk load my ears cut out. Is there fluid in my head that won't go away? I need to live a normal life again. I feel disabled. I am only 37 and want to start getting healthy but have no motivation. Someone please help. I forgot to mention I also gained 30 pounds that has never left when symptoms started 2 1/2 years ago. I am 195lbs 5.5 height. Right now my head is tingling and ears slightly blocked; can't concentrate etc... I got bells palsy also 4 years ago. It left within 3 months. Please help.,2007,2007,37,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Well; the symptoms I was having prior to my last post about the MRI news and the Rasmussen's Encephalitis dx probability and what happened from there. The day after I posted; I got a call from my doctor's ofc which said my hemoglobin was 7.4 and I needed transfusions asap. I had to enter the hospital cause they couldn't fit me in as outpatient and that way I could see a neurologist about the MRI results. Prior to that; I'd been having light headed spells; weakness; and right leg pain; plus aphasia. After I got some blood; the hemoglobin didn't go up much; so I got a second transfusion. I had asked for some antibody tests for diabetes the last time I had labs and finally found out they were positive which meant I do have type 1 - NOT type II. Talk about frustration!!! If I didn't research my own illnesses and ask for my own tests - I'd be dx with the wrong things. It does make me upset. The diabetes just wasn't making any sense. My diet; weight; history etc. just didn't fit with type II and did fit with LADA - Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults. It means I may need insulin asap to keep from destroying all my B cells. Of course that means another uphill fight. As far as the neurologist - he said he'd never seen RE in anyone - much less an adult - so in his gut he didn't think I had it. It was too rare! I wondered if he'd looked at my chart - I'm the essence of RARE cases. The MS shows increased lesions but none enhanced ; but the hemangioma and degeneration of the junction of the spine at the foramen magnum is frightening. I didn't think that much of it cause everything pales in comparison to the RE. We're going to do a follow up MRI in 2 - 3 months. While I was in there; I had an EEG; an LP; an MRI; and MRA; and Upper Endoscopy to try again to find a bleed. The Hematology - oncologist thinks I just fail to absorb iron and gave me an iron infusion (which I've had before with no problem) However; this time; I had a massive bilateral backache and a soaring BP so they had to stop and give me a different kind. I'll have to get them once a week basically forever - with breaks. I will also have IVIG infusions - high dose for 5 days straight then once a month forever. This will hopefully help a lot of things. But; frankly; I think I don't have much time. My Blood glucose went to 213 while fasting over 30 hours and when I got home; I was sweating so bad during the night; I tested and it was 254! I'm quite concerned. My insulin levels are low; c-peptides low; and GAD high - Autoimmune Diabetes. WHAT Autoimmune disease DON'T I have?? I've slept pretty much since I got home Sat night; so have to arrange things tomorrow to start these new treatments. I've gotten so weak on my right side (and left - just not as much) and the aphasia scares me big time. It's embarrassing to not be able to talk well. Having things that doctors don't know about and that research says has to be treated early puts a lot of pressure on me. I can't see the best doctors due to having Medicaid and it's getting really frustrating cause there's no one else to ask. Blessings everyone. I thought I'd update and vent a bit. I need it.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've been suffering from Hypothyroid for over a decade now and I've been on the Synthroid since they found it. It helped mostly I never felt %100 again but it was a lot better then how I was feeling before. Back in 2010 things began to change again the symptoms all came back but even worse this time I put on over 100lbs in less then three months my hair; nails and skin dried out so badly I started losing them hair and nails I mean and my skin was so dry it was splitting open because I was gaining so much much weight and my skin was so dry it couldn't handle it now I'm covered in major scars. I've seen nearly half a dozen doctors since because they kept sending me to see one doctor at one clinic then they would send me to see this other doctor at this other clinic they even sent me to see a doctor in another city 3 hours away and had more tests then I can count. One day everything seems "normal" the next day my cortisol and ASTH are not even detectable and my prolactin levels are sky high then by the next blood tests everything is back to normal light nothing it wrong My TSH and T3 and T4 levels never change no matter how low or high they change my Synthroid dose to and lastly my Insulin levels are around 720 with a normal fasting glucose. I have had 3 MRI's which showed no masses on the pituitary gland I do however have three large nodules on my thyroid which do cause a lot of pain horse voice and choking that are apparently not in the way according to my last surgeon even tho I feel like I'm being stabbed in the neck all the time. I'm always tired; weak; sore; lazy; grumpy; dizzy; confused; sweaty; constipated; cold; dry hair skin and nails and I always have massive headache. I take my synthroid and metformin every day I'm Canadian so I can walk in to any doctors office any time and get as many tests as I like for free if anyone can give me any insight that me or my last 6 Endocrinologists haven't thought of I would be forever in your dept.,2009,2016,38,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 32 years old and have had sensory neuropathy for the last 2 months over my entire body. It began in my feet and rapidly spread throughout my legs; up through my torso and from my shoulders down; then up into my neck. This occurred over a few days. After several trips to my doctor and eventually an internal medicine doctor; then neurologist; no one could figure out a reason. I have type 2 diabetes and was officially diagnosed 4 months ago; but it is in control. The internal med doctor initially suspected Guillain Barre'; but an EMG ruled that out (it was normal). I've had an MRI of my cervical spine and one of my brain. I've had comprehensive blood tests to rule out anything else. I'm on Metformin (for blood sugar) and Avapro (for hypertension). I recently went on these meds; about 2 months before symptoms began. The numbness seems to be a bit worse lately in my right leg and this scares me. The other neurologist I've seen recently says to take a wait-and-see approach since I have no other symptoms. I'm very worried and would like to know what is going on before the numbness spreads any further. I have two toddlers and need to expend my energy with them; not worrying about my health. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I am a 49 year old mother of 2 teenage daughters. Just over a year ago I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for which I am now taking Metformin 500mg a day. I am also taking meds for high cholesterol and high BP. I am taking Thyroxine for Hypothyroidism (under active) - Thyroxine 100mcg daily - a condition that I have had since 1997. I am 3 stone over weight at 13stone 7lbs (and need to lose it). I have also had the condition PCOS since the early 1990's; which caused me fertility problems; for which I needed some medical intervention with. I have what is called I suppose 'Metabolic Syndrome' and find it so hard to lose the weight - although I should also exercise more. My worry is that for a few years now and moreso recently I have experienced slight burning sensations with dull pain on the left side of my chest radiating into my shoulder blade and arm. This happens intermittently and there is no pattern to it at all. I am worried because of all the above problems that I might be developing heart disease? I have had ECG's done in the past which are always normal and I also did an exercise stress test; which was also all normal (approx 2 yrs ago). Also for a few years now I have experienced pain that generally starts in the base of my throat and can radiate to my jaw; teeth; sometime ears and down into across my chest and can last for 5 to 20 mins. My doctor thought it was osophogeal spasm and sent me for a barium swallow - which ws normal - could this be related?,2008,2010,48,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 51 year old semi overweight woman. In the past few months I have been diagnosed with: Diabetes Type 2; Acid Reflux; Hypertension. I also have Asthma and nasal allergies for years. I am on Metformin twice a day; Nasonex spray once a day; Proventil asthma pump when needed; Aciphex once a day; I was on Quinapril once a day; but since the cough they took me off of that and put me on Diovan once a day. OK here is the problem. When I started the Quinapril over 2 months ago; a few weeks later I developed a tickle in my throat cough. I went to the doctor 3 weeks ago and she took me off the Quinapril (she said it was causing the cough) and put me on Diovan and said the cough should stop. It has not stopped. I can't even go to the movies without coughing. I get these coughing fits to the point that I sometimes gag and throw up the last meal I ate. I am constantly sucking on sugar free cough drops. I have also taken two bottles of sugar free cough syrup and nothing seems to work. Some nights I can't even sleep. I am wondering if it could be something else. I also have had HPV for a few years and read that it can affect your throat. I got back to the doctor in 2 weeks. What should I ask her to do?,2009,2009,51,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had a colonscopy about a year ago and my bowel movements right after the procedure changed to small ball bowel movements for a year now. The colonoscopy was fine. I have been taking fiber and drinking about 8 glasses of water a day to see if this will improve my stools. So far the fiber has not helped. I have diabetes; type 2 and take Metformin and Glyburide. I also take Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure. I was drinking a soy powder drink for a year and stopped around the time I had the colonoscopy so my diet has changed. I no longer have the soy in my diet. I have heard the colonscopy prep liquid (I had ot drink a gallon of this) in some cases causes kidney disease. I am also concerned about this prep liquid and want to know if it can cause the small ball bowel movements (rabbit pellet type)? I am post-menopausal and quit taking my monthly birth control pills. The water I drink at work is hard water (perhaps a lot of lime in it). What should I do and what may have caused this? Also is the colonoscopy pre liquid to blame for this? Do I need to do a colon cleanse? How can I get my bowel movements back to normal size? Very scare and concerned.,2009,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 50 year old woman with Type 2 Diabetes; which is under control with diet and medication (Metformin 500mg 2x daily). I'm obese and have had numerous other health problems including IBS; Hypothyroidism; hx borderline Ovarian Cancer (prognosis for that is excellent); hx abdominal surgeries for hernias and hysterectomy; severe arthritis in spine and right knee; etc. For several years my left knee has been acting up off and on. I injured both knees within a week or each other after falling in '95. The right one is in bad shape - basically bone against bone - and cortisone shots didn't help; nor did those "flector" pads. My left knee can get screwed up rather quickly in that all it can take is to get out of the tub the wrong way or turn the wrong way; and ping - unbearable pain where I can hardly walk. That pain usually subsides after I've been walking for a little while. My left knee can act up for several days in a row and then be like nothing happened for a long time. This pain can be sporadic. The inside of my left ankle is quite swollen and there are times when that foot (or the other one) is very painful to step on. Sudden severe foot pain pops up when I least expect it. I was running errands yesterday morning and was getting ready to cross the street when my right foot got suddenly painful to the point where I had to pause. My left foot; however; can be very painful w/o walking and the toes can be numb at times. A few years ago (when I weighed less than I do now and did alot of walking) my feet would develop this "pins and needles" type sensation if I walked a long way. Anyway;. lately I noticed that sometimes my left leg will hurt from between my knee and ankle. The more I exercise; whether it be housework or just plain walking; it usually gets better. However; if I try to prop up that leg on my bed or chair; it can hurt like crazy. The pain seems to be worse after getting out of bed or having sat in a cramped position for a time. My car died last year; so I have to take the bus. If I'm stuck up front where there's little leg room; it can be very painful to get up and walk once I reach my stop. Could this be arthritis or something worse; like PAD? I don't have cardiovascular issues that I know of. I do see a cardiologist on a yearly basis for checkups because of my weight and family history of heart disease. Mom died of a massive heart attack in '99 at the age of 58. I have nuclear stress tests periodically and I passed each one with flying colors; the most recent one being this past May. My cholesterol has always been excellent; and my bp is usually good; although a few times in the past year they said it was borderline. No meds for that so far; just monitoring by my doctors. Thoughts; anyone? I'd hate to think that my arthritis has progressed to the point where I can barely walk. I have a sedentary lifestyle which I admit doesn't help. Because of my weight; arthritis and gut issues; there are times when I use those electric carts at the store. I felt better (pain-wise) when I was more active. I face the possibility of having weight loss surgery at the same time I'm going to have my latest hernia repaired; but that hasn't been decided yet. I would prefer to lose weight the old-fashioned way if possible like I did many years ago. At my heaviest I was well over 450. I'm nowhere near that now but have a long ways to go. Diana,2007,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,what effectiveness and safety do sam-E; NAC; milk thistle; choline have in treating NAFLD and anesthesia liver poisoning? I'm on large doses of these and my levels are almost normal; but I still don't have any appetite and feel nauseous after I take the supplements like milk thistle there seem to be some new studies that show that sam-E and vitamin E are good for liver diseases,2011,2013,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Why is it that sometimes my blood sugar levels rise after walking. First thing in the morning;about an hour after exercise and not eating anything my b/s level goes up by about 4-5 points.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have a couple of questions with a lot of history to help anyone who can answer (or suggest; lol). First; in October of last year; I thought I had a miscarriage. * I was more than 2 weeks late with my period (which is bang on one month plus one day [so if it was September 10th it would be October 11th the next time]). * I was experiencing a bit of nausea around 2:30 pm every day; a drop in my appetite; and a decrease in what was appetizing for me. I could only eat plain foods (e.g. cottage cheese and rice cakes) as opposed to anything with stronger flavors or spice (it would make me vomit). * My breasts were very sore; had a bit of discharge (whitish/yellow; very pale; no odor) and swollen - my bras were no longer fitting. * We had a positive stick test; and a negative blood test (stick test was taken the day before the blood test). * The day after the blood test; my "period" started. However; it came on very suddenly; lasted 10 days; with no relief in flow (very thick blood; heavy cramping and pain); whereas my normal periods are 3 days: 1 day spotting; 1 day light flow; 1 day spotting. They are usually pain free; with no side effects (except that I crave dark chocolate). My period didn't come back until December; and was exactly 2 months and 1 week "later" than my normal schedulae would be. That period was normal (3 day cycle). Since then it has been erratic; often more than 5 days later each month; and skipped in January (I had been in the ER right before Christmas due to the flu - they asked if I wanted a pregnancy test and I automatically said no; as it had been 3 months since we had "active"). A Bit of History: Right now; I am not on any birth control. I was put on BC for the first time in January of 2001 (I started my cycle at age 11; but it stopped at 13 and didn't come back until I was on the pill in 2001; when I was 21). I had been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes (oral medications) a month before; and after discussing birth control options with my GP; she put me on Ortho Tri-cyclen. I was on that without pause until 4 years ago; when I talked to my new GP (new city). I had major pain; cramps and stabbing pains during the week that I should have gotten my period (which was hit and miss; sometimes it would arrive sometimes not). My new doc put me on Alesse; to see if that would help with the pain. I was on it for 6 months; and still had the same pains; and opted to go without birth control. Within 3 months; my period was normal; I knew when to expect it; and it was the low-flow; pain-free cycle that I have had normally for the last 3 1/2 years. In October of 2006; I was put on insulin for my diabetes. I am currently in control of my blood sugars; and all is fine in that department (according to my bloodwork). I do not use condoms due to allergic reactions to latex and various chemicals. I am married; and we have been together for 5 years now. Hubby has survived cancer twice in his youth (he is 30 now). First he had Leukemia at age 3 or 4; and then cancer of the CNS around age 6-7. He had both radiation and chemotherapy. He hasn't had too many health issues in the last 10 years; other than Bipolar (possibly); depression and anxiety; and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (though we are looking into having this properly diagnosed; as our GP hasn't properly diagnosed this). I too suffer from clinical depresion; anxiety and PTSD; as well as IBS and possibly Fibromyalgia (I am also quite overweight). Alrighty; so my questions are this: My breasts are still tender and a bit swollen (though not nearly as they were in October); and my period is wonky. I'm gaining weight like crazy; right in front; in my abdomen area; to the point my pants aren't fitting properly. I'm hvaing lower back pain (not horrible; but enough that I notice). The last time my hubby and I were sexually active was September 13th (and it had been months before that). I'm also so gassy; to the point I'm embarassed to go out; lol! I've been on Dicetel for my IBS for a year now; and have had no problems since I started it (and no problems now). I've been getting acid reflux like crazy too; which is odd for me (I used to get it maybe once a year; and it would be a one night thing; usually after spicey food). My diet is very close to the same as it was a year ago - mainly vegetarian (not much tofu though); with chicken and fish once or twice a month. I avoid processed foods as much as possible; and prefer whole grains; fresh fruit and veggies; etc. We eat as healthy as possible within our budget. I have changed my sleep patterns; as I used to be a night owl; sleeping all day and rarely seeing the sun. Over the course of a month I've switched to going to bed by midnight; and waking by 9. We go for walks every few days; roughly 1 KM each time. The medications I am currently taking are: Insulin; Metformin; Seroquel; Lipitor; Dicetel along with a women's daily vitamin and folic acid (these are for the joint and muscle pain; as I've discovered that the pain is lessened when I take them and avoid most meats). So my questions are: is it possible that I didn't miscarry in October? I will be going for blood work soon; but I don't have too much confidence in it. Is it possible that the medications I am on could be responsible for the symptoms I have? And lastly; what can I do in the future to help have a healthy pregnancy (if it's even possible)? Thanks everyone; for reading and for anyone who can offer answers or advice :),2008,2008,28,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I am hoping that someone can help me understand my recent blood work in addition to symptoms. Should I be concerned and if so; what should I be asking the doctor? Symptoms: ~ Tired; Tired; Tired! I have been known to fall asleep on the couch at 6:30 pm; wake up at 11 pm just long enough to walk into my bed and collapse again. Wake up at 6:30 a.m. feeling like I never slept at all. Due to this; exercise has already been put on the back burner. ~ Memory Loss. I can be in the middle of a sentence and can't remember what I said or what I was going to say. The same goes for emails. I used to have a knack for names and now I can barely remember my own name. ~ It is hard to be kind to people. My emotions are up and down. ~ I am always cold. Everyone else can be in t-shirts and I'm bundled up with layers that include a jacket or sweatshirt...and normally at least 2 shirts under that. ~ Unexplained weight gain. I lost a significant amount of weight (60 lbs) a couple years ago. I have continued with my habits (minus the exercise as it seems that it takes me days to recover from a simple 30 min. workout). I was 4 lbs away from my goal when I started gaining weight last year.... and it just keeps piling on. In the last month I have gained 15 lbs. Currently; I have gained everything I lost plus some. ~ I have started to pull away from people (a friend noticed that I'm not myself and I would rather be by myself these days.) ~ Hair loss! This started in 2000 and I have had biopsy's completed that has identified that the "jackets" are coming out as well. ~ The last couple of times I have been to my primary physician; my resting heart rate was 60; which they said was "slow". ~ I have been on High Cholesterol medication since I was around 18 years old. No matter what I do I can't get my bad cholesterol low and my good cholesterol high. Other items to note: ~ I have PCOS ~ We have other auto immune diseases in my immediate family which includes Rheumatoid Arthritis; Diabetes; Guillain Barre; Thyroid; etc. ~ Prior TSH result was 9.11.13 @ 1.906. (same lab as the one below) ~ Only other time I have had T4 tested it was .95 (same lab as the one below - 10.27.08) ~ Only other time I have had TPO ab test it was 56 (same lab as the one below; noted as "High; but not affecting TSH 2.16" - 11.7.07). I was not experiencing as many symptoms at that point. Test Results: -Taken 3.13.15; Doctor failed to test for APO ab (Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies) even though she said she was going to TSH: 3.776 (0.4 - 4.0) - noted it was "high-normal" T3: 2.8 (2.3 - 4.2) - around 26%? T4: .97 (0.84 - 1.51) - around 19%? -Taken 4.23.15; Doctor hasn't been on top of things for a while and this time failed to test T3 & T4. TSH: 2.659 (0.4 - 4.0) TPO ab: 1782.5 (0 - 60) - Yes; my results are 1;782.5! I had to look at it 5 times before I trusted it. This is also noted with "positive for auto immune Thyroid disease" I contacted my doctor regarding the TPO ab results since I didn't receive a call but instead received the results through the mail. The medical assistant (who spoke with the doctor) said that they will not be starting me on anything as my TSH is normal. At some point my TSH will catch up with the Antibodies & symptoms and which point they will do something. She wasn't concerned that my TSH fluctuates that much during a one month time frame because "it fluctuates on a daily basis". As for the symptoms...I was just going to have to weather through them.....to be honest; I'm too tired to keep weathering through them. I'm thinking I need to go get a second opinion (and change doctors as there has been a lot of warning signs that she just isn't as well on top of my health as a endocrinologist should be). What kind of doctor should I be looking for? Another Endo? A Naturopath? What should I be asking? Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!,2015,2015,38,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 24 year old female. For the past month or so I feel starving all the time. It's the feeling of a gurgling stomach and intense; sickening gnawing hunger pain underneath the gurgling. It makes me immediately start sweating; I get hot and feel that I'll be sick (faint; throw up; etc.) if I don't eat immediately. I run into the kitchen and drink milk and eat oatmeal; peanut butter toast; etc. Sometimes eating makes the pain go away for for maybe an hour; but then the pain starts again; and sometimes eating doesn't make the pain go away at all. I can't sleep through the night. I wake up about every 1 to 2 hours with the pain; pounding heart; dizziness and sweating. I eat a granola bar and fall back asleep for a bit until I wake up with the same thing again. Mornings are horrible. When I wake up I feel dizzy; faint; hungry; and the gnawing hunger pain in my stomach. I've gained 10 pounds because I eat all the time; and I'm don't exercise anymore because of the pain and fear that I'll faint. Other issues I'm having are: excessive gas; bloating; burping up bile; diarrhea in the mornings and increased bowel movements. I also suffer from anxiety. When I start getting the hunger feeling I worry that my blood sugar is low and that sends me into an anxiety attack. The pain also sends me into an anxiety attack because it hurts so bad and I don't know what's going on. The lack of sleep; no exercise; weight gain; constant eating; and inability to go out are ruining my life and making my anxiety worse. I've been taking 40mg of Pepcid AC every day for a month and I don't think it's helping. For the past month I drank a Slim Fast every morning; and a month's worth of Slim Fast was just recalled because they might be contaminated with Bacillus Cereus. I thought maybe that was the problem; but I haven't had a Slim Fast in about a week and my problems remain. I don't know if the two things are related or just circumstantial.,2009,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My periods have almost always been sporadic; but I never missed more than two in a row. This past year; I noticed I'm skipping more often and when I skip; I get bad symptoms - it's like phantom PMS - for that month. August was especially bad (I skipped my period July and August) so I decided to go on the pill in September. I don't even know if I ovulated that month because I started the pill in the middle of the month. I guess it was denial for me because I was just so scared of missing 3 months in a row. Since I started on the pill mid Sept. I didn't get a chance to see if I'd get a period or not for that month; tho I had a feeling I was going to skip anyway. :( I'm actually feeling much worse on the pill. I want to see if it can help regulate things and it's supposed to help with cysts; if I have them. I had an ultrasound which showed several follicles on my left ovary; but my Dr. said he can't tell from this and wants to do more tests. I'm so scared that I have something wrong; if not PCOS than an imbalance; and my periods will just get worse when I go of fthe pill. I only want to be on it for a few months. Is it more than likely my periods will get more and more sporadic? I don't know if I have PCOS but does it really matter? I have something wrong. Every month I don't ovulate I just get so sad. I know ovulation makes women more attractive to men; and I don't have that. I've had depression and been on anti-depressants for 2 years. It could partly be related to the the irregular periods I've had since age 18. I never minded; but now it's more common for me to skip 1 and 2 in a row (I'm 28); and when I do I get the breakouts; anxiety; moodiness. The pill was supposed to help; but I'm feeling upset all the time. I just want to be a regular woman and it's not fair. Nothing is working in life but I at least felt like I was attractive and knowing how ovulation is a big part of that... it makes me feel like I'm going through menopause to not have this. I really feel like I'll commit suicide if it gets much worse; if I go in next month and get tests ran that come out badly. I was just in shock in my initial appt. with the ob-gyn because my ultrasound came in mail marked "satisfactory." Now to hear that I could have PCOS and just having to wait until I go off this terrible pill (which I will next month becuase I can't STAND synthetic hormones in my body) to see if my cycles will regulate or get even more messed up. Please tell me that this isn't just going to get worse. I can deal with missing two cycles in a row; but to miss more than that. I might as well not be alive because it's an unreal thing to have to go through at 28 years old. :(,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I cook very healthy (bake or broil) for both my husband & myself. I have cooked healthy since we found out my grandpa had many many things wrong with him (diabetes; gout; high blood pressure; stomach issues; you name it-he had it) because my grandma cooked Hungarian style. For the past month (since approx 03/20/09) I have had stomach issues: nausea/vomiting; very soft stool/diarhea; migraines; extremely severe lower abdominal pain; extremely severe gas. (The gas & soft stool has been extremely toxic) which I have never experienced before until the past month. I waited to go to a gastrologist because I didn't have the money for the copay. I was just informed that urine & stool came out normal. If everything is normal; then what is wrong with me. All of this very painful. EVERYTHING I eat goes through me anywhwere from 20 minutes to 1 hr. I can't go anywhere or do anything except sit on the toilet & throw up with a small trashcan on my lap. When I have errands to run; groceries; etc I can't eat until I come home and being diabetic isn't good for me not to eat something. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. This is beginning to get me real depressed and I'm not a depressing person. I try to keep my spirits up. This is worse than my chemo treatments last year. MCV in Richmond; VA called it a liquid chemo for HEPC. I was on a 48 week Interferon & Ribiviron (spelling?) treatment. I am 98% cured. I contracted HEPC in the late 1970's from a required emergency blood transfusion. It laid dormant for over 30 years and the doctors said the diabetes probably brought it out. Red count cells went down to 8.2 at one time. Everything else seems normal; excellent heart; EKG; etc. BUT now I have this extremely severe and very painful stomach issue. Please help me try to figure out what this could be. I am scheduled for an Endoscopy & Colonoscopy on April 30th. My husband's insurance ***** and medical costs and copays are too expensive for us; since he is the only one working right now. INSURANCE INCREASES IN JUNE 2009. Just today I experienced a slither of stool. I don't usually look at my poop; but did today. It was the color of orange; like a neon orange; with a slight hint of yellow.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Are using the HCG Injections connected to hair loss? I finished a 2 month round of injections in June during which time I lost 15 pounds. However; during the past months (Sept/Oct) I noticed that I am having substantial hair loss. Every morning I brush out lots of hair and the texture of my hair has changed. I have stopped shampooing every day and just water rinse my hair every other day; but the hair loss continues. Has anyone had hair loss after going off HCG? If so; does the body begin to adjust and new hair grow back or is the hair gone forever? This is really a bad side effect if it is related to using HCG. HELP does anyone have any experience or recommendation on this. The only other factor that has changed in the past three months is that my Doctor started me on 1000 MG daily of Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes. Could this have caused the change in hair? Or could it be the combination? HELP; who wants to be slim--but bald? I would love to hear from all of you! Thanks. Lucy,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,2 nights ago while working my right lower leg; on the outside part started swelling along with my whole foot. I have had no injuries. I do smoke; I take lisinopril for blood pressure; I take metformin for type 2 diabetes along with Lovasa and Niacin for triglycerides. I have been diagnosed with CAD. I went home thinking I had just had too much salt or sat wrong or something. The sweeling was down a little in the morning but I had a dull ache on the outside of my shin bone in that muscle. Went to work that night and the swelling came back to the point I had to take my shoe off; the swelling was pretty bad; the skin looked like it had been polished it was so shiny. Boss offered to let me go home but it didn't hurt so I stayed. I sit when I'm at work so didn't think I could do much damage while sitting. Went home the next morning the swelling was down again but the muscle seemed like it was bulging or swollen on the outerside next to the shin bone. I'm at work again and the swelling is coming back and there is an achy feeling in the outside lower half of my leg. My co worker says I should go to ER because it sounds like a blood clot; but I dont' know anything about that and not sure if this is a good reason for an ER visit. What do you think?,2009,2011,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,can anone tell me are these readings normal total cholesterol 160 mg/dl LDL cholesterol 103 mg/dl HDL cholesterol 39 mg/dl triglycerides 91 if not how can i improve,2010,2011,18,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed type 2 at 34. I was gestational with both my pregnancies too. I was never able to diet control. At the time I was diagnosed I was working out an hour a day; was very active working on the farm and was eating a fairly good diet. In response to my diagnosis; I lost 20 lbs and cut out fruit juice and some of the grains in my diet. This worked for all these years. I developed some health problem over the last couple of years and noticed my FBS went from being about 110 to being more like 125.My 2 hour PP readings were still under 165 until the last 6 months or so. After working with various drs. we figured out that my exhaustion was coming from anemia; my thyroid is doing something abnormal but they aren't sure what. I have been on synthroid since I was 12 and am currently not on any because my levels seem to have stabilized somewhat. My anemia stemmed from female issues which resulted in a hysterectomy a couple months ago. So now that I'm feeling somewhat better I wanted to tackle the elevated BS problem. I was hoping that they hysterectomy would take care of it (when you feel awful your BS tends to be high). No such luck. If anything; my BS is higher than before surgery (I still have ovaries but there seems to have been a reduction in estrogen; not that it's gone but I think I had too much before). So today; I decided that I would not eat carbs except for what was in meat and veggies. I haven't even had any fruit although I did have a 1/4 cup of 1% milk in my morning coffee. My readings today are not so hot. FSB 129. 2 hr pp 152. 3 hr pp 110. Pre lunch 111. About 1.25 hr after lunch 157. My breakfast contained 4 carbs. My lunch contained 11. It seems my after meal jump shouldn't be happening. I know to many; 11 is a lot of carbs but all I ate was some lean ham stir fried with about 2 cups of assorted non starchy veggies. I currently take 500 mg Metformin after breakfast; after lunch; and before bed. My FSB has been high but a couple days ago I read something on another board that said try adding a higher fat snack like cheese or peanut butter shortly before bedtime to prevent your liver from dumping glucose in the early morning. Since high FSB has always been a problem I thought I would try it. It seems to be helping; just not enough. Do I just need to persist on this really low carb diet to try to flush out extra carbs or is it just time for an increase in my Met? I don't know that I can learn to eat like this. I have watched my carbs for years but always have included things like a slice of whole wheat bread; noodles; potatoes and a little rice. And yeah; that periodic cookie or piece of candy.,2012,2012,46,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am very much wanting some sort of medical advice... I had an abnormal pelvic exam Thurs. (pain on Right side with palpation) during exam & was sent for pelvic & TV U/S. The results show: 2.1 x 1.9 x 2.4cm complex cystic lesion IN right ovary with thick septations with a focal echogenic area. No abnormal fluid around R ovary. Ovary measuring 4 x 2.6 x 4cm. Left ovary showed "multiple" follicular cysts. We did not even think we were finished having children & this is very heart-wrenching; thinking I could be infertile. Also; to think this R ovary could possibly be cancerous????? The impression stated that the differential diagnosis includes dermoid cyst; cystadenoma; or even cystadenocarcinoma. Radiologist also recomm. laparoscopy. Sounds like I am going to lose my ovaries? or can they take a cyst from INSIDE the overy without damaging it? Is this possibly life-threatening or in need of chemo? Very worried. We just moved & have no family here & 5 & 7 yr. olds to care for. Anxiously awaiting some sort of info. P.S. Brand new OB for me as we just moved here 4 mos. ago & she never even called me back when I paged her yesterday afternoon. Info? Please...thank you,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Brand new to site and new to detailed Thyroid info. labs out of range/ratio. Very confused. Help please! History: diagnosed LADA (T1 diabetes) 3 years ago. On insulin and metformin. Started thyroid meds about same time. Currently on Tirosint 88 and have been on this amt for over 1 yr. Recent past FT3 labs (two separate testings over the last month or so) came back: 2.2 L (Range 2.3-4.2) with TSH .875 (Range: .350-5.500) Dr. prescribed 5 cytomel without much more info. Started some reading re thyroid. Did not start cytomel as I wanted additional testing. So... Redid FT3 test again with additional tests last week. These most recent labs came back as follows: TSH: 0.337 L (Range .350-5.500) FT4: 1.65 (Range: .89-1.76) FT3: 2.4 (Range: 2.3-4.2) Anti-TG <20 (Range <41) TPO 33 (Range <61) Thyroglobulin (TG) 2.4 (Range: <55) RT3: 443 H (Range: 90-350) Iron Serum: 67 (Range:30-170) TIBC: 284 (Range: 250-450) Ferritin: 48 (Range: 10-291) Vit B12: 1219 H (Range: 211-911) Vit D 25: 50.5 (Range: 30-100) What does all this mean--the very high RT3 and Vit B!2; especially? My Dr. keeps saying I have Hashi's; but do the labs indicate this? interpretation and some direction would be so appreciated!! Thank you!,2015,2015,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I recently got my blood tests back and am not sure if I have "Heart Disease" in the classical meaning of the phrase or just a bad reading or "Bad Numbers" which need to be addressed. Can someone please clarify this for me? First off; I'm a recently turned 60 year old man who used to be an athletic type during my younger years and over the years let it all go down the drain it seems. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 almost exactly 2 years ago; and also hypertension for the first time. Although my Hypertension was on the low side then the Dr. Still prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg a day for me which I have taken until recently (he upped it my last visit to 40 mg a day predicated on my own readings showing that 20 mg was not enough (he said that even if there was some disparity that 40 mg a day "wouldn't hurt me' or lower my blood pressure any further and it was ok-and even said I could break the tablets in half after 20 mg and take 10 followed with 10 later if my blood pressure went up again. At that time; 2 years ago he also prescribed 500 Mg of Metformin to be taken twice daily which I have followed to the letter since then; plus 40 mg of Simvastatin or Zocor once a day. I cut the Simvastatin out back in December after having experienced the worst vertigo episode one could imagine-cat scan Dr. ordered at the ER showed no problem like stroke-but the reoccurrence of the vertigo and he prescribed it to probably an inner ear infection or something in that nature. I was prescribed Meclizine for the vertigo if it came back again; which it did (he called it positional vertigo as one position stopped the terrible spinning of the world around me-and the med with some valium did the job..until the next and then the next episode days apart. Then I got on the internet and saw all the horror stories and similar symptoms that Simvastatin caused and stopped taking immediately-Dr. or no Dr’s advice. The vertigo disappeared the next day until 4 months later where I’m back in the ER again and again CAT scan showed ok-but ER Dr. said I did a good thing by eliminating the Simvastatin; citing other problems it could cause besides vertigo down the road. So I took Simvastatin for only 1 ½ years-until the symptoms showed up. My Dr. who is a heart specialist and has been around for a long time was given the ER results and after putting off my visit to him for a long time (ok I don’t like going to the doctor!) realized I needed blood tests done as I was feeling; and still am feeling; absolutely miserable. The results are as follows-just under 2 weeks ago-total cholesterol 199-not bad as it has been worse in the past..but he said my “now” cholesterol reading was not good-somewhere around 274 or 279-my HDL is 25 (has always been bad and fluctuated over the years-highest 38 and never reached that 40 number in this decade); Triglycerides 505 (was over 700 2 years before; got it down with walking and exercise and a fish oil prescription called Lovazo to 180-then back to my unhealthy ways-lot of stress-death in the family and so on-did not help as I have stayed home and secluded for 10 months now-and probably why my vitamin D count according to the Dr. is very very low at 11.6) VLDL is 101; Dr. guesstimates my LDL is around the 140 area due to improper calculation because of high triglycerides; Glucose serum is 116 but the Dr. said because my A1c is 5.4 that’s good as the Metformin is working as it should be. The Dr. made the following changes in my prescription-he finally gave in to my saying that I would NOT take impastation again and prescribed Niaspan 500-wants me to take twice daily if the (“side affects“) improve (improve? “Fahget bout it!”) in a week or so. I read what the side effects are on Niaspan and they are not good at all and I don’t need to go through all that now. He was about to add a new statin to that until he realized that he was giving me too much all at once-as he said later. New Statin down the road (A big Maybe on that one)? I am going to do exactly what I did the last time 2 years ago-sans the impastation-take fish oil omega 3 over the counter-the Dr. said that was ok as long as it did not exceed 4 grams per day-similar to Lovazo-walk and walk and walk; which I did the last time and my lipid results improved dramatically going from about 220 total cholesterol to 167 and my triglycerides dropping from a whopping over 700 to 180 and my HDL going from 27 to 34-some improvement anyway-all in 6 weeks. Then I will tell him I didn’t take the Niaspan (which I believe he suspects I will not take anyway); and after the blood tests see where I am. During the 2 years I had a cat scan done to check on a suspected nodular opacity which was not there as shown incorrectly on the exray (with contrast and one reason I don’t need to go through that horrible toasted sensation all over my body which Niaspan causes plus other side affects). I know this was a long story but since I have not spoken about this and seen the Dr. very rarely in the past 2 years I felt I needed to tell all to the experts on here or people that I consider experts with their vast experience judging from the posts as compared to my limited experience. I’m 5’9 and approx 224 lbs. by the way-and that’s the first thing that is going to go-if I don’t get a heart attack first! Seriously though; wondering if I have “Heart Disease” in the classical meaning of the word (Never asked my Dr. and he’s a bit evasive on such direct questions anyway). Anybody care to help please let me know what you think. I am contributing my 199 total cholesterol to eating a lot healthier these past several months but don’t know what that “now cholesterol” that the Dr. talked about is-as that seemed to be of some concern to him. One last thing-my Dr. made me feel great before I left his office when I asked him what my chances of getting a heart attack were now and he should me this rectangular plastic thing where I saw little lego miniature type blocks-very little and then this block as big as the Washington Monument next to them (that’s me he said insofar as my chances of getting a heart attack) and a slightly taller lego type next to that. Boy I needed that! He did say-”Keep walking” as I was leaving his office which was encouraging of course.,2010,2010,59,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,So I failed my 1 hour glucose test with a 217! I'm really wondering if it had something to do with what I ate this weekend. I had an abnormally high amount of carbs (biscuits; breads; etc.) and sugar (sherbert; donuts). I was out of town and being cooked for so I wasn't able to watch what went in things. I am on metformin 1000 milligrams ER. I go back next week for the 3 hour test. What are my chances of passing with a low carb and high protein diet with a number that high? Is there anything else I can do to avoid failing?,2008,2011,27,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just got the results of my Nuclear Stress Test conducted chemically at the VA Hosp in Charleston; SC. I was looking forward to maybe finding out why my pulse rate has always been so high; especially in the last few years. The night before the test I measured 120 while rested and at rest using an automatic blood pressure checker. I just got the letter with results and it is Greek to me. It says my Nuclear Stress test was normal; Myocardial perfusion scan with no evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. The left wall motion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated to be 54%.... Two questions. How does 54% rate for a man 70 years old with emphysema. Also; I wad determined to try and find out why my pulse is so high and what can be done about it; if anything. Furthermore; I secretly hoped maybe I needed a valve or stint or something that might be impairing blood flow. If nothing is 'fixable' with my circulatory system I am stuck with it all being my lungs which are less apt to ever get any improvement. aI am overweight mostly from having no energy or breath needed to exercise. Just shopping without an electric cart is almost beyond reach. I also have minor diabetes and using Meformin 500 mg; no shots; and do not take any type of meds with narcotics of any kind that would elevate my pulse.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,About 8 weeks ago my husband (71) developed movement on the right side of his body; especially with the right hand and fingers. Some twiching also developed in his right leg and shoulder. This "chorea" movement is fluid and ceases when he is asleep. He was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol. At the time he weighed 285 (5'11"). Our family physician prescribed Metformin and Pravastatin. Blood sugar levels (previously over 300) and blood pressure have come down to low levels. His neurologist suggested a Huntington's Disease test but the test came back negative. The neurologist prescribed Haldol to help with the tremors. The neurologist ordered a brain MRI which revealed a spot in the basal ganglia; however; without knowing if this spot happened recently or several years ago (my husband has never been to a doctor; always been healthy until now); the neurologist is not sure what my husband has. He suggested another MRI in about 3 months. My husband weighs 220 pounds now. His twitching has increased; along with other symptoms: anxiety; crushing depression; inability to concentrate on reading newspapers and following TV programs. He also has lost his ability to taste food. He even has lost his interest in following sports (his favorite pass time). Can someone help me help the doctors?,2008,2008,54,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have two things going on: 1. I have a small (dime-size) lump on the right side of my neck. It is even with my ear near the base of my neck. I have had it for approx. 3 years. It is definitely someone in my neck vs. related to my skin as my skin appears normal. It doesn't hurt and it doesn't move. In fact it doesn't bother me at all and I've never really been concerned about it until a friend urged me to get it checked out. 2. My right thigh - depending on how I walk; how I sit; etc. - has a burning pain periodically. I also experience numbness - all localized on the outside of my right thigh. I am overweight; so am not sure if that is a cause - but there is no numbness in my feet or hands; or even my arms or left thigh - it is very much right thigh specific. I'll also throw out there that I've been a little tired lately. And had some aching all over - almost like "growing pains" when I was a kid - the same kind of sudden pain somewhere that goes as fast as it comes. Mostly in my limbs. So I'm not sure what this could be... well; I have some not very positive thoughts that are driving me crazy right now. So any thoughts on that it might be; tests to request from my doctor (I have an appt next week); anything to calm me down from obsessing all weekend or preparing me for what I might have to deal with next week would be very much appreciated. Thanks!,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Reading the ClinicCare article on Steatosis found this interesting.... weighing more than 85 kg who were treated with 270 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a were found to have higher serum trough concentrations of the drug and a higher overall SVR rate.[56;57] Further investigation is under way to assess the efficacy of higher fixed doses of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in obese patients. Wondering if us chubbs have doctors aware of this... ...Finally; obesity can contribute to fibrosis progression by impairing response to interferon-based therapy. This may occur in part because obesity reduces the bioavailability of interferon. Conventional and peginterferons are injected subcutaneously and preferentially taken up by the lymphatic system. Patients with large amounts of subcutaneous fat may have impaired absorption of the drug because of decreased lymphatic uptake.[55] Although the 2 available types of peginterferon alfa are dosed differently (peginterferon alfa-2a is administered at a fixed dose of 180 μg; whereas peginterferon alfa-2b is dosed at 1.5 μg per kilogram of body weight); the maximum recommended weekly doses are 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a and 150 μg of peginterferon alfa-2b. Patients weighing more than 100 kg may therefore receive a suboptimal dose of peginterferon alfa-2b if dosed according to guidelines. Recent data suggest that 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a may also be insufficient for heavier patients.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dr. Lupo; Thank you for your response and assistance. I greatly appreciate it. I am scheduled for another recheck for the TSH in May. I will also ask for a retest for the T4. However; my T3 level was never tested. When I requested; my Dr. said something to the effect that the T3 doesn't matter. I did receive a call from the Dr.'s office today telling me that my second set of antibodies test shows I have Hoshimoto's Disease and I have another appointment on Friday to discuss options with my Dr. I'm still wondering if a ultrasound shows no nodule's is there a need for a thyroid scan? and if it's dangerous to the thyroid to have the iodine or radiation medicine injected? Hoping you can respond before I go to the Dr.'s on Friday. Thank You for taking the time and reviewing and answering my postings.,2012,2012,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Why would a doctor not give me a straight up answer about ACTOS? 2nd question: Why would someone who has blood sugar readings of anywhere from 98 to 126 be put on Metformin prior this ACTOS? Is it normal to be much worse off after starting any medication? I used to have such wonderful control upon my own and taking my walks before starting all this "treatment." I am so confused that when I ask my physician whether or not ACTOS causes weight gain; she answered; "No; it does not. It causes weight loss!" Jiminy crickets! And all over the net various patients are complaining about rapid weight gain. The worst report was a lady who had lost a LOT of weight like I have; and she gained 45 pounds within 3 months when placed on ACTOS. I also had the precursor to diabetes type II (PCOD) and I cannot afford to gain weight. I have lost a whole person off my body and it took me 12 years!!!! I already take Metformin; and am still dealing with the fallout from taking it (slight kidney difficulties--kidney stones; diarrhea; nausea. I have been on Metformin alone for 2 years. As soon as I read these instances of side ACTOS side effects; I was so frustrated and disheartened; that I cannot get a straight and honest answer from someone who is supposed to have my BEST interests at heart. I gain weight at the drop of a hat. I still have about 40 more pounds to go. I cannot afford such setbacks. The only reason my blood sugars arose to 140 was because I control it with exercise; and it is HOT here in Texas. The treadmill isn't the same as propelling my full body weight down a path in the park!!!!! I am AFRAID now to take ACTOS--more so because I don't believe that I was given an honest answer. THe hot weather cannot last forever; and my walks really truly control the sugar when I am able to do them. Even the pharmacist said that it causes swelling (edema). Not to mention I have mitral valve heart damage; and the kidney stone thing going on; and from what I was reading from the pharmaceutical company; it was not recommended that people with heart trouble and kidney trouble take ACTOS. So you can see my frustration and fear?,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For several months I've been having a general ill feeling. Within the last 2 months it's gone from just feeling tired after a full night sleep to dizziness; fatigue; and nausea spells that come out of nowhere every day (my blood sugar is good; so it's not that). In February I started seeing a new doctor who decided to do a CBC just to check everything because my PCOS was "flaring up" again and causing unexplained bleeding. What came back was a WBC count of 17.1 and my HCT was low; I now have a vitamin D deficiency (which isn't rare; but it's annoying). I also had a very high blood pressure for the first time in my life; despite being overweight my blood pressure is usually normal. She decided to send me to a Hematologist who ran some tests but due to health insurance I wasn't able to follow up right away. Two weeks ago I finally followed up with my hematologist and he ran more tests and suggest that I get a bone marrow biopsy. I'm scheduled to get it done this Friday; but I'm wondering what he may be testing for? He wasn't very specific. A few of my recent test results came back either below or above average; and that may give an idea of what's going on; but I'm having a hard time understanding what it all may mean. I've been doing the one thing I shouldn't - reading everything online. A lot of what I read points to an autoimmune disease or something; so I'm just trying to get a few opinions. These are the test results that came back "weird": WBC 14.5 HCT 35.5 NU#(ANC) 10.1 Iron; % saturation 10.4 Reticulocyte count 2.0 Alpha-1 blobulin 0.5 Beta globulin 1.4 ESR 61 Maybe I'm just overreacting; but any opinions would be appreciated.,2014,2014,24,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am diabetic since 1998; at the time I discovered that I am diabetic the blood level was 450 mg/dl and ketone bodies were +4 out of 5. I managed to lower it within one week with tablets to 130 mg/dl and adopting 0 carb intake; I was obese (160 kg); I lost weight and brought my weight down to 95 kg within 6 months by diet only the famous 0 carb diet and got my hypertension from 160/110 to 110/70 (mm Hg). I kept measuring Fbg and Blood pressure and always found them at 75 mg/dl for fbg and 110/70 for blood tension. till I was conveinced that my pancreas was regenerated and I returned cautiously to normal food and I gained weight. Last year I experienced polyurea and I consulted my Doctor who thought that it is related to my prostate since I am already 58 yrs. I checked my urine sugar before 6 weeks and found 3% sugar excreted in urine ( according to Roche TM urine sugar test stripes. and my FBG 330 mg/dl. my blood pressure 160/110 mg/dl I went to my Doctor and gave me glucophage and I returned to my previous diet and I have a 0 urine sugar level blood pressure 140 /93 mmHg . but my Fbg becomes highest in the morning and lowest at bed time 260 FBG morning and 180 mg/dl at bed time. ( I am on 0 carb diet and I lost so far 10 kgs of my weight. Would you please explain to me why my Fbg is high and bedtime is normal thanks roger jansbick I,2007,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I guess I should start by saying I am new here..and I have this dilemna. I feel like **** all the time. Dry; patchy scaly skin; headaches; I dont sleep very well; I am tired all the time not near the energy I had before the surgery. I have almost lost all of my sex drive. I get hot then cold; and it seems like I am forgetting things...even at my job..and that cannot happen. I got my T4 free results: 1.4 TSH 0.434. Dr. says normal. the numbers are normal....but why am I gaining weight (20 pounds). It seems like daily. And why do I feel the way I feel if everything is normal? I have had a hysterectomy 17 yrs ago; that would explain some bloating maybe; and all the weight I gain is right in the middle of my belly...I am starting to look 5 months preggers....This is so NOT fun. Being that I had my thyroid removed 8 months ago; I am currently on Levothyroxine (0.125 mg). I also have type 2 diabetes; insulin dependent. I take 35 units of Lantus at night. I take Novolog on a sliding scale using 2 units per carb. My blood sugars are in control. I take Lisinopril 40mg. I take Amlodipine 5 mg. I have gained weight and cannot lose any. It is as if I have a tube in my belly pumping air in. I do treadmill ; ablounge and pilates 4 days a week. I have even changed the way I eat because of this weight issue.,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Well…I got my 4 week PCR results back today and I only got a one log drop from 848;000 to 38;600. To be honest; I thought RVR was a long shot considering my stats going in; but with the amped up doses; I really thought I’d see more of a drop. So now instead of decreasing the Pegasys down to 1 ½ doses a week; I am to stay at the full 360 mcg a week and stay at 1400 Riba until the 12 week mark and then extend SOC to 72 weeks. I’m almost too disheartened to cry right now; but I’m sure the tears will come at some point. I still wonder if I am getting enough…what do you call it? Saturation? with the Riba even at 1400 mg since my hgb is hard pressed to budge downward. But the thought of upping it to 1600 makes me almost physically ill; not that it’s been recommended. So what do you do? Cuss and cry it out for a day then start putting one foot in front of the other again. I mean; what else can you do? I want to clear; but I don’t want to nuke myself in the doing…… So I’ll give myself another jab tonite and hopefully kill off a few more of those buggers; Any suggestions of anything more I could try; even if it's outside the norm?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in June 2008. During the year prior to the diagnosis; I went from a weight of 115-118 lbs to 140-145 lbs. During that time; I was also diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency and started on shots. My initial TSH result was 55.54 in June 2008 and I was put on 100 mcg synthroid daily. In mid Sep 2008; my TSH was again tested and result was 0.03 and my synthroid was dropped to 88 mcg daily. For well over a year; I have been on a diet (approx 1000-1200 calories/day) focusing on vegetables; fruits and whole grains. I work out for at least 30 minutes/day; as well as having a job which requires a large amount of exercise (mostly walking). In spite of my diet and exercise; my weight had stayed right around 145; but recently has begun to creep up again - it's now 149. I have talked to my doctor; but have not been given any ideas as to what might still be the problem. Is there something else that we should be looking for that could be causing this? Can you give some ideas of things that might help me lose the excess weight. Since I've never carried this much weight before; it's beginning to affect my feet and knees. Thank you,2008,2008,58,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; Diagnosed with variable blood pressure. If I take my BP while seated or reclined - after relaxing; it is always hypotension (ie 68/40; 56/38)It gets even lower at night. If I've just walked in to do so; without relaxing first it always quite high (ie 168/135; 172/139) and takes a long while to come down. Given HCTZ (25mgs) for hypertension. Unable to tolerate Ace Inhibitor (Altace) and Beta Blocker (Inderal). (I take thyroid replacement hormone for hypothyroid and Inderal blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 hormone. The Altace raised creatinine levels). Being hypothyroid I really have to be vigilent about exercise; or the weight piles on. But; I'm really nervous about exercising now that I have this wonky BP. I always thought with hypertension a person's BP was up ALL the time. Are these kinds of WILD swings; common? Should I be limiting activity? I really don't have to do a lot to really raise it from hypotension to hypertension-just walk across the room - so what will exercise do to it? What causes such wide swings? I've struggled to finally get the hypothyroid meds optimized and within range; and I feel pretty good. Now I find out I have this weird BP thing too. What hypertension meds will not interfer with thyroid meds? Would you recommend a stronger diuretic (furosimide)? Does furosimide interfer with thyroid hormone replacement? Is there a hypertension med you'd recommend? Can thyroid CAUSE this variable BP problem? Can thyroid meds cause it? Should I be as scared as I am that my BP is all over the map? Thanks so much! little0ne,2002,2002,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have type 2 diabetes; and take metformin; gabapentin; and simvastatin How often should i be testing my blood glucose? This discussion is related to upper leg pain and lower back pain.,2009,2009,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Yesterday I spent several hours; running errands. I stopped for a hamburger and diet drink while on the go. When I got home about 2 hours later; I had an upset stomach; body aches; and flushed cheeks. I felt sick and thought I had a fever. But; when I took my temp. it was only 91.4; using a digital thermometer under the tongue. (My temp. usually runs around 96.8.) I took 2 Tums and 2Acetaminophen (550 mg each). About an hour later my temp went up to 94.2; then dropped back down to 92.8 later. I have Type 2 diabetes (and for got to take my metformin in the morning). I had a vaccine shot for hepatitis years ago. This has happened before but not often; and not this extreme. My DR. recently did a thyroid check which came back in the low normal range. What could be causing this??,2014,2014,68,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a Bipolar 2 person with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes and am on tons of meds including lamictal; wellbutrin; concerta; altace & metformin. Recently I have experienced heart palpitations on an increasing frequency. First it started when I began taking my 2nd 18mg concerta (I take 2 18mg daily). I had palps maybe once or twice a week for 1-2 hours around the same time every day (3-5 hours after taking morning meds). This past week I began to experience it everyday 3-4 hours after morning meds; lasting from 1-3 hours. Finally; I had a day where I was really tired and didn't feel well and the palps started at my usual time and lasted 9 hours. I went to the hospital where they did ECGs; xray and a multitude of blood work. The palps showed on the ECG as well as on the monitors; my blood pressure was around 150/105. Then they suddenly stopped and my blood pressure went down. The doctor said they could ind nothing heart related wrong and I was told I had premature ventricular fibrillations; which are not uncommon or serious. However; they are EXTREMELY uncomfortable and cause shortness of breath and are not going away. I am on a Holter monitor for 24 hours and my doctor prescribed 25mg of atenolol to help stop the palpitations. I feel as if my medications may be the root of the problem; specifically the Concerta. Does it take time for meds to build up in your system and can cause the irregular heart beat problem? I would rather go off concerta than add yet another drug to the mix. Any thoughts on this? The palpitations are becoming a big problem for me.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Okay; first off I know that no one here can actually DX me and that is okay. I'm just looking for support I guess. With that being said; I am a 26yo male in a good health for the most part. I am overweight and have had blood test done cause I was feeling very shakey and always tired and the blood tests showed I have insulin resistance so the Dr gave me Metformin XR to take to help with that while i lose some weight. I'm not diebetic...YET and hopefully I won't get there. Anyway. this whole thing started about a few months ago. I noticed both of my legs felt a little odd and my arms did too; they felt like they were weak but when I would stand on them and use them they didnt seem weak at all but they did tremble a little bit when i would use them but never had any problems lifting or anything like that; yet i still felt like something was wrong with me. I just felt very fatigued overall and slept a lot. This feeling lasted for about a month and then went away completely just as my Mother and I went on vacation. I was thinking it might be stress cause my home life is VERY stressful. I'm worried about my future and my life ingeneral and how I'll get by; normal worries i guess everyone has; but i've always taken things way worse than most people. I tend to dwell on things. So; I was gone on vacation for about a week down south and I had no problems at all. NOTHING. Then shortly after I got back I started to get these little twitches in my arms and legs but its mostly on my left side. They're very minor but i can feel them and they last a few second then go away for hours or even a day or two then come back for a little bit. They seem to go away when i use my muscles and walk around or use my arms. But; if I sit down or lay down for a bit they MAY come back; not always. Then about 2 weeks of it; it all went away again then one week later I started to feel the twitching again. It's still on my left side. My arm and leg. the twitching in my leg is always these 2 spots. One in the back of my caff and the other on the side of my thigh. The twitching in my arm is random but isnt there so much as my leg. And of course the tiredness and wanting to sleep it back but its not every day i feel tired. Lately I've noticed other places in my body twitching like my buttox and my left hip side. Weird huh? Every since this started I've been googling the symptoms over and over and driving myself totally insane. I've read up about all the symptoms of MS and I only have 2 of the huge list of symptoms that are normally associated with MS. I've never any vision problems; no falling no loss of balance ever. No family history of MS. No pain; no sensitiveity to heat... nothing but the randomly twitching muscles and being tired off and on. I wonder if maybe this is all stress anxity and depression and the worrying is just caused by my brain which makes the symptoms worse. My mother is a R.N. and says that it is all in my head and that I'm acting nuts. This worrying about my health has destroyed my social life. I use to be the person who would always wanna go out and have fun and I did go 2 a week but that has stopped completely. I dont' feel like going out; i dont even feel like answering the phone when my friend call and they're pretty much stopped calling me now and moved on. I don't feel like even leaving my room sometimes. I'll just stay on my computer and my games and talk to a couple online friends and that's pretty much my life right now. I don't feel like doing anything unless I feel 100% good; if there is even ONe tiny little thing i feel then i dwell on it and it ruins my whole day. I really need help and answers. Does this sound like something or is it just normal and my brain is making me think it's abnormal. Thank you... Ever since this started ive bee,2009,2009,25,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,About four weeks ago my wife suffered a stroke when she was taken off life support. I believe it was to the left side of the brain because her right leg and arm were totally dead; she couldn't feel them at all. Even when a doctor put a pin to her foot there was no reaction at all. Her speech was a mess and the right side of her face dropped. She is 38 years old. After being at home for two weeks I have been trying my best to get her as back to normal as possible but to be honest I'm going nuts because I don't really know what therapy to use. So far I have managed to get her walking with a frame and her right leg is able to support her weight with a bit of a wobble. Her foot is ticklish now. Her right arm is moving but much weaker than the left one. She is able to do knitting; but there isn't enough strength in her fingers to cut her food with a knife. Her speech is totally back to normal and her face is symetrical again with no droop at all. Is this good progress over a two week period or should there be much more improvement? Doctors have told me that once the deadline of one year is reached; that's it; there's no more improvement. Is that true? I find it hard to believe. I would really appreciate some ideas on the type of exercises I should encourage her to do for building up her strength. I think the feeling is all there; it's just the weakness now. She can move each finger individually and co-ordinate her arm/hand to grab objects. She just seems confused as to how hard to grasp them. Any help is appreciated.,2009,2009,47,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I need some expert advise on my father's health. He was perfectly alright until October 2010 until he was hospitalized. I need your expert advise for that. He was hospitalized for a week and he was under cardiac surviellance for a week under which he went through ECG; Echocardiogram; Angiogram; and Stress Thallium Test (after 15 days of discharge from Hospital). His stress thallium states as follows: Patient is a case of CAD; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes mellitus with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Recent CAG shows 70% mid and distal LAD stenosis; 50%om2; and 60-70% RCA lesion. Stress MPI scan is being done to evaluate for reversible ischaemia. The LV cavity appears dilated at both stress and rest. Stress SPECT images reofmrate din the short and long axes shows an area of moderate perfusion defect invoving the Apex; apicoseptal and apicoanterior segments and inferior wall of the LV myocardium which shows mild reperfusion in the resting images. Tracer distribution in rest of the left ventricular myocardium is within normal physiological limits at both stress and rest. Quantification using the emory cardiac toolbox shows evidence of reversible ischameia involving the LAD and RCA territories. Note: The extent of ischemia in severe triple vessle disease may be underestimated due to balanced hypoperfusion. Functional information: Multi gated rest SPECT images show global hypokinesia of the LV myocardium with reduced systolic wall thickening with overall reduced resting left ventricular systolic function. LVEF 15+/-5%. IMPRESSION: Scan evidence of mild stress induced reversible ischaemia involving the apex; apicoseptal and apicoanterior segments and inferior wall of the LV myocardium. Reduced resting systolic LV function with RWMA as described as estimated by quantitative GATED SPECT. Please correlate clinically. Above the report of Stress Thallium test. Kindly suggest what to do. We took several opinions from several doctors; some says he should go for stenting; some says nothing can help him. We dont believe as heart can get deprived so fast without the patient knowing or feeling any indications before. Please suggest what to do. He is taking following medicines. I m giving you generic name: 1. furosemide (trade name in India is Lasix) 20 mg b.i.d. 2. spironolactone (trade name Aldactone) 25 mg o.d. 3. remipril (Trade name Cardace) 10 mg o.d. 4.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,What are the reasons for vit B12 deficiency. What are long term repercussions of such. What is the remedy,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with diabetes with high blood sugar levels around 3 months ago. I changed my diet; started medication; and started doing walks as per doctor's advice. My blood sugar levels came to normal with all these changes; which took around 3 weeks. After that suddenly I got severe pain in my feets. I had to take rest for 2 to 3 days when the pain cooled down and I could walk again. But anytime I walked little faster or little longer the pain would appear again and I had to take rest for couple of days. This went on and off for about 2 weeks and then I thought I should take rest for 2 to 3 weeks. I took rest and the pain cooled down buy still Iwas having pains in different parts of the feet even during rest. This has been now around 2.5 months and I still have mild pain that move around at different places of feet and sometime lower leg. Meantime I have consulted orthopedic doctors; nurologist; rheumatologist and vascular surgeon with basic tests done like x ray; mri; blood tests and ultrasound doppler test. All these tests are more or less normal as per doctors and do not explain the problem.I still continue to suffer from mild pain in my feets and occasionally lower legs; which increases with after doing short walks and cools down in rest but still happen doing rest. After daylong of short walks and standings the pain is more at night and I have to take pain killer and one medicine suggestefd by neurologist (pregab 75) to sleep.What can be the cause of this pain?,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 61-yr-old male with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed about 2000--and being treated with Glipizide; Metformin and Byetta. After managing to get results of standard test battery ordered by endo in late January (TSH=4.89 with .40--4.0 "normal" range; T-4--can't recall but it was "normal"); with 2-3 months to go before seeing endo-- and no urgency on his part--I concluded I am hypo. I started reviewing my symptoms--96.5 avg temperature...very high cholesterol...depression...and several more--and was able to get my internist to agree with hypo diagnosis 2 1/2 weeks ago. (He's nice guy; but just not knowledgeable enough to help manage my hypo; esp on top of diabetes; am trying to find a decent; openminded endo. Two possibilities locally; perhaps another 3-4 with 2 hour drive to Raleigh or Durham.) After starting on 50 mcg levothyroxin (manufacturer: Mylan) for two weeks; I was concerned Walmart might change to another non-branded generic at some point; screwing up my therapy. So I got my doc to switch me to Levoxyl late last week. About four days before the switch; I started having abnormally high pre-meal sugars (say; 180--200 before meals) which then dropped quickly in the 2-3 hours after meals to 60--100; when they would normally be 140--160... I've usually been pretty stable---(a1c is usually low 6 range)--though not consistently. But I'm concerned about how dangerous or lasting these sugar changes might be--and their cause. Does anyone know whether thyroid meds are known to play games with blood sugars; and whether this may be a temporary stage in adjusting after just starting these meds.? Personal experience is fine; but would also prefer to know about any research that may have been done on this. Are docs aware of it; and can it or need it be treated? Incidentally; I saw some acronyms that are apparently familiar to many who are long-time hypos; but were Greek to me; if anyone can explain---TPO....tpo ab.... Many thanks; Brian134,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Thank you for taking my question. I have been reading that PACs and PVCs are benign in the setting of a structurely sound heart. I have CAD and a 5 graft CABG but have had no heart attacks or heart damage. Does that mean that the PACs and PVCs that I have are benign? In other words; is someone who has CAD and no heart damage considered to have a structurely sound heart? Thanks again.,2006,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Sandalwood posted this study in the thread below on long term side effects after tx. I found this to be a real eye opener; in that it really validates the randon percentages of treaters that are reporting the exact same problems we have been discussing here on the forum. Thanks for posting this study; because it is very personal; comprehensive; and jarring! Look at the percentages of the 27 test subjects who report all sorts of issues. Consider how this random group could be extrapolated out into the entire treating community. I find the comments and conclusions in this piece to be the FIRST and ONLY that have honestly and thoroughly looked at this issue. The actual experiences of people after finishing therapy. For those that scoff at the idea of therapy after effects; or think its only a small; insignificant group....READ THIS STUDY. Thanks for finding this study Sandalwood.!!! Its unique. Here is the link. Note especially pages 16-20...and conclusions... http://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/File/Recovery_from_hepatitis_C_treatments.pdf I think we have only scratched the surface of the iceberg here on the forum. Who knows what the real long term issues might really involve; and how many are really affected. Like people say in the study...Where ARE the studies? Who did warn any of us of these long term problems? What are the doctors and drug companies doing to find out what is really the status? Read and enjoy....or cry...whatever the case.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 60 year old man with type 2 diabetes in fair control with metformin and Lantus; a bit of hypertension; good lipid profiles; good metabolic panels; no manifest symptoms compromising my quality of life...except for bouts of SVT that take me to the ER about every 1-3 months for a hit of adenosine to convert the rhythm. Every time I go to the ER they fuss at me to get an ablation; but frankly; I've just been scared about the (admittedly low) risks...but recently I've had to change medical plans; and the ER coverage just isn't as good as on my previous plans. If I end up in the ER for the adenosine jolt every time I get one of these; under my new plan I could end up paying in the five figures every year just to "manage" my SVT. I'm on 100 mg of metoprolol succinate a day; and it still doesn't keep the SVT away. I finally decided to get the ablation; and mine is scheduled for November 21. My EP doc is a guy who's done thousands of these procedures; who has studied with some of the foremost doctors in the field; and who projects every confidence that it's all gonna be fine. And I know the odds are with me. And I'm tired of having to worry about what I'd do if I had an attack of SVT on a plane flying over the ocean; or on a bus while I'm chaperoning a church youth group trip. Most of all; I feel like I can't afford the chronic trips to the ER to convert the rhythm. I used to be able to convert it myself through Valsalva; but it won't convert any more like that...it makes me a little bitter that the rhythm itself isn't dangerous; so in a sense it's an elective treatment for something that can be taken care of by trips to the ER. But the ER treatment is expensive...so it makes you put a price on your life; and apparently my wife and I have come to the decision that my life isn't worth not risking; so that we can save the money we're paying for the chronic trips to the ER. That said; I know the risk is low. And I've seen post after post from people who've had it done for SVT and who say it's the best decision they ever made. And I have confidence in my EP; and he uses anesthetic so I don't worry about any discomfort during the procedure; and he uses cryo for AVNRT and RF for AVRT and says he won't know which it is until he does the mapping; which makes sense...and I'd really love not to have to be troubled any more by this arrhythmia that's plagued me for 46 years. Still...I'm scared. I've set the date; and I'm resigned to it...but I'm scared. Not sure what I think sending this out into the InterWebz will accomplish; maybe I'm just venting. I need to get over myself; I guess.,2016,2016,59,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have type 2 diabetes. My doctor prescribed Byetta and I tried it for several months and the nausea side effects of it was devastating and caused me to gain even more weight. So; when my doctor told me about victoza and its weight loss benefits I was extremely excited about this revolutionary drug that would help lower my blood sugar level; AND LOSE WEIGHT at the same time. In the beginning; Victoza was God sent to me. My apetite decreased and I dropped 15 pounds in about 4-6 months. And I did not experience nausea at any time. Then; all of a sudden the weight loss stopped. My weight loss became stagnated and have been ever since. It has been 2 years since that time and while my blood glucose level and A1C is good; I have gained the 15 pounds back and more. No matter what I do; I cannot lose weight. Before Byette; my doctor tried many different kinds of pills (example metformin and glumetra) but the sides effects had my life on hold. I had untrollable bowel explosions 24/7. I hhave heard many people say they loss weight on these pills but not me; just the 24/7 bowel explosions. I would like to hear if anyone have ever experience hear loss whille on Victoza. I have not seen anywhere that this is a side effect but my hair began balding in big patches right after I got on Victoza and thinning out. It is still light this and I am so frustrated; conscioused and sometime down over it. I know it could be worse but my hair stylist is convince that it has to e=be my Victoza meds because this was not happening before. I bought expensive all natural hair vitamins with biotin in it that was spposed to help grow my hair back and make it full again but that made it worse. I have gone to a 2nd & 3rd hairstylist for their opinion and they are all at a loss and said it has to be my diabetes medicine. I even went to a a dermattologist but she did not know why it was happening. If anyone have this problem or know why this is happening since I became diabetic please let me know. My endocinologist said the only alternative is to place me on insulin bvut I refused because that would mean more weight gain plus the Victoza is working to keep my glucose under control.,2013,2013,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just found out that I have a TSH lab value of 18.79. What is in my future? I will not see my doctor for 10 days. This value is very high from what I can find out. Is it safe to wait 10 days? Is there anything I should do until my appt? What does it mean? I have never had an elevated value before. I have HOCM. I had a Septal Alcohol Ablation in 2001. I have a defibrillator and pacemaker that was implanted in 2004. I had a cardioversion Nov. 2007. I am a type 2 Diabetic on oral medications. Would any of these issues be related to the TSH report? If stress or depression is a factor I woke up in the middle of the night to find my 51 year old husband dead beside me in 2003. A close cousin passed away in late 2003; two very close aunts in 2004; my father in 2004 and my mother in 2006. It has been a nightmare!,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi All A few days back went to doctor for flue and she asked for some tests and that ended up in following: HEPATITIS C VIRUS ANTIBODY TOTAL (HCV AB TOTAL) 1.34 s/co SGPT (ALT) 74 U/L SGOT (AST) 35 U/L CREATININE (ENZYMATIC) 0.9 mg/dL HEPATITIS B SURFACE ANTIGEN QUALITATIVE (HBS AG QUALI) 0.14 s/co URIC ACID (SERUM) 5.79 mg/dL GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN. 6.71066 % Medicines GALVUS 50MG TAB.56'S LEGALON TAB 70MG.

I knew how to spell hepatitis correctly just yesterday :( and when doctor told me Hepatitis C . . . fatty liver . . . . I was just unable to standup even. How bad is my result? Any chances to be hopeful in PCR Test what test results will ensure I am not hep c patient? I had one time jaundice back in 2002 Please advise me where do I stand . . . . I am 42 years old male and really don't know what should I do? Kaiser,2013,2013,42,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 53 yr old Male; with a bad family history ( father died of CHF; all his brothers have had Heart Attacks due to blocked arteries. About three year sago I had some Heart palpitations; got about one episode per year ( I know its not much)....but quite scary. I reported this as possible 'Sinus Tachycardia' or SVT.....but never has been proven via Holter. Also did angiograms and showed some atherosclerosis/mild blockage of some heart arteries etc.....but not enough to Stent. I've been on Beta Blockers ( 25 mg Metaprolol Tartrate) for about three years; somewhat tolerated the drug. Used to exercise about 3-4 times a week. But this year; I found out that I also Type Diabetic ( as was my Dad & brother)....I was 'marginally' diabetic i.e. Blood Glucose 109 & A1C = 6.9. AFter trying diet & exercise; although my levels remained the same; my GP put me on 500 mg Metformin. Maybe coincidental; but since taking this drug in combo with my B-blockers; I have developed pretty bad anxitey; sometime inot panic attacks; also experiencing very slow heart rates 65-55 ( that is really slow for me). As a result; I just don't feel exercising; or even getting up to do a 1/2 mile walk ( that is real bad news for someone with some blockage). Its sending me over the edge........really impacting my life. Should I stop the Metformin ( I know I cant stop the B-blocker ). Shoudl I talk to my Cardiologist or GP for how I feel ? I am not sure if something else ( liek allergies etc) is causing my slow heart beat. I also work for a Pacemaker company; and I tend to over-analyze my situation quite a bit i.e. look at my own EKG's ( which looks quite normal).,2011,2011,52,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,As of April 2014 I am a 26 year old female; 5' 8"; 186 lb; otherwise healthy except for the following: Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed in Nov 2011. I was originally put on glyburide and metformin but within six months was taken off metformin and my birth control pill (which I had been on since 2006) due to a small adenoma on my liver found in April 2012. Subsequently I was put on Lantus and Novolog insulin. Autoimmune Pancreatitis diagnosed in April 2012. Originally hospitalized for four days in March; it was thought to be an acute case. In April I ended up back in the ER. I don't drink alcohol regularly (maybe 1-2 times a month and usually a glass of wine or a fruity cocktail) and there were no gallstones. My doctor wasn't sure of the cause of the recurring pancreatitis. I was put on prednisone until June when a stomach infection detected through an endoscopy. In June 2012 I stopped the prednisone and was put on azathioprine as an immunosuppressant. I was hospitalized again in July for four days and was put on nortriptyline to help with the nerve pain. July 2012 while I was dealing with the hospitalization for anther pancreatitis episode I also had an abscess high on my leg; in the groin area. It burst on its own; the doctor gave me antibiotics to deal with the infection and it cleared up and healed well within a week. I chalked this up to being prone to infections due to being diabetic and having a weakened immune system from the immunosuppressant. Everything was fine for a while but around May 2013 my period which had been regular for seven years disappeared. In October 2013 my GYN medroxyprogesterone acetate to restart my cycle which restarted irregularly but was less heavy than previously and has since evened out to be near regular again. October 2013 another leg/groin abscess appeared and was drained and packed by a surgeon; again I took antibiotics to help with the infection. It healed well within a couple of weeks. April 2014 I was diagnosed with anemia and have had two doses of feraheme IV therapy. Another leg/groin abscess has appeared in the same spot as the two previous times. I’m tired of dealing with all these issues and seeing a primary care doc; a GI doc; a hematologist; and a general surgeon. I feel like there must be some connection between these things; perhaps another diagnosis that has been missed. Has anyone ever deal with something similar?,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My father (born and raised in India) is 71 years old and has been living in the United States for more than 40 years. He has high blood pressure and type 2 Diabetes. He has been suffering from an Unknown Medical Condition since 2007. His symptoms have included: Shortness of breath since July of 2007; even with minimal activity and a 24 hour non-stop throbbing accompanied with sometimes pain and swelling in his head; mainly on the left side (from September 2007). The following tests were conducted to diagnose the throbbing in his head; none of them were conclusive: • He was sent to a Neurologist. The Neurologist thought that it could be “Temporal Arteritis”. He ordered for blood tests “SED rate and C-Reactive Protein” every week for 5 weeks. These results were normal. He also ordered MRI and MRA of his head to make sure he does not have an Aneurysm. The MRI; MRA and regular CT scan of his head did not show any problems. The Neurologist recently told him that he may have a dural AVM; but it will only be confirmed; if he gets an angiogram of his head. He is presently on the following medications: • Glimepiride – 2 mg once day (for BS) • Coreg – 25 mg twice a day (for BP) • Cozaar – 50 mg once a day ((for BP) • Januvia – 100 mg once a day (for BS) • Metformin ER – 500 mg twice a day (for BS) • Lipitor – 10 mg once a day (for Cholesterol) • Amitriptylin – 10 mg once a day (for relaxation) *BS – Blood Sugar *BP – Blood Pressure He’s been to a numerous amounts of doctors since then; and they have no conclusive answer. Obviously; an angiogram of the head is rather invasive; and we’re just looking for possible answers; possible diseases; infections; or anything to diagnose this mystery.,2008,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,.I am reading these posts and realize that they are very old but I am so desperate that I just want to be healthy. I am presently trying A.C.E. which is supposed to be an all natural weight loss; um NOT..waste of my money...I have so many diagnosis that I don't know what to do what to eat and what ever I do I don't lose weight. I crave suger; carbs as I have no engery all day long and that gives me just a quick fix I understand that but what to do. I am hypothyroid taking Levothyroxine; I have adrenal fatigue; Polycystic ovary Sydrome; High Cholesterol; retaining water like no other; and estrogen dominance and depression/anxiety can't imagine with all of this stuff going on being down. So yes am taking meds for each and then my doctor just put me on Metformin I am not seeing any results from this either. I am so frustrated and desperate a year ago I was 160 down to a size 8 and now I am at 211 and in 14/16's. I was doing the lite for life program when I just crashed and was craving suger like mad...well the sugar overcame me. Any suggestions out there please please replay to this desparate 43 year old wife and mother of three. God Bless. .

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I posted the bulk of this in the auto-immune & kidney forums; but I just want to get a "whadda you think" from people who have been through all the testing; diagnosis; MISdiagnosis; etc. I will post my current issue; then follow up below it with further background to explain why I feel this might be an appropriate forum for this. I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08; Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight; when there is no logical reason for it. Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone); PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal; just started Metformin therapy). On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June; my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a "normal" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website; but no mention was made to me; at my followup appt. On 01-06-10; I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit; my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again; no mention was made of this; although; in his defense; my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels; at this visit; which were very much out of range. I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here; as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59; for a woman; is suggestive of possible kidney damage; and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop; as they have in my case. I am obese (240 lbs); so I know that can affect the numbers; but I also have been plagued; over the yrs; with various auto-immune issues (ITP; Hashimoto's); and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes; that adds yet another concern. I do have some light edema in both legs; at the end of the day & severe pitting edema in my left leg; due to a severe injury in 2004; for which I wear a compression stocking. I know lymphatic system issues are another sign of kidney issues. ****Okay; now let me explain why I am thoroughly confused & troubled by all this (aside from obvious). As mentioned above; I have a history of KNOWN auto-immune problems. I also know that many of these disorders can overlap & you can very easily have more than one. What I can't understand is why the doctors are not discussing my eGFR & creatinine levels with me; given my past/current auto-immune problems & my current pre-diabetic state. My kidney function should be a glaring red flag to them; right now..esp. with the edema. What I did not mention above; but may have mentioned in old; old posts in other forums; is that I did have one ANA test done; a few yrs ago; after I saw my PCP for a VERY bizarre (for me) reaction to the sun. I am as lily white as they come & don't get deliberate exposure to the sun very often at all. That summer; I got a wild hair to add some color. On the very 1st attempt to sunbathe in my back yard; I had only been lying on the lawn chair for about 5 min. when my whole body started itching like ants were attacking me all over. I jumped up; thinking I had lain in an ant bed. Nothing. I tried to lay back down; but the itching was unbearable. I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to the sunscreen or the plastic on the chair; so I went in & took a shower. Within 30 min; I was covered head to toe in a "chigger-like" rash. My husband looked at it & said "You have chiggers!" We live in an area not known for chigger infestations; but I mentioned this to my PCP; & he agreed it was not likely chiggers. Because of the past auto-immune stuff; he ran the ANA; but it came back negative; so he diagnosed "contact dermatitis; unknown cause". I am now wondering; with everything else; if I didn't have a Lupus flare; despite the negative ANA. I've been too scared to tempt fate with the sun again. Also; since then; I have recurrent urticarial flares (hives); which sometimes cause my eyes & throat to swell shut (anaphylaxis). My PCP could not find a cause for that either; so he just wrote me an RX for an Epi Pen. Even if it isn't Lupus; I am very; very concerned & worried abt what might be happening to my kidneys. My understanding is that you can slow the drop of your eGFR & slow or stop the progression of kidney disease; but you can never regain those numbers or that function back. Kidney disease is nothing I want to mess around with. Any thoughts? Thanks; Angela,2007,2010,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Looking for any suggestions to take back to my Endocrinologist. 33 female 2.5 yrs now suffering w/these symptoms (ill list below) I've gone to many Primary doctors & Endo's begging for help. I've had many test done (multiple times); full thyroid panel is "perfect"; Negative for Cushings; IR/Diabetes; STDs/HIV; TB. I DO have low cortisol; Low Vitamin D; High testosterone. I have pcos & whatever is wrong w/me has made my pcos go Haywire. Pcos became worse AFTER this "illness" started up. Vitamin d won't/hasn't come back up w/meds. Was put on BC pills for the pcos; which 1 has made my symptoms even worse 2 I know BC is not proper treatment. Weight gain-packed it on fast-60+lbs Goiter- seen w/ultrasound goiter w/two nodules. It goes up & down in size. It was choking me; they started to shrink. Now going back up but feels like a mans 'Adams apple'. It feel like it's being pressed into my throat; it's sore & burns 24/7. No sore throat though. (I have no tonsils FYI) Stress-I get really angry or cry easily Heart palpitations(?) like a chugging/clogged feeling that makes me gasp for air. It happens at least 3x a week. I can be awoken out of my sleep; just sitting calmly etc. it happens. Brain fog-light headed; dizzy; confusion; can't think or speak properly often. No energy-never a boost; 24/7 its low I want to sleep all day but can't sleep but 3-5hrs. Skin has become very dry a little itchy all over. Now on back of hands & a few other spots on arms; become red. If I feel really sick backs of hands turn red/itch. Lost a lot of hair & my scalp feels tender; no sores. My mild life long anxiety has become Agoraphobia. I take Ativan now (only as needed. maybe 1x a week) no; I'm not addicted. I don't take it unless I'm having attack. My attacks come out of no where; I have no warning. I treat it during & not before. Doc gave the ok. Depression has become worse (of course) I've noticed a very tiny droop to left side of face. Left top eyelid droops lower; left cheek & left corner of mouth look a little off and a tad lower. I've had this odd back pain in the right kidney area. I was checked by CT scan; ultrasound & told kidney looks fine; urine is fine. Now it's happening on the left side. Hot stabbing & throbbing feeling. Scared because my Mom almost died from Kidney disease as a kid. I also have IBS-d (just always told I have it) Told possibly gluten allergies too Never been checked for Chrons I'm getting some unknown infection showing up in blood work 4 times last year. One of the times my surgeon (had emergency gall bladder surgery.) said I have an infection that couldn't be traced & they didn't believe it to be linked w/gall bladder. I stayed extra 3 days (total of 5) in hospital because they said basically the meds were having a very hard time attacking the infection. No info on WTH all that was about. (I'm extremely allergic to Penicillin if that matters?) My doctors say this or that is odd but apparently aren't concerned to dig deeper. I was put on Phentermine for my weight (it doesn't bother my anxiety or panic; odd I know) plus b12 injections weekly. None of that has ever given me energy; at all. I take half the pill & fall back asleep; no prob. It has helped w/ appetite control & im losing weight. As I said before I'm on BC pills; I take magnesium (uterine issues); prenatal Vitamins; prescription vit D 2xweek. I WAS taking Metformin & Myo-ino for pcos; it did nothing. Newer Endo said I shouldn't have ever been on those. (I have type2 pcos; no IR/No diabetes). I don't want any more pills thrown at me unless I actually need them. Therapy is now suggested; great but now more pills. If my mental is becoming worse from a condition/illness/disease/disorder wouldn't fixing that help the mental. Therefore more drugs for mental aren't really needed. IMO! I rarely ever drink caffeine; no coffee. Once in awhile Green tea. I drink loads of water daily. I never drink any alcohol; no smoking; no drug abuse/use. I try keep down on dairy (im lactose intolerant) I avoid soy (bad for my pcos) Wondering if it's thyroid; adrenals; pituitary gland ??,2016,2017,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I've had sphincter of oddi for years now; and finally got relief from Gabapentin. I think that everyone who has sphinter of oddi with normal liver results should try it. My tests are always normal; except 2 times that i had blood tests during attacks they were elevated. This would put me in the type III category of SOD. Gabapentin took away my attacks almost completely; which were ridiculously painful and happening at least a few times a week. Unfortunately; I still dont feel that great in other areas of the stomach; so im still searching for another medication that will take away all of my pains. Has anyone taken any other meds for this condition that seem to work???????,2009,2009,26,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi Am not having much luck with doctors at the moment. Since late oct i had extreme coldness in right leg and foot (i have achilles tendonitis in it) i went to my gp who said foot pulse was opk and should go away. Since then; it has got worse. it in both legs and hands and arms. (worse on right side) I get tingling in them too. Plus spasms/twitches in my fingers. Been back to my gp who says could be raynauds. But i dont have the typical white fingers etc for that. Its worse at night and gets painful. I had briefly mentioned to my neuro but he didnt seem interested only if it was related to my seizures. I have had it twice after a seizure in my arm. He did a thyroid test and that was normal. I just dont know what to do and my gp keeps saying come back when the weather gets better see if it gets any better. History Temporal lobe epilepsy since 2009.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,If this isn't quite appropriate for this forum; apologies - Diagnosed with PCOS about 10 years ago. Currently almost 40 and in beginning the process toward IUI; discovered my total testosterone has become very elevated - 347 last year (not caught my regular doctor) and 588 this July. Believed that the finasteride is what kept symptoms at bay all that time; combined with the knowledge PCOS gave me some hair and menstrual issues all along. My left ovary is enlarged (3.5cm measurements; versus 2.5 for the right); but I believe was enlarged 10 years ago during the ultrasound done 10 years ago. Adrenals show no issue in bloodwork and pelvic & abdominal MRI came in w/no noted abnormalities beyond PCOS appearance of ovaries. My repro endo says these numbers are too high to be anything but a tumor most likely; and a ovarian vein sampling requested by gyn onc came up with testosterone on the left ovary of 517 and the right at 314. Also being checked by regular endo for Cushing's or other potential long shots. I'm being told if both ovaries are producing those levels; there has to be tumors and both ovaries will have to come out. Given this started on a desire to attempt conception; needless to say I'd prefer to not lose ability to use my own eggs if possible. Since the tumors are not showing up readily; is there a test that would better pinpoint them to allow removal of only part of the ovary perhaps? Is appearance of tumors secreting testosterone in both ovaries simultaneously illogical in any way? Thanks!,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've been taking Vicodin for about a month now due to back issues and subsequent surgery. I'm still in pain but I want to stop taking them sooner rather than later. Will I have problems with withdrawal after taking 10/325 every 4-6 hrs for about 30 days now? Should I plan to do anything special? Thanks for your help...I want to stop this before it becomes a problem.,2010,2010,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I REALLY REALLY enjoy everybody's company here; but in all honesty; I do not belong. It is very clear I do not have MS but some kind of neuropathy. And as each day goes by; it's also pretty clearn what kind of neuropathy I must have and that is diabetic neuropathy. My BS's today were horrid - 2 hrs. after eating lunch which consisted of one Lean Cuisine Pizza and a handful of nuts was 173. I had no idea my numbers have been so high lately. Just two months ago; I was pretty normal with numbers. Just a measly gain of 6 lbs. and possibly this new med (Neurotonin) has pushed me over the edge as Quix said in an earlier post. I am going to call my Dr. on Monday and ask him to order the Glucose Tolerance Test and see just how bad it is. I have been "pre-diabetic" for about 5 years now - well; I guess I have crossed that bridge now; just like my Mom; my Uncle; my deceased Grandfather; and my husband. Uggggh. I'm feeling kind of down right now you guys. Anyway; on a good note; the compression stockings and the crocs did work today. I hardly felt any burning at all.,2007,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,hello i was diagnosed in 1995 with Graves disease. I drank radioactive iodine and after several attempts i got my thyroid under control with synthroid. Ive had to change my doses due to my test becoming abnormal or high again. I started out at .75 and now Im up to .175 per day. Well the recent test i had done 4 weeks ago said my TSH was 13. So they repeated it last week and now its 16. I am scared. I am confused as to why it keeps going up. I have other health issues like diabetes type 2 (just recently diagnosed borderline etc) no meds just exercise and diet. Im morbidly obese. i am recently diagnosed with hypertension. 168/92 .... I weigh 316. I did weigh 335 but have lost since jan 1st; 2008. I guess the thing that scares me is this all is hitting me at once. I am going to lose weight to get down to my ideal BMI.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi I am new to this board but wanted to ask how much can I rely on the snapshot Thyroid Tests? I have been dealing with the following symptoms since I was in my teens: severe fatigue; menstrual problems; chronic anemia; depression; pain for no apparent reason; brittle skin and hair; plantar fasciitis ; depression; anxiety and sleep problems. i have been to see general practitioners who diagnosed me with depression and put me on antidepressants which have not helped. I have seen gynecologists who have diagnosed me with PMS; Post- Partum Depression; Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder; Uterine Tumors; Early Menopause and one simply said I was lazy. Every doctor has had the same theme though by listening to my story and symptoms and immediately ordering thyroid testing. Every time my tests come back with my results in the middle of the normal range. Therefore the doctors all tell me since my tests are normal; there is nothing wrong with me and then give me an antidepressant prescription. I know something is wrong but how can I prove it if my tests results won't show the doctors?,2013,2013,38,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have had diabetes type 2 for 5 years and was managing it well with 3 x 500mg Metformin per day and diet and excercise. But unfotunately just before last Christmas I started to experience severe pain in both thighs (quad muscles) and both knees. After being admitted to hospital three times. I was diagnosed with the very rare diabetic complication Amyotrophy also other perrifial neuropathic problems in my lower legs in the shin bone are but not my feet or ankles. The hospital pain management team prescibed the 'convulsion' drug Gabapentin x 300mg one 3 times a day. Plus Doulepin 25mg in the morning and 75mg at night and 1 tamazapan 10mg at night plus co-proximal as required; plus 40mg statin at night. Three days after starting the Gabapentin and Dosulepin the severe pain in my thighs was reduced by about 90%. Unfortunately after taking these drugs for three months I have developed painful athritic pains and stiffness in both my shoulders and right hand. Is this a side affect of the drugs or is it part of my neuropathic nerve damage spreading to other parts of my body? I have lost over a stone in weight in the last 6 months; have muscle wastage and weakness in both thighs but mostly my left thigh. I can walk about 200 metres with a 'roller' walking aid; and about 50 metres with a walking stick.What is the prognosis of my condition? And are there any other readers who have this rare complication. If so I would love to hear their story. Thank you. Simon Male non - smoking age 53 from Buckinghamshire; England.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Iwas diagnosed with Diabetes in May. I am 38. 158lbs.(170 at diagnosis) Tried all the orals : Metformin;glyburide;actos. Sugars were controlled;but felt terrible. My tests indicate to Drs. I am or am becoming type 1 and concerned with weight loss so placed on insulin. Lantus -5 units. Sugars are controlled and A1c in the 6'es. The big problem is that I am basically foggyheaded all the time upon awakening. Unclear; drunk feeling although not like I am going to fall down. they have checked adrenal glands; thyroid;etc. there seems to be no pattern with sugar levels. Could it be the suger levels; or insulin itself?? Or something else. Blood flow to the brain issue. I have always been healthy and active. Now I am out of work and struggling with day to day activities. Any ideas appreciated.,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,39 year old female. Had my gallbladder removed at 21 and history of dormant HSV-2 and early onset Type-2 diabetes; foot and ankle arthritis and mild disk degenerative disorder and fungal infections in both foot and hand nails. Since my early to mid 20's I have experienced overwhelming cramping & bloating after eating which results in both constipation and diarrhea. Cramps are so bad that it stiffen's my entire body until it passes and occurs usually within 5 minutes after eating. Immediately after I often have to rush to the restroom and experience diarrhea. If I was to attempt to go into the restroom before my gut goes through it's "process" nothing will happen except a feeling of being nauseated. Over the years; I have also been experiencing sporadic nerve issues; seemingly unrelated; but worth the mention; including; Bell palsy at 29 years old to the right side of my face; bi-lateral carpal & cubital tunnel syndrome (diagnosed at the same time); paresthesia (pin prick sensation) mostly in my top and bottom lip; back of my right eye and occasionally in my legs. Intense bilateral neuropathic nerve pain and inflammation at the dorsal surface of my foot. Pain on both feet seems to stem from the either the Peroneal or Medial Cutaneous nerves and includes a ganglion cyst. Have increasingly developed Gait Instability. Have also experienced many muscle spasms across the body; including feet; calves; inner thighs; lower and side abdominal along with back and front of next. Over the last few years I have also been increasingly been having many cognitive issues. Such as progressive aphasia; brain fogginess; malaise; an overall feeling of being drunk or high without drinking; a pressure in my head while laying flat down or walking to certain areas; my body becomes numb or stiff feeling (especially the tops of my hands; fingers; face; cheeks; tops of arms and legs); slightly slurred speech; the inability to think straight and feeling disoriented or disconnected; unbalanced while walking or standing; along with anxiety; depression. I have also battled with recurrent episodes of having Cellulitis underneath my breasts; lower abdominal and inner thigh; which are always painful and often have to be lanced as they can grow out of control within 24 hr of first onset.. I have been tested and ruled out for having MRSA. Due to the many times of being on antibiotics; I now combat Oral Thrush whenever I have to take an antibiotic which results in me having to follow a regime of Antibiotic then 2 does of 200 mg Fluconazole and then 100;000 unit of Nystatin for an unknown determined of days until the thrush goes away. I have also developed bumps on the back of my tongue due to this; which make it difficult to swallow. I have also been noticing over the last 3-4 years that I will occasionally develop what resembles petechiae near the proximal base of my 2nd through 4th digits on each of my hands. It does not itch; burn or tingle and is smooth to the touch. It appears for no known reasons and stays for a couple weeks or so and then goes away as quickly as it appeared. It will then come back later; again for some unknown reason or apparent trauma. Over the 3-4 years or so it has occurred approximately 5-7 times. I thought at first that it may be Dermatitis Herpetiformis; however; I do not have Celiac's disease; nor is it painful. Throughout all of my symptoms I have never developed a known fever or loss of appetite and have no fissures; bleeding or ulcers. I have also never had to be hospitalized for any of my symptoms. I did once go a to the ER a few years ago because one of my legs swelled up pretty significantly; but all my blood tests came back fine and was sent home. I Have recently been given many tests without a definite diagnose as of yet. Have had the following routine blood tests that have all been within perfect range; CMP; Lipid; Urinalysis; Microalbumin/Creat Urine Ratio; TSH; T4 Free and CBC. Have also had non routine tests done such as DHEA; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Luteinizing Hormone; Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cortisol; DHEA-Sulfate; Ferritin & Magnesium RBC; all in which have been normal. My doctor also had me do a Reticulin Antibodies; and Endomysial Antibody and Celiac Eval; which also came back as negative. The only tests that she was concerned about was that my Blood Sugar which was averaged at 148 and that my A1C was 7.5; but I managed to bring it down to 7.0 within 6 weeks; in addition; my B12 was down at 260 pg/mL and my the vitamin D 25-hydroxy came back at 16 ng/M. In addition; my iron was slightly low; but I can't recall what it was; but I do know that I was not considered anemic. She has put me on 1cc B12 injections every two weeks and 50;000 units of Vitamin D2 1x weekly. I am also taking an array of medication to combat the pain and diabetes; including Gabapentin 300mg 3x daily; Celebrex 1mg 1x daily; Glimepiride 1mg 1x daily; Metformin 1000 mg 2x daily and Protonix 40 mg 1x daily. I have also been tested for Diabetic Neuropathy and that test also came back perfectly fine. My doctor thinks I may have a susceptibility to mold which could be the leading cause of all my issues; however; many of my issues have been going on for many years and I have lived in many different places since then and have never known to have a mold issue in any home I've lived in. She is going to have Integrative Medicine doctor to an HLA-DR genetic test on me to rule that out. She has also ordered me to have an MRI to rule out MS and also to undergo Physical Therapy for my feet as well as Pelvic Floor Therapy to help aid in my urinary incontinence and bladder issues. I have to say that my doctor is absolutely wonderful and we are just at the beginning of this hunt; but am still concerned that we may be missing something. I know that not all my symptoms are related to one another; but I do strongly feel that most of them are. I am hoping that someone out there may be able to help me and see something that we may not and help to lead us into the right direction. I have thought of many scenario's that may be causing all of this and am at a loss. I don't think it's Lupus because my symptoms are ongoing for the most part and I don't have episodes of a "flare up" as well as my kidney functions are fine and no hair loss or scaly or red rashes. I also don't believe it's Crohn's because I also don't fit many of those symptoms. I have often thought it's possible that maybe that I have a Candida overgrowth especially in my gut as that does follow many of my symptoms; I just can't determine if that would cause sporadic nerve issues. I have also often wondered if being that my HSV-2 is a central nervous system disease and it has basically always stayed "dormant" because I have only had one break out once in my life if instead it is attacking my nervous system than it is causing or creating physical lesions. I was once told that it could have been the reason why I had Bells Palsy so I guess the thought isn't too far fetched. And also who knows all of this could be due to my vitamin B-12 deficiency and I could have already found the culprit. If any one that may be able to tell me if any of this may lead to something I would be forever grateful because I am tried of living this way. It prevents me from living the life I know I deserve and has essentially killed every bit of dignity and confidence that I ever had and I am ready to take my life back and battle whatever it is I'm fighting. I apologize for the long list; but I felt it was better to give the whole story than to only give a few things that could really be anything.,2018,2018,39,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Thank you John and also you too sara for your comments. We have updated the post with the consultants words and medication list. Hope this helps; please keep us informed; and we likewise of any further developments. Thanks Dave n Nicola 3years ago I had a mild stroke; and since that day; ive been having TIA type attacks near daily. WHY? I need answers and help PLEASE. Hi my name is Dave. I am requiring any help feedback; as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms; 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company; I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. This was due to 20years 15hour day 6/7days a week workaholic lifestyle; in senior business management and also running my own part-time business as well as working for private and public companies. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old. Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago whilst having a nice stroll near the beach at Cleethorpes; with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy so we decided to drive back home to Doncaster. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. Luckily my 24year old daughter who had just popped in mentioned to my wife; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; ‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’ I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months; I have not hardly had a recurrence; just slight shakes now and then. These episodic attacks are now as frequent as three times a day and sometimes 7days a week; where I suffer episodes of stroke type symptoms; during my sleep; and twice during the day. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a bad attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; which then ends with me displaying the symptoms as already described on numerous occasions and literally ends with me sleeping heavily; and my leg and arm feels like a lead weight; these have been seen by many medical professionals within Royal Hallamshire Sheffield Hospital; Doncaster Hospital; the nurses at the local GP and local CMHT. A heavy attack has the following symptoms; dizziness; pain in my head; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so. These attacks happen during my sleep; as my wife is unable to wake me up in the morning and when i do finally wake up; i have the tell-tale left sided face droop etc; they can happen anytime of the day; whilst I am sat watching tv etc. sometimes 2 to 3 times a day for up-to 7days. My memory is terrible; i am unable to concentrate for long periods; i also lose my balance a lot; and I sometimes have a very severe pain; behind my left eye socket; and this does not go away with painkillers. However after an attack; my limbs are weak for a day after. Once i have recovered ie woken up after a sleep from 2 to 4hrs; i feels sometimes like I am drunk and very hung-over for a day or two; I am completely washed out; with varying pains; headaches and i am unable to walk once these attacks happen and i am very weak on my left side leg and arm daily and on-going. I get dizzy spells during an attack and also when im not having an attack. Also I am slurring; or mumbling during an attack; my speech is clear when I am not suffering attacks however my wife and children have stated that sometimes i say the wrong words or whilst speaking sometimes put the wrong words that im trying to say; in the wrong part of a sentence; which they find amusing; and i find frustrating and angry with myself for doing that; but i do not have slurred speech outside an attack unless I am tired. . My vision has deteriorated since the stroke; and my left eyesight is terrible; i have just been diagnosed with glaucoma and diabetes and early stages of diabetic retinopathy; however the medics are looking into my eyesight issues but with no joy. I have also been experiencing in addition to the other symptoms; pain in my bones on my left side and back; especially when i retires to bed at night; to the point where we have had to obtain a loan to purchase; a £3000 hospital type adjustable bed; which has not really alleviated the pain. I am under a psychiatrist for depression; but nothing seems to be working for me; I am on medication; I have been tried on different medication over the 8years and im currently on 40mg of fluoxetine a day. My depression seems deeper since the stroke and i am struggling daily.,2012,2012,47,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dear Doc; About 6 months ago; I was driving down the highway and had a panic attack out of no where. I am not sure where it came from. I have had heart palpations for a long time but nothing has come of it. They became worse so I worried about them. I have been a worry my whole time. I have pre-hypertension blood pressure and about 6 months when the panic attacks started began taking blood pressure medicine. Since then I have had ECG; EKG; MRI; CT; CCTA and multiple extensive blood work and lab test done. I have tried multiple anti-depressants and recently taking Wellbrutin and Buspar for depression and anxiety. I was recently diagnosed with an Anxiexty Disorder that lead to depression but my bottom line question that no one can answer is....ever since this started 6 months NO MATTER how many medicines I take or currently taking I have this feeling that I am drunk or having a buzz like I have been drinking. This feeling will not go away and none of the medications have helped this. Do you have any suggsetions? Frustrated....,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm going to tell you my story; and I would really like to hear from anyone who has had similar experiences. I have always had acne since about grade 7. My periods started getting kind of wacky; and when I was 18 I started noticing hair growing on my lower stomach. I immediately freaked out! (Like any other normal woman would) and went to every possible doctor I could. I was even having very intense pains running down my inner thigh coming from my lower abdominals. I saw one doctor who suggested to me that I may have PCOS. I was living down south and I came back home. I went to see my doctor here because I was also having very disheartening emotional problems (depression and anxiety). She started me on Diane -35 (birth control) to lower my androgens and suggested I start taking spironolactone. I only started taking the birth control pills and within 3 or 4 months of starting it I was so depressed and anxiety ridden that I had to stop taking the pill. I immediately noticed a difference in my moods improving (but not completely) and I knew then that I was going to have to find an alternative option to the birth control pill. I went to my doctor numerous times as the hair kept growing and spreading. I have had my hormones all tested many times and I have elevated male hormones but they are not outside of the normal range. WELL HOW COULD I BE GROWING HAIR ON MY STOMACH IF MY LEVELS WERE NORMAL? My doctor told me "some women are harrier; your background could contribute to it.... by the way I'm German and I didn’t know they were supposed to be sasquatches) I kept asking for more tests though and my triglycerides were high; and prolactin was high. Meanwhile; I’m not on any pills and I am completely frustrated! Not to mention the anxiety and moods/depression that I still live with everyday. I started having laser hair treatments. I bought a book on how to treat PCOS with natural health. I asked to be tested for insulin resistance (which is linked to PCOS) and my results were inconclusive; and apparently I had a test which rarely even shows insulin resistance. I finally got a new doctor; who FINALLY booked me for an ultrasound (I’m 22 now). I got it done; and what do you know!!! I have one abnormally large cyst on my left ovary and small cysts covering both of them. AND after all that time; I finally find out what’s actually happening to me. But they still haven’t been able to help me. They just keep trying to prescribe me medications! Do you want Diane 35? No; my body can’t handle it for some reason. Do you want to take spironolactone? No; Id rather not take a diuretic; or chance what happened when I took Diane 35 for the first time. So doctor; what does this mean for me? Do I have PCOS? Am I insulin resistant? Will I be infertile? Doctor: just because you have cysts doesn’t mean its pcos; or that you are insulin resistant. We won’t worry about you being infertile until you think about having kids... Well wouldn’t you think that I would like to know now so that I can make changes in my life to make sure I can have kids? Anyway sorry to veer off and start complaining about the medical system. The point it; I have gotten no help. I have seen multiple doctors; naturopaths; and a gynecologist. I have tried diets for hormone health; including organic natural foods; low GI foods; read books on hormone health and pcos. I have taken herbal remedies for the hair growth. I've lost weight; (I’m not even that big to begin with); worked out; and I still don’t seem to be getting anywhere real fast. Right now I am 22; I am on alesse (which has more minimalistic side effects on me; but still causes mood swings and depression); and I am doing laser. (Which I have to say is expensive but the best thing I have found so far) Has anyone else had these types of experiences? Does anyone have any suggestions? Does anyone want a buddy to share stories with?,2008,2008,21,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 52 year old women who has had gallbladder surgery in April of 2006. It was infected. Ever since I have had the gallbladder surgery; I keep getting sick. I vomit a lot and end up with diarrehea and sometimes both at the same time. I am also a diabetic. I have type 2 diabetes. I am unable to eat the proper foods due to the damage bile duct. I could not figure out as to why I keep getting sick up until a year ago when I came down with a real bad kidney infection. My dr. thought I had kidney stones so was sent in to have a CT done. I did not have kidney stones. What was found was a narrow bile duct due to the gallbladder surgery. I was sent to a dr. to have this taken care of by having the dr. to put a stent into my bile duct. Well; he could not get the stent into the bile duct due to it is so narrow according to him. He told me that he would try again. He never did try again. I suffer a lot with this issue. I get pain on my right side where my gallbladder use to be; indigestion so bad and cramping in my abomen plus diarrehea and I also vomit a lot. My stomach swells up as well. I am either constapathed of getting sick from the diarrehea and vomiting all the time. I have to be careful as to what I eat. Is there any type of other surgery that will help open up my bile duct? I am at my witts end and can't take getting sick anymore. It hits me in the middle of the night when I am sleeping. It discusses me to no end having to deal with this issue. I have no control over the diarrehea and the vomiting. My Metformin most of the time; I find it in the toilet in the mornings. ( It does not dissolve) I am on Nexium and without taking the Nexium; I am worse off. I need help here. After reading some articles online; this is scaring me.I read that this can be dangerous to most people. I also had colon surgery 27 years ago this past March. I had a tumor on my colon plus a couple of polyps. It was all benign but they had to remove a 3rd of my colon. I never suffered from any type of sickness afterwards like I do now. So I know my symptoms are not from having the colon sugery. Please help!!!,2011,2011,51,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Please help me understand my readings: 3/24/2012-TSH 0.236; Free T4 1.00 4/16/2012- Anti-Microsomal 599 IU/ml Thyroglobulin Ab <20 IU/ml 5/16/2012-TSH 0.693 Free T4 0.98 Free T3 3.74 7/5/2012-TSH 1.307 uIU/mL Free T4 1.04 ng/dl Microalbumin 30 mg/L mg/L I was excited thinking I don't have hypo/hashi's with the now normal tsh levels. However; my PCP; informed me because of the Anti-Microsomal 599 IU/ml being so high; that's how it's determined. Anyhow; he told me that he's happy to see that my tsh levels are back to normal; but in time they'll go off the chart that he was using in explaining to me. He said it's at that time; he'd put me on medicine's. I;ve read because the Anti-Microsomal are high; even though the tsh levels are normal now; I should be on medicine. Please advise as to your opinion. I'm real concerned; because I now have high liver enzymes and from what I've read the reason could be from the hypo/hashi's? therefore; in the meantime I'm unable to take my metformin and lipitor. In the meantime he had me go for a thyroid ultrasound and the results of that are normal. It reads: The right lobe measures 4.1 x 1.5x1.5 cm. The left lobe measures 3.8 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. Heterogeneous thyroid parenchymal echotexture without evidence of a discrete nodule. My understanding is that if my ultrasound was normal; there would be no concern of thyroid cancer and no reason for a thyroid scan. Am I correct? or am I missing something? Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Tags: Thyroid,2012,2012,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 13 years ago and was put on Synthroid. I'm a 53-year-old female. About five years ago; my current doctor added Liothyronine. I have been on 88 mcg Levothyroxine and 25 mcg Liothyronine for a while now My blood results from a few weeks ago included TSH .07 (.34-4.82); T4 (Thyroxine) Free .59 (.52-1.4); T3 (Triiodothyronine) Total 118 (60-181); and T3 Reverse 11 (8-25). My doctor tried to explain to me twice how my TSH at .07 was normal; but I still don't understand. She didn't change any dosages on my thyroid meds. In the meantime; I've been having a lot of heartburn; constant sore throat (which doesn't look red when looking through my mouth because it's deeper down); a raspy voice; crackling sounds in the back of my throat; wheezing; and generally feeling really run down and tired. I saw an ENT who doubled my Prilosec for a month; put me on a heartburn diet; and has me doing nasal saline rinses twice a day. A month later; the upper chest burn moved down to my gut (for which I will now see a gastroenterologist); but the throat pain and raspy voice were not any better. Looking through my nose with a scope; he saw infection deep in my throat; so he put me on an antibiotic. He also found a nodule on my thyroid; so he sent me for an ultrasound. The ENT office called me late yesterday afternoon to tell me they had my US results and to make sure I keep my follow-up appointment; which isn't until Sept. 3. Of course; my thought is that if the results were fine; they would have just told me that; so now I'm a bit apprehensive. To add to all this; I'm anemic; type 2 diabetic; hypertensive; and have fibromyalgia. I'm also a 7-year breast cancer survivor. Does anyone have any thoughts for me about any of this; or do you need any more info? Thanks for reading.,2014,2014,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Today is day 10 - I still don't feel great. Last night the rls was bad. How long until that part goes away ? On a much more frightening note. I am blind in one eye. I was just diagnosed with having a cataract in my good eye and I need surgery. I'm 43 yrs old. I also have diabetic retinopathy (controlled) in my good eye so that makes the cataract surgery; potentially; more complicated. When I have the surgery done; am I going to be "hooked" on pain killers again ?? Can I do something to avoid that happening ? So far; it looks like the surgery may be scheduled for the end of this month and I'm not looking forward to it because of the risks involved. I'm stressed and having a hard time with this..,2007,2007,43,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,10 months ago I became over medicated and my doc has been lowering my dose of Tirosint by 12 mcgs ever since. A week or so ago my eyes had a flare up of swelling; running and aching [have had this when under medicated too] apparently it isn't too common because I posted about this with not much response. Now I have fluid retention else where too [maybe I had too much sodium] and my digestion is slow with reflux again. I have had the jitters off and on; trembling; racing heart at times; but now feeling tired/slow;; palps have stopped. My doc lowered my dose again; 4 days ago to 88mcgs Tirosint; I was told to stay at 12.5mcgs Cytomel. Every lab done before this had had a FT4 at the very top of the range; FT3 has been at the upper 2/3 or higher; no TSH and high RT3. Here are my labs from last week; before dose lowered: 100mcgs Tirosint 12Cytomel TSH less than 0.006 FT4 Direct 1.48 0.8-177 FT3 3.3 2.0-4.4pg/ml RT3 24.1 9.2-24.1ng/dl Do you think the RT3 could improve as I lower the T4? Am I over medicted or do I need additional Cytomel for the fluid; vision thing? Any opinion would be helpful! I have Hashi's and my last labs where good on iron; D etc... But I do have some low cortisol in the AM; based on saliva testing. My last labs on Cholesterol and Trigs where very high; also my A1C was high...which is unbelievable because I eat so well; so I think my thyroid meds are not working at the cellular level; hence the high RT3 [which my doc is not concerned about] She's about ready to put me on Statins and Metformin. Had none of this until my thyroid got wacked out..gained 30lbs in 3 months; the vision issue and totally debilitated from pain and my body not functioning properly. Have not been right since. I wonder if I may have Graves as well; will ask for that test! Very concerned that this is causing permanent damage to my organs and bones...put my doctor has no sense of urgency. Thank you so much for your help!,2012,2013,49,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just got copies of my MRI's and MRI reports and was wondering if any of you may know what it means. I have figured out what some of it means; but not so sure about the rest. I will post a few of the slides a little later on. It was done on a 1.5T machine. I have never truly thought I had MS; but I kind of figured thats what the neuro sent me for the MRI for just to rule it out. I do however; still think there is something neurological going on. I do know there is something wrong and I have felt like total **** for over a year now. I am tired of being tired....lol I just want answers!! I am still having numbness in my arms and legs; along with severe muscle cramps (sometimes it feels deeper that just muscles) and a buzzing sensation in different areas of my body. I have had lab work to rule out electrolyte imbalances; ect... for the muscle cramps. My muscle's actually knot up (you can feel the knots) and you can sometimes visibly see them. I am also still having the zap feelings in my neck and muscle twitching in my extremities. Have any of you had the problems with the muscle pain and knotting? I am at the end of my rope with all of the pain and no answers. I need help and it seems like none of the doctors listen to me!!! It took me a year of explaining about my head pressure before I finally figured out what it was; and it was my eye doctor who figured it out!! Anyway this is what the reports say: C-Spine -moderate reversal of cervical lordosis -multilevel slight disc bulges from C3-4 to C6-7 -uncovertebral joint disease is greater on right at C3-4 w/moderate right neural foraminal narrowing and relative effacement of right lateral recess. -craniocervical junction is unremarkable. Brain -ventricular system and basal cisterns are grossly normal -vascular flow voids are normal in T1 and T2 weighted images -mucosal thickening in ethmoids -nasal septum deviation- convexity towards left -post-contrast imaging demonstrates a developmental venous anomaly in left frontoparietal region I also wanted to ask about bladder issues. I have had waken up in the middle of the night a couple of times feeling warmth from urine leaking and try to get out of bed to use the bathroom and completely lose my bladder. I didn't feel the urge to urinate either time and while trying to stand up; and while walking to the bathroom the urine just kept coming and I couldn't control it. Have any of you had this problem? Thanks for reading and God Bless!! Miranda,2007,2008,27,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I finally went to the Endo last week because of all the symptoms I am having and thought I was having an issue with my thyroid. Tests came back within the "normal" range. I am a 43 yr old female. I have Fibromyalgia and have for over 10 years; so I'm achy; but to me that's just "normal". I have gained (according to them 50lbs but according to my scale about 35lbs in 9 months). I work out 3-4 days a week. I have a pretty decent diet; not big on junk food. I'm always tired (I even yawn at the gym!!) regardless of how much sleep I get. I have zero sex drive. Dry/Brittle Hair My hands get cold for no reason. I have bad night sweats Constipation My mood swings are horrid Dry skin (but I live in Colorado...so it's normal for here). The only tests the Endo did was the TSH and Free 4. Along with 2 for diabetes (thankfully those are "normal" and I don't believe that's the issue anyways). She put me on Metformin to help with the weight loss. But has stated "your thyroid is not the reason for your weight gain". Great...but something is! I'm not eating McDonalds every day or a dozen jelly donuts a day! She never once addressed my Fibromyalgia as an underlying problem. I have a friend who has been diagnosed; and she thinks I should go to her Dr. who does much more extensive testing. If I don't get myself "fixed"; it'll probably be an end to my relationship. Not due to the weight gain (he's been very supportive with this); but more the mood swings. I'm not pleasant to be around sometimes. I don't think the endo did enough to find out what is really happening..just put me on a drug for weightloss instead. Suggestions on what other tests should be done? I know my body..and this is NOT me. Something is off and I need to find out what the root cause is. Thanks!!,2012,2012,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. I hope someone can help. I'm an American that has been living in Qatar for the past eight months. This problem I have has been bothering me for most of this time. My wife isn't experiencing the same symptoms. I often wake up at before dawn with extremely itchy legs. It usually happens at that time; and only when I'm at home. Only my legs display these symptoms. They do feel itchy sometimes after a shower; but not as severe (almost like an after-effect of whatever bothered me at night). I am a deep sleeper; and this itch on both my legs doesn't fail to wake me up night after night; month after month. I use moisturizer hoping that it helps (it doesn't). I recently came back from a visit to the US; and I can say I never woke up from itching while there. A few days after getting there; I forgot that I had the problem at all. When I got back; I was going to sleep around dawn each night. Interestingly; the problem didn't come back until tonight. I went to bed earlier; and woke up with the same intense itching as before about an hour and a half before dawn. I thought it might be bed bugs because of the timing of the itch; but as I understand it they leave visible bumps. I have none (just intense itching at that time of night). Dust mites might be present here; and I may be allergic. However; I don't display any other symptoms of being allergic to something right now. And why is it only my legs that are itching? And why only intensely an hour before dawn? It's not soap; detergent; or the fabric I wear (I've tried eliminating those things already). What am I missing? Just in case someone thinks I may be crazy; I can now prove I'm not. I just talked to my father who was here for a visit; and he admitted to me that he had the same exact symptoms while staying here in my house an few days ago. Please help...,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've noticed I'm hungry all the time now. I am not overweight or anywhere close to it. I weigh about 108 lbs; in my teen years; female; i eat very healthy; but lately I'm hungry no matter what. I'll eat breakfast around 6:15; then around 10 I eat a snack. I eat lunch; then right after i got hungry. When I get home; I eat another snack; then dinner. About an hour after dinner; I eat another snack until I go to bed. I am not gaining any weight; but I was just wondering why I could be hungry all the time.,2006,2006,13,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I quit drinking pop; unless it is diet. I stopped drinking coffee and only drink tea (with like 2 sugar cubes and a small amount of lite half and half). I drink 1-2 bottles of water a day (this is up from none). I do not eat after supper (supper is usually at 7ish); and I used to eat all kinds of snacks right up until bedtime. I have been doing these things for (the pop one is about a year); a few months. I have also included light exersize at work; and making sure I get up and out of chair at least once per hour at work. As well as using my wii fit and other wii games at home and trying to sleep more regular hours; and eating a low fat high fibre breakfast (I never used to eat breakfast - but would start snacking around 9am until lunch)... and I have not only not lost any stinking weight; but I have gained a few more pounds. Short of starving myself or making myself vomit after each and every meal (and not sure either of those would work at this point either); I do not know what to do. I have in the long ago past been a smoker; and also had bouts of eating disorders (both anerexia and bulemia) of which I am not proud; but the past is the past. I had a gallbladder removal surgery about 8 years ago; and at the time my liver had started to fail. I currently have fatty liver disease (of which the doctor said was nothing serious; and they do nothing for it - but I read about different enzymes to take to help with digestion; and I take them although not faithfully as they are expensive); so now I have to wonder why am I losing nothing???? Anybody have any other doable idea's; I do not want to spend a crap load of money and continue getting the same results I have been getting. I am about to start the master cleanse; in a few days... I am a little worried about doing that while working and caring for 4 very busy children; from 17 to 5. However I am determined to get back into shape; I am tired of being OBESE... it *****.,2009,2009,34,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 37 year old male. 2 1/2 years ago I started getting these symptoms. It felt like a Head cold. Felt like wet forehead (inside). Couldn't concentrate; sometimes confused low ambition; poor memory; cranky. Lose track of what I was doing. Gazing alot. Ears slightly blocked; tingling in different parts of my head. Just like a head cold. Here is my problem!!! It has never left!! I was convinced it was a head cold because of the blocked ears wet tingling sensations etc... So I went to doctor; he thought it was anxiety or stress induced. Changes in my life; new business etc.. So he prescribed celexa. I am no longer cranky; more calm; but other symptoms are still here. Then 1 year ago was my worst year. Could hardly work. Tired constantly;eyesight blurry. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. So I take metformin. 500mg 2times a day. Symptoms are still here. I seem to need about 10 hours sleep. I take Unisom to sleep. So I am left with the original symptoms; forgetfulness; ears slightly blocked can't focus on work. Can I run new business again? Scared. Is it nervous system; or immune system? It really feels like a head cold I never got healed from. Is there fluid in my head that won't go away? I feel disabled. I am only 37 and want to start getting healthy but have no motivation. I am 195lbs 5.5 height. I got bells palsy also 4 years ago. It left within 3 months. Please help.,2007,2007,37,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Just FYI - if you have IR you might want to also keep on top of this one too. Better safe than sorry....I don't want to be the harbinger of doom but I know IR is a problem for some folks around here. I hate HCC if you can't tell.....no more of my friends should die of this. -------------------------------------- Higher HCC risk with increased insulin resistance in hepatitis C patients May 12; 2010 Recent studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Insulin resistance (IR); which correlates inversely with circulating adiponectin concentration; is a consistent finding in patients with type 2 DM. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported to be associated with increased IR. Recent studies suggest that IR plays a crucial role in fibrosis progression; and has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on treatment responses to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A research article to be published on May 14; 2010 in the World Journal of Gastroenterology addresses this question. The research team led by Dr. Hung from Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital prospectively investigated the IR assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and serum adiponectin level in two independent cohorts of consecutive newly diagnosed HCC patients and those with different clinical stages of chronic HCV infection. Among 165 HCC patients; type 2 DM was more prevalent in HCV subjects compared to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or non-HBV; non-HCV cases. HOMA-IR was higher in HCC patients with HCV than in those with HBV infection. In 188 patients with chronic hepatitis C; HCC subjects had higher blood sugar; insulin level and HOMA-IR than those with chronic hepatitis and advanced fibrosis. Based on stepwise logistic regression analysis; HOMA-IR was one of the independent factors associated with HCC development. This result was similar even if the diabetic subjects were excluded for analysis. The research team concluded that increased IR; regardless of the presence of diabetes; is significantly associated with HCC development in patients with chronic HCV infection. These findings may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in the management of chronic HCV-infected patients. Since IR is a potentially modifiable factor; therapeutic intervention aimed at decreasing IR may be warranted in these patients.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; Before I was diagnosed with my prolactin producing pituitary tumor; hasimotos; diabetes and high blood pressure (just to name a few) I was experiencing middle of the night nausea; very similar to morning sickness. After a few weeks of treatment with Dostinex for the tumor my prolactin levels went back to normal and my middle of the night nausea stopped. It has since resumed and it wakes me up... often I even incorporate how I feel into my dreams before I wake up. Anyone else with this problem? Could my prolactin have spiked again; even though I am still on Dostinex? Something else maybe? Thanks; Sarah,2008,2009,30,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This tint of green-overall not blotches; has happened before in the past a few times. My vision is not deteriorating; but I'm trying to link it up to something in my diet (or lack of). It occurs immediately upon awakening; but only lasts a few seconds; then everything is normal. I'm 50 y/o woman with no health problems (thyroid exception). My BP is usually normal between 120 -130 but can spike shortly a bit higher. I take no BP meds. Could it be a spike in BP? I had some unusually salty food last night. Or could it be something else?,2012,2012,51,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Some in the community have expressed interest in having a weekly weigh in again; in order to help keep each other accountable and maybe motivated. I realize that not everyone weighs on Sunday; but that's okay. You can weigh whatever day you choose; then just enter it on Sunday; or if you weigh on Mon; just wait till Mon to post on the thread. Here we go....... I haven't been doing real well lately; even though I've really been giving it my best shot. Most of you don't know me; so here's a little bit about myself. I'm retired; have had hypothyroidism since 2007 and have recently been diagnosed with pre-diabetes/metabolic syndrome. This means that my body does not use insulin properly; so it shuttles whatever I eat; directly to fat cells. Over the past 3 months; I've actually gained approximately 8 pounds and nothing I do seems to be getting rid of it; even though I'm working with my doctor's office in an effort to maintain diet and exercise. I need to lose a total of about 25 pounds; but for now; I'm setting my goal smaller than that. I'll be happy to lose 15 pounds; then I can go on and try to lose the rest. Now; it's your turn; tell us something about yourself and your goals; if you like and let us know how we might be able to help you reach your goal(s).,2008,2013,63,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar; Major Depression; Panic Attacks; and Paranoia several years ago. I am on alot of meds right now. I am on Depakote 500mg x 2 @bedtime; Gabapentin 100 mg x 2 capsules 3 times a day; Lunesta 3mg for sleep @ night; Clonazepam 0.5mg 3 x a day; Lexapro 20mg x 2 @ bedtime; and Budeprion 150mg every am. I went to my Psychiatrist yesterday and because I stay depressed she was going to take me off the Lexapro but did not. She did not take me off of it but did say if I come back next month as depressed she was going to take me off of it because she did not think it was helping. She did mention putting back on an anti-depressant in place of it. Therefore; I am confused on all this. Just wondering if anyone has a comment on all this. I have tried alot of meds. If anyone could help I would certainly appreciate it. God Bless.... Pam,2008,2008,46,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,A few days ago I was sitting reading and watching tv when I felt this strange sensation of moderate uncomfortableness/mild pain in the right top of my head. It was enough to make me flinch and be concerned but there was no severe pain. It seemed to me like it might be located under the scalp vs deep inside my head. The sensation seemed to be two separate but closely parallel pulsating streaks like lightening. This lasted only a few seconds then went away. I didn't have a headache; didn't notice any faintness; dizzyness; weakness or change in vision that I could tell. The next day I noticed a steady mild discomfort seemed to be present in my scalp/head alongside the temple just in front of my right ear. My ear seemed to feel some discomfort in it; almost as if I was getting an earache (which I didn't really get) and a feeling of fullness; this feeling also continued on behind the lower point of the jaw joint and down into my neck; like where one might feel discomfort from a swollen gland. Today this sensation still exists and the skin of my face on the right in this same general area feels just ever so slightly numb and tingly; like the very beginning sensation you start to get after receiving a novacane shot. If I turn my head far to the right I can feel the uncomfortable feeling near my temple/ear and neck more. I also have some mild pain if I press moderately hard on the spot on my head that originally had the "lightning like" flashes of discomfort. The same is said if I press on the areas where I feel the discomfort along the temple/ear/neck. Could this be caused by some sort of plaque breaking loose and traveling through an auricular vein? I have not seen the doctor for this yet. I have an appointment on the 18th this month for my 6 month check up for Diabetes type 2; at my last check I was found to now be in the "prediabetic" range. I am taking Metformin 500 mg once a day; and Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 once a day for hypertension. My blood pressure has been in the nornal to high normal range but lately I have been under a lot of stress. I am 41; 5'7" and 305 lbs. I plan on talking to the doctor about this head thing at my appointment but am wanting answers now incase I should try to get in sooner.,2011,2011,41,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I came across this site trying to gather information on what has been happening to my face. I have always suffered from acne; yet in the past years it has gotten out of control (i am 27). I do not have cysts regularly; but my face is cluttered with numerous small acne bumps; most hidding little very thick hairs beneath them and puss. I know my acne is rooted from facial hair. I try to pluck them and I get acne when they begin to grow back; and ingrown hairs. I try to get the ingrown hairs out and it results in wounds and scaring. I really do not know what to do at this point. I tried laser; yet after the first session my face got out of control. I believe it must have happened when they first shaved my face (standard procedure for laser hair removal)- yet the shaving opened all the little acne bumps and must have allowed it to spread. Someone mentioned diabetes and menstral cycle problems. I have very irregular periods and have been diagnosed with " PCOS " (a pre-diabetic stage). I know my facial hair is rooted to this problem; yet I do not know how to fix it. If others reading this have facial hair; acne; and gain wegiht easily (even if you are not overweight; yet it is hard for you to maintain a stable weight across the year) ; then I would get tested for PCOS. I have acne; thick facial hair around both my cheecks leading from my mouth to my side burns; and across the jawline and chin. I am not what you would call overweight; although I could loose 10 pounds; but as a child I was. I know what is causing my horrible acne; yet no one (and believe me I have been to MANY doctors) has given me any solutions. I have tried birth control; topical/oral treatments for acne; laser hair removal; anything and everything (at one point rubbing pure aloe vera on my face); yet NOTHING has worked. These things have controlled the situation; until the new batch of hairs grow; I remove them (because I feel very uncomfortable with them); and then when they start growing back its the same process of acne; etc.. all over again. Can anyone relate to this? any reccomendations? treatments? I don't know what is worst; a face full of acne or a face full of hair as a female... or worst; a face with BOTH and the scars from having it happen over and over again (my current situation). HELP!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,things your mama never told you..... Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat. Effects on hepatocyte fine structure.Flaks B; Flaks A; Shaw AP. Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level; 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver; a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration; the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups; and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. However; significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally; 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium; which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.,2007,2009,57,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have a question about my recent heart cath. I was told I had no blockages just that my right coronary artery is very small and gets narrower the further down it goes. I don't know what that means and unfortunately I was very drowsy when the dr came in to tell me this as the sedated me for the cath. All I know is my Verapamil was increased to 240 mg and my Crestor was increased to 40 mg. Is this a normal finding or a potential problem? I think everything is ok as I was told that I'm just one of those women who have chest pain for no identifiable cause and all I need to do is follow up w/ my PCP. If it makes a difference I went to dr for chest pressure; sob and nausea. Hx of htn; high chol (398 the day befor cath); endothelial dysfunction. Strong family hx of early heart disease- mother died of MI age 59; father died of MI age 60; brother has CAD; CHF and had stent placed at age 35.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Greetings: My wife has been sick for about three months now and I am very concerned. Here is the sequence of events. 1) This summer she was in very good physical shape and feeling great. Due to ongoing PMS problems ( worse in the last 5 years ); she decided to see a Doctor specializing in this problem. This doctor is a strong believer in natural treatments. 2) The doctor placed her on natural progesterone cream and a whole series of vitamin suplements in August. This cause heavy bleeding in the second month. This has gone away. 3) My wife developed sinusitis in late september and had a bad time getting rid of it. She took one antibiotic and it worked but she stopped taking it too early and got the sinusitis back. She took a full course of another antibiotic and then a full course of a third antibiotic before she finally put this at bay; although I am not completely sure it is all gone even now. 4) During this time of sickness; the doctor said her thyroid levels were wrong and started her on a natural thyroid suplement. There is also talk of antibodies being too high and the term hypothyroidism used. She has been off work for 5 weeks; went back to work for one week; then has taken two more weeks off; and now still feels poorly and does not feel she can go back to work at this time. She is constantly week; has constant yeast infections; and is tired and sleepy. Here weight has been stable through all of this. CONTINUED .......,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 23yo and my husband and I got married in June of 2007. However we will have dated for 8 years in April this year....yes high school sweethearts :) My entire life I have had irregular periods. When I was younger I had extremely heavy flows and painful cysts on my ovaries. They put me on birth control when I was 15 or 16 to regulate my periods which helped emensly. I didnt miss a day of school after being on the pill due to my horrific periods. I went off the pill this past october and we have been trying to conceive since then. However I hadn't gotten my period until now since Christmas. It makes it kind of difficult to get pregnant huh?! :( So I went in to an OB dr. and he did some tests and he said my testosterone levels are slightly elevated and I might have PCOS. Ok; now at least I have a reason why we can't get pregnant and there are no periods. So he prescribed Provera and clomid to help us out. I took the pill for 10 days and on the 11th day i got my period which would be considered day 1 which was Saturday. So i started my clomid on monday (day 3) and will take it through day 5 (friday). My period started off kinda light but now it is in full force! Last night which yesterday morning was the first day i took clomid I got severly dizzy and lightheaded in the evening. I had to immediately sit down and couldn't open my eyes b/c everything was spinning. IS THIS NORMAL? I went to bed and woke up for work and felt dizzy all over again. I decided to stay home b/c I am an operating room nurse and it would be no good being dizzy and unable to function in a high stress environment like the OR. Will I get this dizzyness every day i take the clomid? Also; I go in to get blood drawn on day 21 to see if I've ovulated. Will that blood test also be able to tell if i'm pregnant at that point or is it too early? I'm so anxious and excited for day 21 to come. What are the chances I will get pregnant the first time around? My dr. gave me some tips to help the process and I've done them. I take a prenatal vitamin and have been since october with folic acid. I don't smoke; I don't drink; I limit my caffeine and I"m "destressing" my life. Any other thoughts. I hope you can shed some light on our situation.,2008,2008,23,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi there; put simply; my doctor suspects that the Vagus nerve has been damage during heart surgery last October. They believe this to be the case because I have been left with a high resting pulse rate. I also have a constant 'buzzing' nervous sensation across my chest and down my arms; that can get almost unbearable at times. I can feel my whole upper body trembling. Can someone tell me if this could also be due to the Vagus nerve damage? Also; do nerves really heal themselves or not? Can anyone recommend a herbal or vitamin remedy to help the healing process and / or to relieve me of the 'buzzing'? I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you.,2012,2012,36,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,OK. I went to this VERY nice Doctor in Anchorage. At first she let me know that she "THOUGHT" I had bad posture; was overweight and had carpal tunnel which was what was causing my pain - but that she was going to run some tests. I went back to the hotel thinking --- woohoooooo! I can lose 25 lbs --- I'll be a slimmer me... I'll sit up straight --- and I'll get those gellie keyboard thingies... Wooohooooo! I CAN FIX THIS.... Well - she ruled out Rheumatoid Arthritis --- and she ruled out carpal tunnel... (I noticed she didn't rule out the overweight stuff.... Sigh... Ah well... darn...) It kind of left me in a slump - because I'm feeling horrible pains... Anyhow - after much (MUCH MUCH MUCH) testing --- and still waiting on more bloodwork to rule out all other AutoImmune Disorders - she's determined that it's all in my head... Whoa --- what?????? LMAO! OK - it's not in my head... It's in my cells to be more precise. Neurons; methinks is the exact word. Anyhow --- something either VERY MUCH like Fibromyalgia - Neuropathic Pain receptor distribution.... Kinda like a car that emits too many sparks from it's plugs... That my pain receptors are on Maximum overdrive. This is all a "preliminary diagnosis" at this point (as we all know things are always "up in the air" in the medical industry) and that I am waiting on more blood tests and some other results. She prescribed Lyrica and Cymbalta... (Lyrica is a pain receptor "blocker" and Cymbalta is an antidepressant that ALSO assists with the receptor blocking --- but on the serotonin level... I'm not depressed; thank goodness; but she said the combination of the 2 seemed to work the best for her other patients... but that each person is different...) Now ---- I haven't taken them yet - I'm waiting until tonight or so to see if they make me too drowsy. I'm not too certain of these drugs - but she did check for HEPATIC problems with it. So far; none that she could find. Anyhow; I'm to call her if these don't work in a couple of weeks. And she'll call me if there are any other problems. I'm a bit confused - because I'm not sure why I should be feeling neuropathic pain that "doesn't" exist... But she tried to explain it like this: Person "A" stubs toe --- feels pain at level "1" I stub toe and I'm ready to be shot to be put out of my misery. LMAO! That's about right - I'm definitely more sensitive to pain than your average person... but your typical aches and pains? Weird... So if I get a sore shoulder from sitting too long in one position --- to me that translates to "AN ELEPHANT HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY SHOULDERS". Now -- the interesting thing here is that I think HCV individuals are more likely to have Neuropathic pain than your average person. So --- with that in mind - methinks Fibromyalgia is coming up to my diagnosis plate pretty soon. Well - at least I'm not dying at the moment -- there's always something to be thankful for!!!! LOL! Hugs to y'all... I just wanted everyone to know what was happening --- cause heck it was an interesting trip. Now --- questions... ANYONE know ANYTHING about LYRICA or CYMBALTA ---- good or bad? Have a splendid day folks! Meki,2007,2008,41,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,After 2 ER visits; 1 Urgent care visit and 7 visits with 3 doctors. I had zero resolve to why my feet were like blocks of ice and I was shivering; trembling; dizzy and constantly feeling like I was going to pass out. Body temp of 95. This started January 10th and by the time March rolled around; I could not even lift myself out of my bed; I was so weak. When they had no answers; they prescribed one antibiotic after the other. So in the course of 3 months I was given 5 different antibiotics. I told them I suspected my thyroid because years ago my health insurance actually allowed me to see a functional medicine practitioner and she had run labs on me; this was 2012 and she said I believe you are having trouble with your thyroid. She prescribed Nature throid and I filled the script and one week later; I was laid off from work. I did not take the medication as I did not have any one to guide me through it. When I began working again and was covered on a new health insurance plan I went to my primary physician ( the new insurance would not cover any visits to the functional medicine Dr) and I told him that my previous physician thought I had a thyroid problem. He ran the usual TSH and free T4 and said; nope you are fine. Fast forward to March 2017. I know I'm new here and you don't know me; but I am far from a drama queen. I am not over exaggerating when I say I truly believed I was dying. I've never been so weak in my life. I could barely breathe; I was so weak and so cold. I had zero strength. I live alone with no family so it was very frightening. I kept picturing the evening news announcing that a 54 yr old woman was found 5 days after she died alone in her home.; clutching a basal thermometer in her hands. Each day was getting worse and I was missing a ton of work. Finally bit the bullet and made the appt for the Dr. I had seen back in 2012; paying out of pocket. The appt was 03/15. For 4 days I could not even move from the futon. Out of shear desperation on 03/14 I took out that script I filled 5 years prior and I took 1/2 grain ( 1 pill) of that Nature throid she had prescribed me. Within 2 hours I could stand; 5 hrs later my body temp slowly started rising. I was not even close to well; but that little experiment told me my body needed whatever was in that tiny pill. Saw the Dr the next day and she gave me a new script for WP Thyroid and started me on 1/2 grain and told me to raise by 1/4 grain every 3 to 4 days to tolerance. On 04/03 I reached the 1.5 grain mark. Below are my lab results taken 03/15/17. Then taken 6 weeks later on 04/26/16 to reflect numbers while on a low dose of thyroid medication. In that 6 wks I have researched everything under the sun about all of this and tried to plan my course of action. I have multiple medical issues; type 2 diabetes; kidney stones; fatty liver; was tested back in 2014 for Cushings due to swollen adrenal glands found during my pap smear. Tests did not indicate Cushings per the endo. Who knows. I've been well aware of the major inflammation due to high C Reactive tests. Seems it's pretty standard for us Syndrome X patients to have most of these issues. I've tested vitamin levels; female hormones; saliva cortisol. None are normal. When I posted my first set of labs to the STTM ( stop the thyroid madness) facebook page. They told me I should not be on any medication. They said my thyroid showed it was working and until all the other issues are resolved I should not be on any medication. They said it would kill my thyroid. I was so upset because without that medication I could not have returned to work. I don't have the luxury of staying home and healing adrenals as was suggested. I did contact my doctor and ask her if I was destroying my own thyroid by being medicated; she said she had never heard or read that. I had to take the chance. I need to know what my goal is after these results. Continue on low dose NDT and add T3 as I work on getting vitamins; liver; adrenals; sleep etc resolved? I am stable; but not well. Not looking to feel like wonder woman; but need to feel stronger. I have an appt scheduled next week to meet the Dr and I need to know if I ask for an increase in NDT or to add T3? She is the only Dr here in town that will prescribe these medications and I think she is expecting me to guide her some as to the STTM protocol although I'm not sure that is hand's down the authority on this. I've found more useful information in this forum; then I have found there. I apologize for the length of this. My labs are posted below with ranges. 03/15/17 ( Before Meds) TSH 1.370 Range 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL free T3 3.5 Range 2.0-4.4 pg/mL free T4 1.30 Range 0.82-1.77 ng/dL RT3 21.5 Range 9.2-24.1 ng/dL TPO 13 Range 0-34 Thyroglobin AB <1.0 Range 0.0 to 0.09 Lab results 04/26/17 ( after 6 wks on low dose NDT) Ranges are same as listed above TSH = 0.815 free T3 = 3.0 free T4= 1.01 RT3 = 16.4 TPO= 13 Thyroglobulin AB <1.0,2017,2017,54,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 25 year old female; weighing 240 lbs. I went to the hospital last week with my asthma and they said ended taking my blood sugar because the sugar strip for my pregancy test turned brown. My blood sugar was 541. They kept me for both my asthma and the blood sugar; and ran some tests. my a1c was 7.7 which i am told is very high. They diagnosed me with type 2 diabetes. They think if i loose weight i might not need medication in the end. They sent me home on metformin and glypuride. Question 1: we splurged and had chinese food the other night at a buffet (but i still watched what I ate) I took my medication like i was supposed to and then went to walmart. We were at the buffet for at least an hour; so it was about an hour after i ate when we were walking around walmart i became very pale; felt really light headed; and very sick to my stomach. I thought maybe i ate to much; I took my blood sugar and it had dropped to 60. It was 126 before dinner. So what happened? I am so confused. Question 2: I feel kinda lost about the ranges I should be at. They said when I get up in the morning it should be between 70 and 120. Pre-meal (which is when I am supposed to test) should be 130 and under and if i ever test after a meal (2 hours) it should be 180 and under. Then they said to be careful it doesn't get to low. what is considered low. I know 60 is. Question 3: This kinda go with the last question. last night i took the wrong bus and ended up acouple a towns up from where I live. I ended waiting at the police department waiting for a ride home. I started feeling really light headed; and i had a fast heart beat. I thought maybe my blood sugar was getting low again since the last time i ate was at 2 and at this point it was 9 pm. When I checked my blood sugar it read 102; which i didn't think was low... any ideas on what was going on? Question 4: Last question; I promise. I just want to make sure my numbers are looking okay cause like I said; Im confused.all numbers are pre-meal unless stated otherwise. Friday 10- @7:41 am: 60 @6:34 pm: 166 (2 days after the hospital last day on stariods for asthma) Sat. 11- @7:58 am: 56 @9:35 pm: 136 Sun 12- @7:05 am: 72 @10 pm: 113 Mon 13- @7:45 am: 49 @4:09 pm: 105 @9:47 pm: 80 Tues 14- @7:22 am 87 @5:55 pm: 126 (this was the night it dropped to 60 around 7 pm) Wed 15- @7:24 am 81 @7:23 pm: 129 (stopped taking glypuride thought it could be the cause of drops) Thurs 16- @7:45 am: 86 @9 pm: 102 This morning at 7:50: 104 I appreciate any help and I am sorry for asking so many questions. I was gave as many details as possible cause I saw thats what someone suggested. Thanks again.,2010,2010,24,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am type 2 diabeteic patient. Due to skipping meal; I developed adrenaline stress and by diamicron metformin But blood sugar was never high. Doctor gave me Lantus and Humalog. It was working well for a year. Then blood was becoming high; Doctor gave me LEVEMIR. If I take 10 units of humalog; after two hours sugar drops 4 points; I think this is the right dose for humalog for what I eat. I eat 60 gram Carb every meal. But 3 hours; sugar tries to go low; but insead; it bounces back and proceede to values and I start to feel hypo; though I never see sugar 9. It is not hypo value; why sugar bounces up; why feel shaky; fear etc. I use LEVIMIR as base insulin. Why body is obstructing sugar to low; and why it gives hypo feeling. Can any body me the reason and how to overcome this situation? My sugar is going high now. MATIN,2009,2013,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm 38 years old; female; with IBS (constipation) and chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia. I also have Type 2 Diabetes which is very well under control (a1c has been 6.0 or below for the last couple of years). I have high cholesterol which is now under control with simvastatin and lopid. I take Lyrica for Fibro and Metformin for diabetes. I take acidophilus; fiber (Benefiber); and stool softeners with laxatives every single day for my constipation. (my other meds are: flexeril due to chronic very tense muscles in my upper back; shoulders; and neck; meclizine for vertigo; requip for restless leg syndrome; Imitrex for migraines; ativan for anxiety and luvox for OCD/skin picking. I was on amitriptiline for headaches but stopped that a few days ago to limit exacerbation of constipation. I also have asthma but don't have very much trouble with it... i have a Pro-Air inhaler if needed) A few months ago (in April); I started having severe abdominal pain. Through April; May; and until early June; I went to the emergency room 4 or 5 times due to severe pain. Towards the end of things; the pain was a level 9+. Well; I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome with constipation. I also have chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia and several other conditions (including plantar fasciitis and bursitis and severe lower back pain). My Fibromyalgia doctor prescribed Vicodin for me to use for my pain. Well; unbeknownst to me; Vicodin compounds constipation. I started having severe abdominal pain and so I would take more vicodin. It would ease the pain until it wore off; then it would come right back and I'd take vicodin again. This would last about 10 to 14 days until even the vicodin couldn't ease my pain and I'd have to go to the E.R. I would get a diagnosis of constipation; be given an enema and magnesium citrate and sent home. I was stubborn and wouldn't believe that constipation could cause such extreme pain so I kept using the vicodin and consequently kept ending up back in the E.R. Finally; after my June 10th visit to the E.R.; I grew a brain and stopped using the vicodin. I started taking Acidophilus; Benefiber; and Stool Softeners with Laxatives every day. Because I didn't have anything for the pain; I went through HORRIBLE pain for about 6 days before the pain finally eased. I continue to take the meds for constipation every day and my tummy doesn't feel nearly as bloated or full and I'm a little more regular than I was. Here's the thing; when I was going to the E.R. all those times; I had some general all over pain; but the MAJORITY of my pain was in my upper abdomen... like between my ribs in that place where you'd get the wind knocked out of you or someone would do the heimlich... in that area or just below it. Pushing on that place hurts... and I've discovered that pushing on the upper right area hurts too. Where the constipation pain seems to be mostly gone; this upper abdominal pain continues; though it's more moderate than severe. Over the past several years; I've had slightly elevated liver enzymes on and off. Testing showed nothing wrong with my liver so because I'm obese (around 225 lbs... down from 260 lbs the end of last year); she said it was probably just "fatty liver". Well; one of the times I was in the E.R. (back in April); my blood test for my pancreas levels came back a little elevated. They admitted me to the hospital just in case it was pancreatitis and did an ultrasound which came back negative. I've had ultrasounds a couple of times on my gallbladder and no stones were found. I have looked all over the internet for the past couple of months trying to find something that was close enough to my symptoms but didn't find anything. Well today I found something called "Sphincter of Oddi"... which an online doctor mentioned a month ago but I didn't know what it was and thought it was just a typo or difficulty with English. Well; it turns out that I have several symptoms that track with SOD. Here's a list: -- pain is (postprandial?) worse after eating (seems to ease during times of clear liquid diet) -- consistent pain and tenderness in upper abdomen; middle and to the right. -- have had occasional slightly elevated liver enzymes -- have had one blood test return a mildly elevated pancreatic level -- ultrasound for gallstones negative -- return of acid reflux (approx 3 mos ago) after being "cured" approx 5 or 6 years ago after a period of taking Cimetidine -- daily mild to moderate nausea that strongly interferes with my eating habits (I usually only eat once a day due to nausea)... have lost around 30 lbs or more since the end of last year (Nov/Dec 2008) with no change in activity level... just lack of eating regularly. -- Only 1 episode of vomiting. Woke up one morning; sat up on the bed for a few minutes; then started vomiting. But I've had MANY episodes of very overwhelming nausea; however I have a very strong control of my gag reflex... can stick my fingers WAY down my throat and not even begin to gag. So I don't know if that's why I haven't been vomiting. -- very tired; can't get enough sleep So I'm wondering could it be SOD? Obviously it's not a severe case... my pain lately is mild to moderate; but pretty much constant every day. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions or questions? If you need more info; just ask. I don't get offended and am not easily embarrassed. I'm an open-book. I just want some ideas. I've had abdominal problems since I was a pre-teen... I used to have problems with gas getting locked up inside and couldn't release it and it caused excruciating pain. Those phases would last for HOURS; and usually happened at night. That lasted til I was in my mid 20's. My primary doctor is now finally trying to get me in to a GI doctor; but apparently there's only 1 in this area so he's booked I guess. Thanks for reading my long; novel-sized post. =) Holly,2009,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am white; and I have dark skin discoloration under my arms and in the vaginal area. It is embarrassing to me to even go to the doctor to ask about it because it looks "dirty". Is there any way that I can fix this problem or is it normal?,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I wanted to know if anyone else with fibro has pain in their feet. I have severe pain in my feet which is brought on by walking. Can't walk too long before it sets in. Was told it was plantar fascitis. Went to a podiatrist who said it was tarsal tunnel. Went to orthopedic surgeon who said it wasn't that. He did x-rays; an MRI and nerve tests and all showed NOTHING! He said there seemed to be nothing wrong and couldn't help. Just wondering if in some way it could be connected to my fibro.,2010,2010,41,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Okie-Dokie; It took me 6 months to get this together; but I've finally got the 2nd round of Tx going again. Here is a brief overview of round 1: 51 year old Caucasian male Genotype 1a Grade 2; stage 3/4 254 lbs Diabetes M. type 2 Dx with HCV 12/04 Treated with Pegasys/ Copegus total 56 weeks; from 2/05 through 3/06. Slow viral response at 12 week assay; so increased riba from assigned 1200 mg/day to 1800 mg/day. Became undetectable to <50 IU by week 20. Relapsed within 30 days post Tx. I started round 2 on 9/15/06 with Peg-Intron 0.50 mL/150 mcg/week; and ribavirin 2000 mg/day. For the first three injections; I've been drawing up the entire contents of the IFN vial; after reconstituting with 0.70 mL of the supplied diluent. This has given me an extrapolated dosage of 202 mcg Peg-Intron/week; based on a 0.68 mL injection. Although this IFN dosage isn't officially sanctioned by my new doctor; I have an appointment this Tuesday; and I'll disclose at that time. My three-week labs should be available for review by then; and hopefully will show some positive trends; if not; there's always dose reduction... :-). Subjectively; I feel fine after three injections; no side effects have shown themselves yet; however this is still *way* early in the game. Last treatment; I was good until week 9 or 10 before this cr@p started creeping up on me; so I guess time will tell the story. It's probably worth mentioning that I've made some changes regarding exercise and diet as well. As a diabetic; it's important that I maintain tight blood glucose control- particularly while on treatment. Over the last six months; I've managed to lose approx. 50 lbs; walking 8 miles daily in the hills here along with removing most processed foods as well as meats (salmon only now!) from my meals has been really helpful. More and more evidence is suggesting that obesity and insulin resistance are both negative prognostic indicators for SVR; so we'll see if this has any effect in the long run. I don't expect to be posting very actively; however that just might change if these meds begin slowing me down. Until then; I'm trying to stay as active as possible. I think attitude is an effective tool for Sx; during my last treatment; I resigned myself to the fact that I'd get sick from these meds. This time; I'm going to keep going until I get Gumby-Legs and can't walk... In other words; if the side-effects knock the door off the hinges; I guess they're coming in; however; I'm not going to wait around for them. My very best to all those folks that I recognize from days past; in addition to a whole lot of new ones as well. Keep plugging away at this stuff; and we'll eventually prevail-- Bill,2005,2006,51,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Impact of Obesity on Hepatitis C and Treatment of HCV By Liz Highleyman It is increasingly clear that obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities play a role in the progression of liver disease and poor response to hepatitis C treatment. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions including insulin resistance and elevated blood fat levels -- is associated with steatosis (fatty liver); which in turn is linked with more severe liver fibrosis and a greater risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As reported in the May 2006 issue of Gastroenterology; for example; a meta-analysis of data from more than 3;000 patients at 10 clinics in Italy; Switzerland; France; Australia; and the United States found that steatosis was "significantly and independently" associated with fibrosis in people with chronic HCV infection; and that addressing metabolic factors "appears important in the management of chronic hepatitis C." Similarly; a study presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2006 conference in May confirmed the link between steatosis and liver disease progression. In a retrospective review of medical records from 223 chronic hepatitis C patients; researchers observed a significant relationship between steatosis and fibrosis; leading them to suggest that; "Efforts to control steatosis may therefore have an important role in halting HCV liver disease progression; particularly in persons who are non-responders to antiviral therapy." How Do Obesity and Metabolic Factors Promote Liver Damage? The mechanisms by which obesity and metabolic abnormalities promote steatosis and fibrosis are not well understood; but inflammation; autoimmunity; and altered levels of cytokines and hormones such as leptin and adiponectin may play a role. A study reported in the April 2006 Journal of Hepatology showed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels -- and whether ALT decreased with successful treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin -- were associated with markers of the metabolic syndrome; including high body mass index and elevated blood pressure; blood glucose; and blood fat levels. The authors concluded that ALT elevation (a marker for liver inflammation) "partially depends on the degree of derangement of fat and carbohydrate metabolism." In the June 2006 issue of Hepatology; researchers from the Mayo Clinic reviewed mechanisms that may explain the link between obesity and liver disease progression. Fat tissue secretes hormones called adipokines (including leptin and adiponectin) that regulate metabolism of glucose and lipids in the liver; and also modulate immune activity. Some adipokines promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Leptin appears to activate signaling pathways in hepatic stellate cells that contribute to inflammation and fibrogenesis. Obesity can cause insulin resistance; which promotes the accumulation of fat in liver cells; HCV; too; appears to directly induce insulin resistance; so obese patients with hepatitis C may have an additive effect. Oxidative stress related to inflammation; as well as elevated insulin levels; may interfere with interferon-signaling pathways. Finally; excess fat tissue reduces the amount of circulating interferon in the body during treatment; possibly due to impaired absorption after injection. Different HCV genotypes seem to be associated with steatosis through differing mechanisms. Genotype 3 HCV appears to directly promote the build-up of fat in liver cells; while steatosis in genotype 1 patients appears to be linked with co-existing metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance. Management of Obesity The Mayo Clinic researchers reported that reducing body weight and improving underlying metabolic factors may help "overcome the low sustained viral response rates observed in obese patients infected with HCV." The first-line approach to managing obesity involves lifestyle modification; including exercise and a healthy; balanced diet. Weight loss has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity; lower ALT levels; and improve liver histology. If such measures are not adequate; anti-diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glucophage); pioglitazone (Actos); and rosiglitazone (Avandia) may also be used to increase insulin sensitivity; which may help reduce fat accumulation in the liver. While these medications have not yet been studied extensively in people with hepatitis C; there is data suggesting that they are associated with reduced ALT and improved liver histology in HCV negative patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The authors also suggested that use of higher doses of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for extended periods might help overcome the lower response rates observed in obese patients. Weight-based dosing and longer treatment durations are currently the subject of considerable research; but the authors also suggested higher dosing based on levels of insulin resistance or amount of visceral fat; rather than body weight alone. Together; these studies suggest that liver disease progression should be considered among the deleterious outcomes of obesity and the metabolic syndrome; along with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 7/28/06 References G Leandro; A Mangia; J Hui; and others.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Feb of 2004 as a result of being rushed to the emergency room in the middle of one night. I had awoken with incredible pain in my legs. The pain was the most horrible I had ever felt and having had problems with migraines in my youth; I knew what severe pain felt like. This was far worse. It was so bad; I was begging God to kill me. I'm going to shorten the story here because it is very long with all the details included. Besides the diabetes; I was also diagnosed with severe peripheral neuropathy. A checkup a year before showed no indication of diabetes. I had intermittent leg pain since my late teens that aspirin always took care of. Aspirin was of no help this time. Now jumping forward to 2008. Since shortly after being diagnosed I would experience periodic blackouts/pass outs/fall asleep or whatever you call them. These occur virtually every day; some days worse than others and they last for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes each. I have no clue when one happens. I just wake up and realize one occurred. Sometimes they come in strings; one right after another and there are most frequent when I have not slept well. I am only able to sleep 2 to 3 hours at a time; I then wake up and am wide awake. So; I usually end up taking about 3 naps each day rather than a normal 8 hours straight. They can occur anywhere. I have even had 2 episodes occur while standing in front of the toilet; taking a leak. My neurologist declared me permanently disabled in Feb of 2005. My illness has continued to worsen over the years to where I now have difficulty walking and am very unsteady on my feet. I have almost no feeling at all below the waist and everything below the knees is completely numb. I am now starting to have numbness and pain in my hands; particularly my pinkies. I have had muscles spasms almost since the time I was diagnosed. They were nothing extraordinary. However; in the last several months; I have starting to have what I call "violent body spasms". Almost every time I lay down to go to sleep; as soon as I start to drift off; one of the body spasms strikes. The ones that occur in bed happen either in my legs or the middle of my back. It feels like someone has kicked me in the back as hard as they can and it almost throws me out of the bed. When they occur in my legs; its like kicking a football; fast and hard. So hard that my legs kick out violently. These attacks also occur during the day. For example; I had one just before I started this message. While sitting here; both legs kicked out so hard; I was pushed backwards; away from the desk and it felt like a bolt of electricity had shot through both knees; causing a great deal of pain. I currently take 100mg of morphine twice a day and a 60 mg dose as a bridge in between; for the pain in my legs. I also take Lyrica; 150mg 3 times a day as well Citalopram at 40mg per day. I also take Glipizide and Metformin for the diabetes. These spasms concern me as they seem to be getting stronger and more violent. They aren't true body spasms as they only occur in specific places and have never actually occurred all over my body at once. They are very weird sometimes. I have raked everything off my desk when the spasm causes my arms to flail out wildly. I have actually slugged myself in the jaw on several occasions when the spasm occurred in my right arm. It wasn't an accident either. I have actually seen my hand come up; make a fist; and then hit me in the chin or jaw. It all happens so fast though that by the time my brain realizes what is going on; it is done. Its almost like I am possessed or something and someone else is directing my appendages. Does anyone have any idea what is going on with me?,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have suffered with chronic muscle pain; muscle knots and horrible fatigue on and off for 5 years. I have acid reflux; PCOS; hypothyroidism; insulin resistance; high cholesterol; chronic diarrhea/constipation....if it isn't one it is the other. I have trouble sleeping and many nights may only get 3-4 hrs of sleep; even with muscle relaxers. My primary physician believes I have fibromyalgia; he sent my to a rheumatologist. The rheumy did not even take a health history! I told him my symptoms which had recently worsened. I was experiencing spasms and twitching in my legs and feet; along with numbness. My toes have a bluish/purple cast to them and are ice cold year round. My knees have gotten to the point where going up stairs is difficult. The back of my knees hurt horribly when I sit with them bent at a 90* angle or when standing for extended periods of time. The only exam the rheumy did was to push on my stomach; he did not want to see my feet. I have PCOS and take a lot of meds. due to that condition. I gave him a med list and the first med listed was Metformin ....shouldn't his first question have been; "Are you diabetic?" especially with feet and legs going numb and poor circulation in my feet. I am at my wits end; I am depressed about my health; I am only 38 yrs old and the mother of 4 boys. Along with the fibro type symptoms; I have chronic kidney infections and have become allergic to macrobid and sulfa. Ibuprofen gives me NO relief; tylenol makes it dull down some. I feel like a hypochondriac...going to the dr.... tests show nothing...but my pain and fatigue never stop. Some days are much better than others; but none are close to pain free. I work as a hygienist 3 days a week....after 8 hrs sitting with my elbows up to my shoulders and making repetitive motions all day; well I am wiped out; in pain; depressed that there seems to be no help on the horizon. I am not a weak person; I carried twin boys to 38 wks ...spent 2 days in labor. I delivered 2 healthy boys with a combined weight of almost 15 lbs. That was 7 yrs ago...my boys deserve a mom who isn't sick all the time. The amount of time and money and missed work trying to get a diagnosis may lead to having to snger be able to keep pushing my body; taking care of everyone else first. ell my home; possibly my job (I am the only hygienist in my office) I went thru the same thing with PCOS...I researched and diagnosed myself after believing that something was wrong....and when they ran the correct test; bingo; I had a problem...it wasn't in my head. I don't have the energy to pursue this the way I did PCOS; and because I don't look sick; I am to suck it up and go along. I am lost..just lost. AJ,2011,2011,38,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I went to the gyno for the first time in august and he did a regular exam but i also had itchiness and swelling. then he told me he was going to take a culture for herpes because i had a few cuts inside my vagina. I had had sex for the first time a few days before and it was very dry(im thinking what may have made the cuts). I few days later i got the test results back that i had a yeast infection and then i few days from them i found out that my herpes culture was negative. About 2 months after that i had the same symptoms itching and swelling and i had a 2 cuts at the top of my outlabia. almost in my public hair region. I went to a gyno at school and she told me that it didnt look like herpes at all and that i should be fine; it was just another yeast infection. the cuts were gone in less than a day. I dont know if it was because i was extra cautious and still thought i had herpes but i always feel like im irriated down there. i went home that weekend to my regular gyno and he told me i had nothing to worry about. About a month after the 2nd yeast infection i had another cut right where my pubic hair meets my outer labia.again went away in less than a day. and i have still been experiencing irriation it feels like. so my question is does anyone experience cuts with yeast infections. because my doctor said it was common. but i am still convinced i have herpes. and my boyfriend doesnt understand why i wont touch him anymore. i am going to get blood tested for herpes on thursday but i have a feeling my doctor is going to tell me its unnecessary.,2005,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I find myself getting really tired sometimes when I eat; I just feel horribly drained and can barely keep my eyes open; most times I can't fight it and end up taking a nap. It's getting to the point where some days I'm in bed more than I'm awake; which I know is obviously not good for me. I find it usually happens when I eat pasta or soup with crackers; so I'm guessing it's sugar/carbs related. I can't afford to cut these things out of my diet as I'm on unemployment right now and can barely afford pastas and soups as it is; I'd love to be able to eat lots of vegatables but I can't afford them and they don't last long enough even if I could. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening? It's getting to the point where I have to choose to either be starving all day or exausted all day. Does anyone have any tips they can lend me? Thanks; H,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I've joined this forum on behalf of my 56 y/o husband who has HCV which has progressed to stage 4 cirrhosis. He is developing other complications like splenomegaly and portal hypertension; etc. He attempted tx in '03 for 3 months and had to stop due to the stress of work (was a home builder) and the side effects. (developed diabetes shortly afterwards-I think the 2 are related) Anyway; he has genotype 1a and was responding to the Inf/Rib tx; but it was all just to much to handle at once. He was then a stage 2 cirrhosis so in 7-8 years; it has doubled. We have recently been discussing the standard tx with a Tyler TX doc. I came across the teleprevir a few years ago on the internet and then again the other day in a NY Times Magazine article from the summer. I emailed the California doc in the article and he said I needed to check into the trials at the Liver Institute at Methodist Dallas and also Parkland Hospital as the drug would not be available till summer 2011 and also get evaluated for transplantation. I did find a trial which seemed suitable and registered but am not sure what to do next. The Liver Institute seems to be looked upon favorably and I'm not impressed with the attention/concern from the Tyler; TX doc. Should have Medicare in January with a supp policy but won't have $ for all of the gaps! The California doc also mentioned a Dr. Ghalib in Arlington she used to work at Methodist. Things seem to be deteriorating faster than I expected and I really want a better shot at success than the 40-50% SVR that the standard INF/Rib offers. We were told that there is also a chance the tx could precipitate liver failure and with his advanced cirrhosis; that scares the shi$ out of me! Could really use some input from some of you who "have the t-shirt". I feel we've really wasted some critical time and had no idea things could progress this quickly. So any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated as I feel we are running out of time.,2010,2010,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. This is somewhat complicated. Sorry in advance. I am a 49 y.o. Hispanic Female; Obese; with Type 2 diabetes. I take metformin 1 gram bid; and an ARB for renoprotection. I have hypothyroidism; and I take Synthroid daily. I had a lap Chole in 2001. I am lactose intolerant. I have had diarrhea since 2001 on and off; esp. after a large or fatty meal; or after dairy product intake. Lots of mucus is present at times. I sometimes have mild and intermittent RUQ abdominal pain. Pain does not change with position change; but will be slightly worse after a meal. Pain does not radiate; but at times I have a feeling that can best be compared to having an inflated balloon under my rib cage in the back on the right. It's not pain...it just feels abnormal. No nausea; no vomiting; no jaundice; no weight loss. **No** constipation; ever. All non-diarrheal bowel movements are thin or ribbon like. I had 2 CT scans of the abdomen; an abdominal ultrasound; and an amylase (no lipase) a year and a half ago. All were normal. One month ago; I had an upper endoscopy; which noted GERD with esophageal erosions. I also had a colonoscopy; which noted a polyp; which was determined to be benign. Also; there was diverticulosis. No cultures or stool for O&P have been done. The gastroenterologist prescribed Colestid; and Librax; Aciphex and a fiber supplement. He also prescribed a low lactose/high fiber diet; and the usual lifestyle modifications for GERD. I am complying with my treatment. (Well; OK; I cheat sometimes and take lactase tablets before I have cheese.) The problem is: with all of this; I still have had no change. The GERD is somewhat better; but the diarrhea/thin/flat stools are still present. The abdominal pain is still present. I do not feel overly comfortable with my GI guy. I am really at my wit's end; to be putting my story here for the world to see. So please; if you can; give me some ideas. Thanks in advance.,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,So I already know that I have PCOS; but my mom and grandma both had severe endo! I have researched both conditions; but PCOS never talks about chronic pain before;during and after menstruating; and pain during and after intercourse. My bowels are very messed up and I get really bad pain in my rectum. That is where my mom had a lot of it. I have no idea. None of my docs will do laparascopy. I have only had one U/S and a very long sharp vaginal probe; I forget what that is called. My blood clots are gigantic and never ending. I need some input from you intelligent ladies!!! I have been on the pill for 8 days now and can feel my cysts filling and popping! So much relief afterwards though. Bethany,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PCOS about two weeks ago. I've been plagued with hirsutism since I was 12 years old and I'm now 36 and I was always diagnosed with idiopathic hirsutism because my total testosterone was normal; my glucose was normal; my menstruation was very regular; I was not overweight; etc.; etc. I always believed that there was something wrong and my physicians just weren't savvy enough to figure it out. Years passed and I decided to get checked again because I've gained 30 lbs over two years (due to taking prednisone for the hives I got daily because of Hashimoto's) and the male pattern hair growth increased. I'm now 5'6" and 167lbs. I sought the help of an endocrinologist and he ordered a lot of blood tests. I never had problems with elevated glucose and the test showed that my fasting glucose was 102; slightly elevated. My free testosterone was elevated also which explained the excessive hair on my chin; neck; chest; stomach and thighs. I haven't had problems with fertility because I have two children who were conceived with no difficulty because my periods had always been like clock work. I was surprised at the diagnosis but relieved to find out that there was a known medical term for my symptoms. I have very bad depression and panic attacks and I've had them for 18 years now. Does anyone know if there is a link between PCOS and clinical depression? Also; is there anyone else out there with Hashimoto's thyroiditis along with PCOS. I'm going crazy with depression; hirsuitism; pelvic pain; panic attacks; excess weight; slight acne; oily skin; fatigue; etc. If anyone has these symptoms please tell me what treatment you've sought and what has helped you if anything. Thanks and good luck.,2007,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone; I hope all is well. I was just diagnosed with PCOS although I've had symptoms of it since I was 12 (hirsutism) and I am now 36. My hirsutism was diagnosed as idiopathic because the testing I had did not indicate an elevated testosterone level. I don't know if the testing is more sophisticated now but I had new testing done and it did indicate that my free weak testosterone was elevated. Anyway; I have a few hairs under my chin; a lot on my neck; chest; stomach; and inner thighs. I know...it's not attractive and very depressing. I pluck (which is not good for you and causes hyperpigmentation) and I shave. I've become very skilled at covering the hyperpigmentation up with concealer but I'm so tired of it. The plucking on my neck has caused so much hyperpigmentation that I have to conceal it or people would look at me and ask me; "What's wrong with your neck?" The skin on my chest also has hyperpigmentation and I only shave this area. I feel like a freak every time I shave my chest because I'm a woman and I'm a woman who loves makeup; clothes; fashion; shoes; etc. It just seems so wrong! If I wear low cut blouses I have to try to conceal the hyperpigmentation but it's difficult because the skin is not completely smooth and it looks like I've shaved so I'm always on the search for really nice big necklaces that would cover this part of my chest. It's difficult being me!! If anyone can relate to me send me a message and let me know your struggle or what you've done to help this problem. It was difficult for me to share this because although I know it has to do with having PCOS and I did not cause this to happen; it still is embarrassing. Also; I don't want to seem superficial or extremely vain because I do have other health concerns that are potentially much more damaging than the aesthetic ramifications of hirsutism but I just want to know if other African-American women are experiencing this because our skin is slightly different.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This has been a kind of stressful weekend for me in part because of what was going on with me and also my friend Dave. This is also a kind of rant against the VA hospital here that both of us get our health care through. For those who don't know about my friend Dave he is my only friend here and his health is a lot worse than mine. Due to several hernias he gets intestinal blockages fairly often but usually waits too long before calling for an ambulance and usually requires emergency surgery to save his life. Friday he called me to say he was sick again and I was able to get him to let me call for an ambulance this time. It turns out that was probably the only good thing to happen all weekend. Normally it takes only about 15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive but for some reason they changed who covers where we live. As a result it took 45 minutes for them to arrive and I had to talk to the ambulance company to tell them how to find us. That sure doesn't bode well for us the live in this area. Dave later told me that the driver is a speed demon and it was the fastest trip he ever made to Columbia and that the paramedic in the back with him kept telling the driver to slow down. Once they got him stabilized at the hospital in Columbia that VA had them transfer him up to the VA hospital in Nashville and that is where the real nightmare started. By this time it had been over 12 hors since he had anything to eat or drink and being a diabetic he knew his Glucose was getting very low. He told the ER doctor about the diabetes but they would not give him anything because they were trying to decide if he would be needing surgery or not. Finally after several more hours they had decided that they would try to clear the blockage via medicines and enemas and not surgery so they transfered him to the ward. As so as he got there he told the nurse he was diabetic so they checked his glucose. It was so low he was almost to the point of going into a coma and he was really losing it mentally. They literally pours two glasses of sugar water down his throat and his glucose started to come back up. Once his mind was starting to work again they asked him why he hadn't told the ER he was diabetic. But of course he had! Then they came back into the room and pumped his stomach as they didn't know if he would need surgery or not. Next he had to fight with them over his diabetes again. They wanted to give him metformin which doesn't work and makes him violently ill instead of the insulin he has been on for about 6 months. They also refused to give him another of his regular medications because it is not on the formulary and was the weekend so they could not get approval for it. But he has a RX for this drug through the VA as it is the only drug that works for him. You would think that would be an automatic override on the formulary rules.! In the mean time I am taking care of his Lab Buddy while he is in the hospital as usual. Buddy is very dependent on Dave and gets depressed when he is not around. He doesn't eat or drink and the only way I can get him to eat is by playing catch with him a lot and bringing takeout food. When you are not use to playing catch with a dog it wears you out quickly and makes you sore. So I'm not sleeping very good due to pain. Sunday morning Dave calls me and says they are going to discharge him by noon so I head up to Nashville to pick him up. As my car is low on fuel I stop at a gas station to fill up. I end up standing there at the pump for 3 or 4 minutes because I can't remember how to get my gas tank lid open. You just push and it pops open but I don't remember that and am looking all over for a release. At this point I am beginning to think I should not make the drive as I had already stopped at a green light. My brain just is not functioning today. But how else is he going to get home so I head up to Nashville anyway. The rest of the trip up to Nashville was uneventful and no deer for me to see. Boo Hoo :( When I get to the hospital Dave tell me he is in a lot of pain and the thumb print system for dispensing pain meds at the VA is not working so no one is getting their pain medications. You would think they would have a key over ride so they can access the medication in case of system failure.! So Dave then asks the nurse how much longer until the paperwork for his release will be. He wants to get home as soon as he can so that he can take some of his pain medications. The nurse agrees with Dave that he was suppose to be released today but say the order isn't for today but tomorrow. Turns out that the nurse was thinking that today was the 7th instead of the 8th. Makes you wonder if the nurses are taking the pain medications themselves instead of giving them to patients for that kind of mistake. So instead of getting out of there by noon it was more like 1 before we left. The drive back home was murder on me. I had to stop to rest several times because my vision was getting very blurry; my legs were cramping up; and I was getting very sleepy. This makes the third time in a row that I have had a lot of trouble on the return drive from Nashville. I guess I should start looking for some other way to do my trips up there as each of the returns have been worse than the previous one. Well I guess that is about it for this grip session.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had my first child back in April of 2004 and had my tubes clamped in June. I was told not to have another child due to the fact I had a really hard pregnancy with my first. I wanted the dr to do a Tubal Ligation but instead he just clamped instead. Not too happy about that b/c I was told I could still get pregnant after the swelling in the tubes go down. I have been having symptoms of Pregnancy the past couple of weeks. I had my last period on December 27; 2004. I know that I am not supposed to start until this weekend but I have been having all of the symptoms of being pregnant again. I have had nausea; sore breasts (very sore); they are extremely sensitive; and I have the dark blue lines on them like I did before. I have just been feeling like I am pregnant and my husband told me not to worry about it.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Started my 5th therapy three weeks ago and feel 90% normal. Swim 12 lapse in the pool daily; great appetite; sleep eight hours and not angry. Could this be the answer? http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/12/AR2006091201444.html The Washington Post - Wednesday; September 13; 2006; Page A02 Marijuana can improve the effectiveness of drug therapy for hepatitis C; a potentially deadly viral infection that affects more than 3 million Americans; a study has found. The work adds to a growing literature supporting the notion that in some circumstances pot can offer medical benefits. Treatment for hepatitis C involves months of therapy with two powerful drugs; interferon and ribavirin; that have severe side effects; including extreme fatigue; nausea; muscle aches; loss of appetite and depression. Because of those side effects; many patients do not finish treatment and the virus ends up destroying their livers. Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco and at an Oakland substance abuse center tracked the progress of 71 hepatitis C patients taking the difficult therapy. Tests and interviews indicated that 22 smoked marijuana every day or two during the treatment period while 49 rarely or never did. At the end of the six-month treatment; 19 (86 percent) of those who used marijuana had successfully completed the therapy -- meaning they took at least 80 percent of their doses over at least 80 percent of the period. Only 29 (59 percent) of the nonsmokers achieved that goal. Similarly; 54 percent of the marijuana users achieved a "sustained virological response;" the gold standard goal of therapy; meaning they had no sign of the virus in their bodies six months after the treatment was over. That compared with only 18 percent of those who did not smoke pot. While it is possible that the marijuana had a specific; positive biomedical effect; it is more likely that it helped patients by reducing depression; improving appetite and offering psychological benefits that helped the patients tolerate the treatment's side effects; the team reports in the current issue of the European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology.,2001,2011,64,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Women who do not have enough vitamin B12 in their blood before and after conception have a greater chance of having a baby with brain or spinal cord defects; a new study says. Most at risk may be vegans and vegetarians; since B12 is far more common in meat and animal-based foods; noted an American and Irish research team whose findings were published in the March issue of Pediatrics.. According to the study; women with low levels of B12 had at least 2.5 times the risk of giving birth to a child with these neural tube defects; which can lead to partial paralysis or even death; than women with the highest B12 levels. "Vitamin B12 is essential for the functioning of the nervous system and for the production of red blood cells;" Dr. Duane Alexander; director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; said in a news release issued by its parent organization; the U.S. National Institutes of Health. "The results of this study suggest that women with low levels of B12 not only may risk health problems of their own; but also may increase the chance that their children may be born with a serious birth defect." Researchers analyzed blood collected during the early pregnancy stages of hundreds of women from Ireland; a country with a high rate of neural tube defects. Either the women had previously given birth to a baby with a neural tube defect or were known to be carrying babies with the disorder. Women with B12 concentrations below 250 ng/L before pregnancy had roughly three times the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect as those with higher B12 blood levels. Those women whose levels were less than 150 ng/L; which is considered B12 deficient; had five times the risk of women with higher levels. The researchers used statistical techniques to focus solely on B12 levels and factor out the role of folic acid; a nutrient known to help prevent pregnant women from birthing babies with neural tube defects. The study authors noted that B12 and folate are jointly linked to several key biochemical reactions; but that a lack of either B12 or folate increased the risk of a neural tube defect. While confirmation from other studies is needed; the authors suggested women should have vitamin B12 levels above 300 ng/L before becoming pregnant. Study co-author Dr. James L. Mills; a senior investigator in the NICHD division of epidemiology; statistics and prevention research; went further; recommending all women of childbearing age always consume the daily recommended amount of vitamin B12 and at least 400 micrograms of folic acid.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm diagnosed with 'early cirrhosis'. Six mos post treatment and virus free; my ALT/AST is 31/26. Here's what my docs says in response to my inquiry: <i>I'm happy with the current enzyme levels. Teens would be ideal but 20's is fine as well. I think you have a good chance of reversal of damage as I don't think your liver has passed "the point of no return". Time; of course; will tell.</i> I'm posting this because we have a few of us with similar damage levels and it might be of interest to the others. "The point of no return". It has an ominous ring; don't it? Also; a question for the gang about glucose. Mine is right on the cusp of out of range to the high side. When does it become an issue? Should I be concerned now? Should I be working on eliminating all refined sugar from the diet? What else?,2005,2006,47,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm wondering if I could get to advice as to how much Naturthroid to start verses my Levothyroxine. I have looked up the conversion from Naturthroid's website; but everyone says to go slow. I just had blood work done last Thursday (2-28-13). I haven't gotten the lab report yet; but hoping I will from my doctor's office today. I know I'm probably asking to soon before you have my new labs; but I am wanting to get some good advice . As of January 10; 2013; I had to titrate up from around 87 to 100 mcg. due to my labs done on that date. After about 4 weeks of taking the new dose I felt very hyper and requested to have labs done 2-28-13 (doctor wanted me to wait until 3-13-13; but I couldn't. I knew/know something is very wrong inside me right now. I am a bit of a wreck and after talking to a friend who takes Naturthroid; she suggested I take it rather than T4 only. She believes I have RT3 going on and says going on NTH will do me better; but I don't want to start to high on this combo T med. By the way; these are the Lab reports I am waiting on from my doctor's office: TSH; FT3; FT4; RT3. In addition; the doctor also ordered; which is really a waste of money and is redundant; the TSH reflex to abnormal FT4 (which it means; if the TSH is abnormal; test the FT4)! Sheesh; we were already testing the FT4 and TSH. My prior Labs were taken on 1-10-13 - 9 am at LabCorp (87 1/2 mcg) Doing the 75/100 every other day to average this amount (I only use 50 mcg tabs due to dyes): CBC With Differential/ Platelet WBC 8.5 4.0-10.5 x10E3/uL RBC 5.22 3.77-5.28 x10E6/uL Hemoglobin 15.0 11.1-15.9 g/dL Hematocrit 46.1 34.0-46.6 % MCV 88 79-97 fL MCH 28.7 26.6-33.0 pg MCHC 32.5 31.5-35.7 g/dL RDW 13.6 12.3-15.4 % Platelets 371 140-415 x10E3/uL Neutrophils 62 40-74 % Lymphs 31 14-46 % Monocytes 6 4-13 % Eos 0 0-7 % Basos 1 0-3 % Neutrophils (Absolute) 5.4 1.8-7.8 x10E3/uL Lymphs (Absolute) 2.6 0.7-4.5 x10E3/uL Monocytes(Absolute) 0.5 0.1-1.0 x10E3/uL Eos (Absolute) 0.0 0.0-0.4 x10E3/uL Baso (Absolute) 0.0 0.0-0.2 x10E3/uL Immature Granulocytes 0 0-2 % Immature Grans (Abs) 0.0 0.0-0.1 x10E3/uL Glucose; Serum 93 65-99 mg/dL BUN 14 6-24 mg/dL Creatinine;Serum 0.89 0.57-1.00 mg/dL eGFR If NonAfricn Am 73 >59 mL/min/1.73 eGFR If Africn Am 84 >59 mL/min/1.73 BUN/Creatinine Ratio 16 9-23 Sodium; Serum 140 134-144 mmol/L Potassium; Serum 4.6 3.5-5.2 mmol/L Chloride; Serum 100 97-108 mmol/L Carbon Dioxide; Total 23 20-32 mmol/L Calcium; Serum 10.3 (H) 8.7-10.2 mg/dL Protein; Total; Serum 7.4 6.0-8.5 g/dL Albumin; Serum 4.8 3.5-5.5 g/dL Globulin; Total 2.6 1.5-4.5 g/dL A/G Ratio 1.8 1.1-2.5 Bilirubin; Total 0.7 0.0-1.2 mg/dL Alkaline Phosphatase; S 91 25-150 IU/L AST (SGOT) 21 0-40 IU/L ALT (SGPT) 25 0-32 IU/L (I cut back on Calcium to only 1 pill daily instead of 3 - Doc was worried about me possibly getting kidney stones etc.) Other tests taken: TSH 8.220 (H) 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL T4;Free(Direct) 1.35 0.82-1.77 ng/dL FT3 2.6 2.0-4.4 pg/mL Vitamin B12 1221 (H) 211-946 pg/mL (I've heard this is okay being this high from research) Vitamin D; 25-Hydroxy 67.8 30.0-100.0 ng/mL (I increased an addt'l 2k IU) Iron Bind.Cap.

I will not take Statins...period) Of course; once I have my new labs as stated above; maybe someone can help me know where to start with NTH. My doctor will allow most likely; but she may not know how much I should start and how soon to titrate. I don't want to be more of wreck than I already am and have been for the past month! Thanks so much and hope someone with good knowledge can help me figure this out before my next doctor's appt; which I can get sooner than 3-15-13 (of course; I'm sure it will be based on my new labs of 2-28-13) Debi,2009,2013,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My daughter-in-law is experiencing unexplainable extreme heart rate elevation with normal exertion such as walking or standing from a seated position. Emergency room personnel recorded a jump from 98 BPM to 130-150 BPM upon standing from a seated position. Subject is 20 years old and in good health. Symptoms started shortly after eating breakfast on a cruise ship. Cruise ship medical personnel diagnosed anxiety as a possible cause; but hospital ultrasound and CBC discovered nothing significant. Yet the condition persists even when subject is under influence of doctor prescribed Xanax. What conditions might be causing this problem?,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 40-year-old female. This is a long story; but over the past couple of weeks; I have found myself unable to eat. I constantly feel like I've just eaten a huge plate of food or a rich dessert. It's that feeling like you just couldn't possibly eat one more bite. I've had occasional feelings like this over the past few months; but I started Metformin for type 2 diabetes and I thought it might be related. Well; it's certainly not normal to not be able to eat at all. Especially since I've been very heavy my whole life and to be honest; even when I had gallstone pancreatitis a few years back; never missed a meal. I have a very sore; distended abdomen and my left side hurts from top to bottom. A little background. I have a history of mainly right-sided abdominal pain; starting in early 2002. Occasional strange dizzy spells. Investigations (ultrasound; HIDA scan; etc) showed no gallstones and I was pretty much just told to live with it. A few years later; the pain had gotten a lot worse for me. I also had these weird brief squeezing sensations in my flank area. I just blew all of this off because the idea of having more tests and being told nothing was wrong was just too much for me. I finally broke down and saw another doctor at a teaching hospital. In 2007; a gastric emptying study; endoscopy/colonoscopy; another ultrasound showed nothing. I went back to living with the pain. My mother has Crohn's disease and she just lives with it; so I figured I could just wait for things to come to a head. Over the years I would occasionally spike a high fever (once up to 104) and that was followed by diarrhea for a couple of days; but otherwise I just dealt with it. Then I started having attacks of extreme pain. An abdominal CT revealed gallstones in 2009. I didn't have health insurance; so I couldn't afford surgery. I assumed that stones had been the problem all along and they just hadn't found them. In 2013; I had gallstone pancreatitis. I thought the surgery would fix it all. No more extreme attacks that last hours; It has been back to the same right-sided pain as before. My bathroom habits have been strange diarrhea attacks with cramping pain for 15 years or more. Doctors call it IBS. Again; I've learned to live with all of this because doctors have investigated everything pretty thoroughly. Over the past couple of years; things have changed. My symptoms have changed. The pain spreads on my right side more and more. This occasional squeezes on the right flank happen on both sides now. I sometimes have some pretty acute pain on my right side and strange soreness after being bloated and distended for several hours. I sometimes feel like I need to have a bowel movement but nothing happens. I have ovarian cysts that come and go; so I have been chalking a lot of this up to that situation. This is all so strange and I feel like weird telling people this whole story. I have a GI doctor; but he basically refuses to do more tests. Says it's IBS or sphincter of oddi type 3. All liver and pancreas numbers check out. When I stopped being able to eat; my stomach was more bloated and distended than ever before. I had the distinct soreness running from the top right across to the left and basically down my left side. When I take a deep breath; it hurts in my back on my left side. After two days of not being able to eat I went to the ER. They did a CT; collected all the usual blood. Absolutely nothing of interest showed up; except a couple of slightly large ovaries and a borderline enlarged spleen and the fatty liver I've had my whole life since I'm heavy. I have been able to eat a bit more over the past couple of days; but I get full very fast. I've lost 6 lbs really quickly. The night I went to the ER; I had a bowel movement and wiped away nothing but green mucus. The stool was very light tan and basically just looked like brown crisco. It was just fat. All of my bowel movements since have been the same; with copious amounts of green mucus. My whole mid-section is so bloated and sore and I feel short of breath. I am really at a loss for what could be wrong. As I mentioned; my mother has Crohn's disease and she said this sounds nothing like the problems she has. The ER doc mentioned gastroparesis since I have a diabetes; but it actually seems like I digest things FASTER than normal; if anything. I ate grapes a couple of weeks ago and eliminated them whole 4 hours later. This is a really scary feeling. I could deal with everything that happened before and just keep pushing forward; but even drinking liquid is a challenge on occasion. Does anyone have any idea what this sounds like? What my next move forward should be?,2011,2015,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was diagnosed 2 years ago with AIP; have a 25 year history of autoimmune disorders (eosinophilic vasculitis; mild Sjogren's). Usually have done well with prednisone for the various flare-ups but with AIP; still recurring symptoms and the elevated IgG4 periodically. Next step may be Imuran.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Has anyone used Colloidal Silver during Interferon treatment? I have heard of people not able to do the Interferon / Ribavirin had used Colloidal Silver as an alternitive. Well I have Hep C. Geno Type 1. And I have been making quality Colloidal Silver for many years. I know all the tricks and processes to produce the smallest partical size possible. Which is absorbed by the body much easier. Well I have been on Pegisis (Interferon) getting close to 6 months now. My first V-count was 790;000. One month of treatment it dropped to 190;000. And then to 4000; and then to 700; and now I am at 42 and looks as if I may clear this. A couple months I had 2 8oz glasses a day of 15ppm Colloidal Silver a day. I have on a minimum 3 glasses of Silver a week. My color is good; not Gray. I just wondered has anyone ventured off into Medical Sience and expiermented like this? I am not recommending anyone try this. I think it has helped me; I dont know. Properly made Colloidal Silver in your home is the best; you control the quality...,2010,2010,51,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm 1 month post treatment with SOC. What is so wrong about people with a high BMI being encouraged to try treatment? If it doesn't work by 4 or 12 weeks they can just stop the way any other treater can stop. Why can't we be encouraged too? The reason I'm putting this out there is because I don't feel that there is a whole lot of support for the individuals who have a high BMI and are thinking of treating. In fact I've seen them discouraged!,2008,2009,53,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Dear Doctors; I am a girl of 35 years; good health; normal weight etc. I would apreciate your opinion to my problems. November 2004 muscle twitching starts in calves. 1 month after a viral infection. Spreads over the next months to thighs; abdomen; genital area; and arms. July 2005 ; I wake up one morning with as strange vibrating; pins and needles feeling in my genital area. The feeling persists; comes and goes durign the day but is there every day. August 2005; the "vibrations" / pins and needles spread to legs; but are still worse en gentital area. August 2005; MRI of head and lumbar spine; plus neuro examination is normal.B12; Thyroid function; calcium levels etc is normal. September to december 2005; cold feelings in the legs comes and goes; cold feeling in scalp comes ang goes; a feeling of heavines in left side of face happens twice; lasts for a few minutes. Twitches under the feet starts. The worse thing is still the pins and needles feeling everyday in my groin; genetial area! I am exercising without problems. I am really confused; I am gettign scared and my thoughts about this is keeping me awake at night. My questions: Could this be MS? Could this be myastenia Gravis? Waht I fear the most is the paraneoplastic syndrome; what are your thoughts? Is this some kind of neuropathy? I am very interested in knowing if this could be a bening thing; We were planning to have kids; but I do not know what to do now. I don`t want kids if I have a malignant condition. Thank you so much!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,the profile has just changed and it's good for us; but requires understanding as it just got more complex. I will try to explain and then give you the study. We have long chains of encoding within our DNA. Each strand within that long chain has a combo of the basic proteins. When we speak of the alleles within a group; it is these pieces of data we referrence. the patient only need know that how these proteins are encoded within your cells determines how strongly your body may be able to fight this virus. Past threads have discusses the first test that became available as a genetic predictor. Now labcorp (through Arup) is making available 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rather than 1. what that means is that we will know the Interleukin program within 2 of our gene programs; and have a better predictor of outcome. Now here's where it gets tricky. the original test some members already got showed a 2-3 fold increase in SVr with the right genes. this test is known as the IL28b rs12979860 with this test the best combo to have is C/C; followed by C/T; and by TT being the worst. Now they have moved up the chain to test one more set of alleles; and this test is call the IL28b rs8099917. with this group T/T is the most favorable outcome; followed by G/T followed by GG being the worst. now you see where confusion could come in. TT is least favorable with the test for one grouping; and most favorable with the group next door!! here's the study: http://www.natap.org/2010/HCV/050310_09.htm now I just happened to have had this testing done and my results arrived today. to my surprise I was CC on the rs 12979860 and TT on the rs 8099917 it doesn't get any better than that. this means that I should be able to clear with a PI added especially if I keep my IR down and get my Dietary restrictions in place. It also means my diet had a great deal to do with why I didn't clear because I was extremely compliant on tx and my genes helped; so I should have cleared; except for being stage 3/4 which also may have lowered my chances.,2007,2011,59,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I don't even have to go into a long drawn out story about this. WE THYROIDANS WANT TO LOOSE WEIGHT .................RIGHT? I found a very basic and simple plan that can definately help us combat this nasty problem. Dr Barry Sears has two wonderful books out - one that I have is "A Week in the ZONE". Hypo's have two major problems. Controlling insulin in blood sugar and burning carbs. We no longer have the metabolic rate within our bodies to naturally burn these two evils. Hense we get fat and can develop diabetes. Here is a quick glance of a newsletter I get. When you eat a carbohydrate; your pancreas secretes insulin to drive down blood sugar back to a normal level. If you eat too many carbohydrates; your pancreas releases so much insulin that it can drive down blood sugar to a level too low to allow your brain to function effectively. This condition of low blood sugar and high insulin can be considered a step away from diabetes. According to the Zone theory; when you're creating this excess insulin; it also prevents your body from using its stored fat for energy. Hence; your insulin response to excess carbos causes you to gain weight; or you cannot lose weight. If you are looking for a step by step plan to assist your goals - google seach Dr Barry Sears and read the research he offers for hypothyroid patients. Since I am trying myself to conquer my 20 pounds of weight gain. I find it very helpful to have the book I am reading to keep referring back to. If anyone is interested and wants more info - PM me and I will try to answer your questions.,2008,2008,42,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm 53; 5'11"; 265 lbs. (lost about 20 lbs last year). As you can see below I have been through a lot; taking a lot of medicine. My main concern is my sex drive is gone. It has been declining for years. Especially since I started have so many surgeries since 2006. I've been reading sites for years and realized the problem. My GP has been telling me my T level was fine. Back before my Spine fusion in 2010; my surgeon told me that all my symptoms sounded like low T and suggested a Urol. He checked everything out and said it was very low. He started me on Test. (see below). After about the 2-3 injection I felt great; my wife felt betterïŠ. About 3 months later I had the fusion. I went back to the Urog and he said my level was at a good level and it was left up to me. The shots have continued to help my energy; but my sex drive has gone to nothing. I was able to get off my Celexa for about a week and that helped; but this time it's not helping. The depression has got worse. I've tried many times to get off the pain and other medicines; but that makes me worse. They allow me to get up and be able to function every day. I have a great pain Dr. I've noticed my testicles is much smaller and harder than they was. Something has to be done. I think God that my wife understanding with my problem. Money is very limited and I live in a small town; I have to travel about 2-3 hrs. To a true professional; if you know what I mean.. I'm under Medical Supervision! I see my GP every 3 months; and Urologist every 6 months; and my Pain Mang. Every month. I'm still searching for other's experience and advice. GP only suggested is I get off my depression med for a few days break; that use to work; but not no more. Any help is appreciated. One more thing while I'm asking. My nipples burns like they are on fire. They can do it for a minute or they will do it for hours; sometime days. I can go for days between or weeks and sometimes months. My GP says my shirts are irriatating them. That is BS; I've had it happening to long and know it can be with or without shirt; hot or cold. Nothing will stop it; I've used every type of numbing medicine; etc. It stops when it wants to. Had a health food lady tell me one time that I needed to take women vitamins; said my estrogen is high.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am new to this; but here it goes...I am 32 years old and I just had a pituitary tumor removed 3 weeks ago. I have been trying to find out how people felt after the surgery. I of course have headaches; and dizziness. But it actually feels like my head is clearer...before my surgery I couldnt seem to form a thought; I was so weak. I still have weakness but not as bad. My eyes used to hurt; and very hard to focus. I didnt have the best experience after the surgery; they didnt even give me discharge instructions. During my follow up with the O.R. nurse she finally told me that I cant sniff; blow my nose; try not to sneeze and dont hold my head down. She said for at least 2 to 3 months!! Is that for real???? I am on hydrocortisone 3 times a day; and before the surgery i was diagnosed with hypersomnia; because i couldnt seem to stay awake. I would wake up; and about 1 to 2 hours later I will fall asleep. I had to stop driving because i would fall asleep. I am more alert now; but how long will it take to start feeling normal again??? Will I ever feel normal again???,2009,2009,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I had a heart attack (MI) in 1992 followed by a PE and pulse that went up 185 and diagnosed type 2 diabetic requiring insulin injections. Two years ago I changed my lifestyle and eating habits and with weight loss and exercise managed to come off insulin injections and 20 months later my HbA1c (without any medication ) is running at 6%. With this change which was achieved by not following standard dietary information encourages me to believe that further improvement can be gained blood pressure has dropped from 185/90 to 104/75 (with reduced medication). I had an angiogram in 2005 during which it was recommended to either have stents or a bypass which I declined to see if my new regime could generate improvement ; which happened and have been told that surgery is not required at this stage. My diet has moved to organic plant based and would like to know if a simple non invasive test can be performed to assess changes with in my arteries either getting better or worse? Currently my cholesterol = 140 with Hdl =60 both of which I am trying to improve.,2007,2007,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For a few days now I have been experiencing itching on my plams of hands and feet but it's not a consent thing. I thought maybe it could have been an allergic reaction to tomatoes or some other food. I have been taking some natural detox for the blood in pills form; I was feeling ok but last nite and this morning my hands started up again but not terrible that i want to rip them off; it's more of a burning irritating itch that is under the skin; no rash no dry skin and it tends to be activated when I do things like opening a soda bottle top or holding the retractable lead for the dogs...I guess if there is a certain kind of pressure and rubing againist the hands they start to bother me and usually cold water or ice; anything cold makes it feel better. I had experienced a migraine a few days ago but I get those normally so I dont know if that has something to do with it. Any ideas on what would cause this kind of itching on the palms of the hands and feet under the skin?? I really hope it's not something were I need to go see a doctor; no insurance and no job = no money :(,2006,2006,,

I need answers and help PLEASE I am requiring any help feedback; as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms; 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others in Doncaster; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company;I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully more than 23yrs and a director of my own businesses; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old.Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago; whilst out with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. My 24year old daughter said; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; ‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’ I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. early stages of diabetic retinopathy I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. However from the moment I had this mild stroke I have been getting recurring stroke like type symptoms; for now 3years after from 3 to 7days a week during my sleep and frequently during the day. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months;its virtually stopped. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a heavy attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; dizziness; pain in my head; pain in my left eye socket; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so. Once i have recovered ie woken up after a sleep from 2 to 4hrs; i feels sometimes like I am drunk and very hung-over for a day or two; I am completely washed out; with varying pains; headaches and i am unable to walk once these attacks happen and i am very weak on my left side leg and arm daily and on-going. I get dizzy spells during an attack and also when im not having an attack. Also I am slurring; or mumbling during an attack; my speech is clear when I am not suffering attacks however my wife and children have stated that sometimes i say the wrong words or whilst speaking sometimes put the wrong words that im trying to say; in the wrong part of a sentence; which they find amusing; and i find frustrating and angry with myself for doing that; but i do not have slurred speech outside an attack unless I am tired.. My vision has deteriorated since the stroke; and my left eyesight is terrible; i have just been diagnosed with glaucoma and diabetes and early stages of diabetic retinopathy; however the medics are looking into my eyesight issues but with no joy. As a previous troubleshooter in management and business; in working as a consultant in performance and productive environments and with working knowledge of performance measures within the national health service; i feel I am a problem to performance and productivity figures as i am still on the consultants caseload. However these are just my feelings. My local GP; is understanding and very GOOD at helping me emotionally and with medication to control my symptoms. I have never ever regained the full strength in my left leg or arm; this was only a small stroke; due to clotting from furred up carotid artery the consultants have informed me. I am constantly in turmoil over this; feeling very depressed and even suicidal on a daily basis; My stroke was not a bleed; it was a mild stroke; possibly caused by a clot from the diagnosed furred up carotid artery in my neck. My uncles; grandparents on both sides have died from strokes and heart attacks I just need some answers or other experiences and how they have coped or resolved. I need help and answers and im praying for answers; please help someone; all this makes me feel very suicidal. Doing this email is very hard mentally as i am constantly drained; it has taken me 3 weeks on and off to try and compile this email with the help of my wife and others.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi everyone I will be starting Clomid next month and wanted to know how many of you ladies have been on and how many have you got pregnant on the first cycle. Alittle bit nervous about the whole thing but I know it will be alright. I really cant wait to get started on the whole thing. So any feedback and thoughts about Clomid would be appreciated. Thanks a bunches... Anna,2007,2007,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone I think that this form will be very helpful for all that are on Clomid or that will start Clomid soon. Let me start by saying that I have PCOS and I have 11 year old daughter I have been TTC on and off the last 7 years but since I been married a year ago we been trying faithfully. I was on Clomid in Nov. 2009 I was taking 50mg 3-7cd I was told that I didnt O on this round and that I would need to go up on my next round. Dec came and went no AF so went in to see if I was Pergo but no I was not so they put me on provrea then Clomid on 3-7 100mg. I am now on my 3 and last round of Clomid I am on 150mg 3-7 days and I hope that this time I O because on my last round they told me I O early on cd 15 I have never O in 11 years so that was a good thing. But doc said that the numbers where not where he wanted them to be at so that is why he up my clomid this time. As for side effects on 50mg I had mood swings and hot flashes and the wonderful headaches... On 100mg I thank god I did not have any but did have crazy dreams with them. And with 150mg I had the vision problems. I just hope that this time works. Would love to hear your stories on Clomid and hear how long before you got your BFP on Clomid...,2010,2010,30,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I have been undergoing cortisol testing for a couple months. My UFC has always been elevated (since I started testing for it a few years ago). For several years I have had Hashimoto's; Sjogren's; FM; asthma since birth; anxiety & depression for over 30 years; IBS and the list goes on and on. Finally after complaining enough to my Endo; and proving to him that I have gained weight (mainly stomach and back) for no reason and cannot lose it no matter what I do (I had to provide him with RMR test results; which state I have a fast metabolism; food and exercise journals; etc) he started to look into it for me. The UFC is always around 100. He has not given me the results of the last one I did in June even though I have asked more than 5 times. After the UFC test; I did a dex supp test. I took the dex pill at 11 pm and blood draw at 8 am the following morning. The serum cortisol suppressed from 41 down to 4.1. My endo said that was good but not good enough; that it needed to supp below 2. It's been 3 weeks since those tests. Tonight I am doing the salivary cortisol test; and tomorrow night another 1 mg dex supp test. He wants to check the actual dex level to see if there's something that is causing the supp not to fully work. I have Kaiser HMO and they don't normally do the salivette tests. They special ordered the salivette kit for me and I just picked it up. There's no instructions. It's being done through QUEST and theres conflicting information on test prep. Some directions say to rinse your mouth out with clean water and wait 10 minutes before doing the test at midnight. Others do not tell you to rinse. Does anyone know what I am supposed to do? Nobody at Kaiser is familiar with the test. Also; can my thyroid problems have anything to do with cortisol problems? This is what the endo emailed me about my thyroid tests: "As far as the reverse T3 is concerned; it is high; again this is found in "stressed" states; it is part of a "sick euthyroid" process with is a stressed state causing the shift. Chronic "sick euthyroid" conditions are not well described like acute sick euthyroid. We are still waiting for the free T3 level to come back.". We initially found the high RT3 over a year ago so I added cytomel in May 2010. I take it 2x a day and cant even feel it like most people say they do. I could easily take it and fall right asleep. Could all of this (cortisol/thyroid/autoimmune) be related? I take the following meds: levothroid 100 mcg 1x day; cytomel 5 mcg 2x day; wellbutrin 150 sr 2x day; famotidine 40 mg 2x day; yasmin; hydroxyzine; green tea; vitamins; some days I take motrin 800. I ocassionally use an albuterol inhaler and about 1x a year; when I have a bad asthma flare; I have to do a 4 day round of prednisone; not enough to cause elevated cortisol. Any help would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post. Thank you.,2008,2011,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I started with 1 nodule accidently found in 2008 and now have 4 nodules and my PCP said I now have " non toxic multinodular goiter". I have an apt with the endocrinologist on Tuesday and would like someone with the same experience to give me suggestions on what to ask. I already was told to ask for the antibody tests to check for Hashimotos disease. My PCP wants me to have a biopsy because the nodules have become more solid. I had a FNA biopsy in 2010.,2015,2015,58,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone; First thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm just trying to understand what is happening with my MIL. She is a 68 yr old female with CHF; Diabetes; Chronic back pain from nerve damage; and now esld we think from the years of pain meds. She was complaining of symptoms for 1.5 years I know and her primary care doctor did not find the liver disease. Now we are told because of her other health issues and the advanced stage of her ld there is nothing that can be done. She has ascites; edema; stomach pain. She was sent home on hospice for CHF with palliative care only. She is not being treated with lactulose because they said it was not helping. Now she has been told they will not do anymore drains because the fluid will come back quicker. I don't understand why these things are being with held from her since they are comfort measures. Thanks for reading this my MIL is very special to me. She is the only grandparent my kids have left and they are still very young. Maybe I am just having trouble accepting that the end us near. Thanks Denise,2015,2015,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi i had comprehensive private blood tests about 2 weeks ago; i took them to my doctor and he retested me for all of them to check; i think they suggest hyperthyroid; possible malabsorption; possible auto immune; any thoughts/ Vit D = 26 ( second test 24 ); Normal range = 75 to 200 Vit Folate = 3.8 (second test 3.4); private normal range 4.6 - 18.7 ( NHS normal range 3 - 20) Vit B12 = 285; ( second test 241) private Norm range = 191- 946 ( NHS norm range 140-600) Creatinine level of 114 ( second test 101); abnormal is above 110 Whit blood cell = 4.3; ( second test 4.7) Norm range 4 - 11 RBC = 11.9 ; NHS Normal range 11.6 -14.6 Fasting glucose 5; Norm is above 6.2 TSH = 2 ; ( second test 0.8) NHS normal range 0.35 - 5 Free t4 = 25.2 ; Norm range 12-22 I wasnt tested for free t4 the second time; i was tested for Total t4 instead which was 19.9 ; norm range 10-19 Im losing weight; my food goes straight through me; i have all the hyper symptoms except bulging eyes and goiter. I believe i have suffered with a vit D problem for years; as i have bad knees; i have never been to the doctors about them until recently; but i believe the vit D has given me arthritis in my knees; im seeing a specialist in a month about my knees. But i also believe if you have a Vit D problem for a while it can cause you to develop a thyroid problem? malabsorption problem? or auto immune prob? My family has a long list of auto immune probs Anyway ; my doctor is starting me on Vit D tablets today for 2 months and then i go on a lower dose for 1 month. He said i shouldnt worry about the low vit B12 or folate; even though i believe the folate is very low and as i was misdiagnosed with a nurological disorder for 10 years and im still having problems with my speech i thought my b12 could do with being a lot higher. He said to take the vit D for 3 months and then come back to retest to see what my Vit D; b12; and folate levels were; He also said the thyroid can be affected by stress and as my body was low in vit D it would be good to retest thyroid again in 3 months after the Vit D kicks in. I dont know if im just been given the brush off; im happy to just take vit D for 3 months and then go back for tests; but what i wanted to know was should i be taking b12 or folate as well; or be asking to see an endo? thyroid probs do run in the family; but its hypo not hyper Thanks for any help,2014,2014,34,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I posted the bulk of this in the auto-immune & kidney forums; but I just want to get a "whadda you think" from people who have been through all the testing; diagnosis; MISdiagnosis; etc. I will post my current issue; then follow up below it with further background to explain why I feel this might be an appropriate forum for this. I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08; Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight; when there is no logical reason for it. Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone); PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal; just started Metformin therapy). On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June; my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a "normal" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website; but no mention was made to me; at my followup appt. On 01-06-10; I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit; my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again; no mention was made of this; although; in his defense; my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels; at this visit; which were very much out of range. I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here; as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59; for a woman; is suggestive of possible kidney damage; and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop; as they have in my case. I am obese (240 lbs); so I know that can affect the numbers; but I also have been plagued; over the yrs; with various auto-immune issues (ITP; Hashimoto's); and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes; that adds yet another concern. I do have some light edema in both legs; at the end of the day & severe pitting edema in my left leg; due to a severe injury in 2004; for which I wear a compression stocking. I know lymphatic system issues are another sign of kidney issues. ****Okay; now let me explain why I am thoroughly confused & troubled by all this (aside from obvious). As mentioned above; I have a history of KNOWN auto-immune problems. I also know that many of these disorders can overlap & you can very easily have more than one. What I can't understand is why the doctors are not discussing my eGFR & creatinine levels with me; given my past/current auto-immune problems & my current pre-diabetic state. My kidney function should be a glaring red flag to them; right now..esp. with the edema. What I did not mention above; but may have mentioned in old; old posts in other forums; is that I did have one ANA test done; a few yrs ago; after I saw my PCP for a VERY bizarre (for me) reaction to the sun. I am as lily white as they come & don't get deliberate exposure to the sun very often at all. That summer; I got a wild hair to add some color. On the very 1st attempt to sunbathe in my back yard; I had only been lying on the lawn chair for about 5 min. when my whole body started itching like ants were attacking me all over. I jumped up; thinking I had lain in an ant bed. Nothing. I tried to lay back down; but the itching was unbearable. I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to the sunscreen or the plastic on the chair; so I went in & took a shower. Within 30 min; I was covered head to toe in a "chigger-like" rash. My husband looked at it & said "You have chiggers!" We live in an area not known for chigger infestations; but I mentioned this to my PCP; & he agreed it was not likely chiggers. Because of the past auto-immune stuff; he ran the ANA; but it came back negative; so he diagnosed "contact dermatitis; unknown cause". I am now wondering; with everything else; if I didn't have a Lupus flare; despite the negative ANA. I've been too scared to tempt fate with the sun again. Also; since then; I have recurrent urticarial flares (hives); which sometimes cause my eyes & throat to swell shut (anaphylaxis). My PCP could not find a cause for that either; so he just wrote me an RX for an Epi Pen. Even if it isn't Lupus; I am very; very concerned & worried abt what might be happening to my kidneys. My understanding is that you can slow the drop of your eGFR & slow or stop the progression of kidney disease; but you can never regain those numbers or that function back. Kidney disease is nothing I want to mess around with. Any thoughts? Thanks; Angela,2007,2010,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Anyone functioning well enough to answer; to discuss your coping with stroke deficits that have remained for a year ago or longer. My stroke was more than 3.5 years ago and I still have some resentment about everything that I can't do. I would like to get a better attitude about it. But either way you are handling it; it would be helpful for me to hear about anyone else who still struggles with problems. I feel that hearing from someone who is in the same position as I am; would be the best therapy for me. Thanks in advance to anyone who answers this. Sara,2011,2012,,Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This is my final resort. In the past few weeks I've been to the E.R. twice; my regular phsycian numerous times; a neurologist; an endocronologist and an infectious disease doctor. I've had numerous MRI's; blood tests; etc. and everything has come back negative. (other than a test that says my B12 level is kind of low) Currently I'm been experienceing: *Constant "brain-fog" - feeling completely out of it or as though i'm on drugs or alcohol - unreal feeling *persistent stomach pains and gas *headaches *weakness *unexplained anxiety/panic attack/depressive sympt. *numbness *loss of appetite *irritability *chills/hot flashes *spots in front of my eyes Last night I had extreme stomach pains and diarreha - which was a first for me since this began. Afterwards; all of the symptoms seemed to subside. I did not eat for the rest of the night or the mroning. However; once I ate lunch the brain-fog and other symptoms reoccured. I'm now thinking this could be a GI issue. Can anyone help me?!,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I used depo provera injections for two and a half years. It's been over a year since my last injection. within the first six months after stopping the shot I gained 40lbs without a change in my diet and excercise.I was told this was unusual to gain after stopping the shot and that i may never lose the weight. Is this true? or is the only way to go back on the shot because while i was on the shot i actually lost weight.but if that's the answer won't i be trapped on the shot forever?,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 21 year old woman struggling with steadily declining health. I have struggled with chronic stomach pain and constipation; restless leg syndrome; vulvodynia and asthma since early childhood. Rosacea; severe depression and anxiety; fatigue; brain fog (derealization/depersonalization); hypothyroidism; facial pain; and sporadic but managable muscle pain since early /mid teens. I have bruised at the drop of a hat and struggled with being overweight since I was young; and have chronic lower right quadrant pain in my abdomen that flares up strongly when I do most forms of cardio (or sometimes for no reason; I had a paranoia about appendicitis for years from it). Gluten seemed to make things worse; so I stopped eating the obvious sources (bread; pasta; etc) two years ago but I was lacking in information and didn't know about cross contamination so I was undoubtedly still ingesting some. I was having difficulty eating as a wide group of foods started bothering me in a variety of ways- from stomach pain to fatigue to worsened rosacea or asthma. I suspected celiac or other food intolerances but my IGA test actually came back mildly deficient. I saw a gastro that told me to do a gluten challenge so she could do an endoscopy; which I did for 8 weeks. It was the worst 2 months of my life. I spent the first two days being violently ill; with a reaction that resembled food poisoning but no one else in my family was affected. I developed severe fatigue and sciatic pain that made it hard to walk. I could not eat anything without having to lay down for an hour afterwards because it made me so sick to my stomach. I had so much gas in my stomach one sip of water would cause me to burp again and again for 30 minutes; and meals were much worse. My anxiety and depression; which had been pretty well managed for about two years; came back so strongly I had panic attacks while I was trying to sleep. I had such severe brain fog I lost the ability differentiate between dreams and reality and believed I was a ghost. I felt detached from my body; and I felt like someone else was controlling me. I developed pain all over my body and muscle weakness that made me exhausted after one trip up the stairs. My restless leg syndrome; which had been in remission for four years; came back affecting my entire body including my genitals in a way I believe is similar to restless genital syndrome. I was completely and utterly miserable and I spent 80% of the time in my bed wishing for death. They did the endoscopy and colonoscopy and I immediately cut gluten out of my diet and started attempting to avoid CC. My results came back negative on everything except for gastritis; which I believe was actually caused by the gluten. Unfortunately for me; while some of the symptoms did decrease and I no longer feel like a ghost; I didn't get better enough. The muscle pain was diagnosed as fibromyalgia; the restlessness in my entire body is still present; my anxiety and depression have set me back pretty far; the brain fog is still bad enough that I can't drive; my stomach is still inflamed to the point that I can't eat grains or processed food and am living off bananas and chicken. It's been three months since my procedure. Before the trial; I was lifting weights and going biking and gardening and attempting to feel like a normal human being but now my body is still in utter chaos. I used my elliptical machine for 10 minutes yesterday; slowly; on the lowest setting; and today I am in utter agony. And no one will believe me that I have food issues. I essentially got a pat on the head from my gastro; and now the rheumatologist I went to for my fibro diagnosis wants to put me on Plaquenil because although my Lupus tests came back negative she wants to see if it will change anything; but I'm terrified to try something that heavy. I just don't know what to do! I can't even go to the store longer than 30 minutes because it gives me such bad back pain to walk for that long; and I can't work or go to school and I have no friends or hobbies that I can do. I'm so sad all the time; at this point I just want to die. I'm only 21! What can I do?? Does this sound like any disease you've heard of? Everyone keeps telling me it can't be celiac because "your scopes were normal;" but so far no one has come up with a better idea. I don't know what I'll do if these symptoms never go away. Please help me.,2010,2013,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am a 26 y-o- Female. For the past 3 months now I have been having strange symptoms like nausea; dizziness (extreme at times); headache behind the eye and sensitivity to light; joint/muscle aches and stiffness mostly in hands and feet but occassionally like a full body flu-type attack; weakness in wrists; cold feet and hands that feel like they are plunged in ice water whenever I take a hot bath/shower; constant feeling of cold so that I just can't get warm; occasional hot flashes and chills; exhaustion and sleepiness all day but hard to stay asleep; and memory problems/disorientation like a brain "fog"; flashes and shadows out of the corner of my eyes; and some other symptoms not listed. I have a history of Graves Disease diagnosed at 12 years old and treated for several years with PTU. I had a relapse at the age of 18 and had radioactive ablation of the thyroid done. I have recently seen a rhuematologist due to a slightly elevated RH factor (14) and he drew more labs to detect Lupus and other autoimmune connective tissue disorders; all of which came out negative or normal including the CCP test for rheumatoid arthritis. Though my TSH levels have been hard to keep stable (recently miscarried at 8 weeks with a TSH of 40); this last test was normal (Currently taking thyroxin 100 mcgs and Cytomel 10 mcgs) including antibody and FT4 and FT3 levels. Blood count and lIver tests were also normal. Xrays of hands and chest were normal. Opthamologist visit reported normal eyes except for slight dryness. Other than these; I have a history of repeated low vit D levels; atypical PCOS as determined by cystic ovaries on ultrasound and borderline insulin resistence; but no androgenic factors. I go to neurology in a month's time and also back to rheumatology. I know there are autoimmune disorders of the nervous system that can cause some of these symptoms; but I have not noticed numbness or nerve-like pains or extreme muscle weakness that seem to be found in most of them. I know it is possible that I have the early stages of rhuematoid arthritis as I do have a family history of it; but some of these symptoms don't seem to fit. Any ideas about what could be going on with me and further testing I need to pursue? Thank you.,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I found the above topic last night at this same forum; though its dated 6 yrs back and I couldnt find anything more recent as I was searching for an answer to my own problem of the foulest burps that ever existed; then comes the diarhea and finally the vomitting. For me this can last up to two or three days. I was so relieved to find that other people have and are experiencing these same symptoms. Though im worried that no one has found and answer; maybe they have; as I said; the only forum I found for this is on this web site and its 6 yrs old. Im hoping someone has some new answer to this same problem. Its dibilitating when it happens; hard to go to work while im busy crapping and puking myself to half to death. Again; the burps are the absolute worst; those alone taste so bad its enough to make me sick and the sulphuric smell is just awful. Really its like im farting out my mouth. Hopefully after 6 yrs someone has some kind of real answer to this problem. Thk you.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello everyone; 25/M About a year ago I began experiencing some strange sensations which I sometimes have trouble finding the words to describe; but their presence is definitely there regardless. In a nutshell my symptoms seem to be fatigue; lightheadedness; "brain fog"; trouble focusing; numbness and generally just feeling disconnected. I'm "not there" so to speak; both physically and mentally. I can still function in my daily life; but doing anything that requires real thought (including conversation) is very hard sometimes and it's sort of like my mind and body have been numbed and covered in novocain. I feel stoned and like things just aren't really hitting me so to speak. There are times when it's hard to even focus my eye sight on anything; as all my eyes want to do is drift off and blankly stare in to the middle distance while my head shuts. I'm like a zombie and talking to people is like struggling through improv. It doesn't feel natural and life is sort of like reading the words out of a book and understanding what they mean; but not quite having them quite connect. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy; or that I'm not even a real person...but again; it's hard to describe. I also have fatigue; which hits me very hard toward the end of the day (along with dizzy spells) and all I want to do is crash in my bed when I get home from work. I've also suddenly developed large bags/circles under my eyes over the last year; but I'm not sure how that could be related. I've had every type of bloodwork done which all came back normal as did my EEG. This has brought me to the conclusion that it has to be something "mental" as opposed to physical; but whether that's anxiety; ADD; depression; depersonalization; post traumatic stress disorder or something else is hard to say. I tried taking Lexapro for a short while which may have helped a bit; but I stopped about a month in since it completely killed my libido and that wasn't even remotely acceptable to me. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? Is this all in my head or are there physical disorders that can result in these feelings? My only other lead is that I started feeling this way shortly after I moved in to my new apartment; so it's possible there's some sort of mold that's making me have problems. I also feel somewhat better when I visit my parents out of state for a week; but that could very well just be in my head or a result of lessened anxiety...Who knows. I just need help and I honestly don't know what else to ask.,2009,2009,25,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For the past 2 days I have a very slight heat sensation in my lower left leg (no other problems). Is this some thing I should be concerned about now; or wait for my drs. appt in a few weeks?,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have a severe problem with profuse sweating...I have had it for as long as I can remember...I can't keep my hair dry..my face is wet and dripping with sweat it's very embarrasing and disabeling. I can walk from my front door to the car and my face is sweating like I had ran a marathon...I can't go on like this I need suggestions please. I am 56 weight about 230 and in good health otherwise. I take asthma medication singular and abluteral inhaler as needed. Is there a medication I can take or a surgery? I can't stand this any longer it's living hell. I don't mean to sound so desperate but it's horrible to live like this I cry about it and stay so miserable. It can be below zero outside and I sweat...If I just sweep the floor I get so hot I have to take a break to cool down...the smallest amount of exercise makes me sweat badly. Sweat pours from my face; my back my clothes stick to me and my makeup runs off. ;my hair is wet...my face gets blood red and I'm just miserable daily. Is there an answer I would really appreciate some help. Thank you,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Here is just one of the many dangers of ALA IV therapy: This is from Pubmed which is considered to be very trustworthy by the medical community. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19616616 "We conclude that large doses of lipoic acid displace sulfhydryls from binding sites; resulting in depletion of serum cysteine; but also pose a methylation burden with severe depletion of liver S-adenosylmethionine and massive release of S-adenosylhomocysteine. These changes may have previously unrecognized deleterious (harmful) effects that should be investigated in both human disease and experimental models",2006,2010,52,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm new to this and just hoping to get some good answers from some of ya'll with thyroid disease. I had my first and only child in Dec '05. Developed hyperthyroidism April '06 and have been ever since even to this day. I have gone to several Endo's and got answers like Grave's Disease; Hashimoto's; thyroid going to fail; etc. Not one of the same diagnosis from any Endo. I have a new Endo appt. next Thursday at U. of Penn and I got some great references so I hope he is the one. My levels have gone down considerably. Here are some of my results: Thyroglobulin Antibodies 93 High (<20) Thyroid Peroxidase >1000 high (<35) T3; Total 473 high (60-181) T4; Free 3.3 high (0.8-1.8) TSH 0.01 low The TSH has been bouncing between 0.01 and 0.02 low. The t4; Free had been at 10.6 but has come down a bit. The T3 is slowly but surely increasing a bit every time I get a new blood test. The Endo that thought I have Hashimoto's said it was becasue of the antibodies. The other Endo said that I was going to crash and be low; Hashimoto's. Another one said that I had Grave's and the last one said it was Post-partum thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism only and that in time I would recover. As all of this is going on; I have gained 20 lbs. and I'm very sad; I just can't get it off and I'm only eating about 200-300 calories a day now. This is something that is confusing doctors too. Along with the thyriod; I suddenly developed PCOS. My gyno thinks it's from the thyroid levels being high and the Reproductive Endo tells me its not. Now I'm one birth control which makes me nauseous all day long. I've tried almost all brands on the market and I still get nauseous all day long. I live outside of Philadelphia and we are lacking in good Endo's in this area so I keep searching for the right one that seems to know what is going on. This has turned into a nightmare; I'm supposed to be enjoying my life as a new mommy and I'm so sad all of the time; I keep getting fatter and fatter!! Maybe someone else has a similar problem; heard of it before; knows someone with the same problem or can give me any advice as to what is going on with me. I will be so absolutely grateful to you.,2007,2007,30,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,H-E-L-P!!! I've had this uncontrollable itch on my outer labia's for the past 7 years. Everyday I itch; I feel like a freak because I am always scratching (not in public). My labia gets sore from the scratching and I break skin often from scratching. I have tried everthing; but it doesn't go away. I know it's not an STD because I went to the doctor's and have been tested. However they haven't helped me none. The labia skin is thickened from the scratching; is very dry (white-like) and flaky (at times). So are my inner thighs at the crease yet they do not itch that often. There are no bumps but my skin is raised; and I don't know what it is. I thought about Lichen; but I do not see my vagina changing in that form; like the pictures that I have researched. Please Please help me figure out what other problems there might be. I have been in the same relationship all this time. Also; if you know any remedies for the itching; please send my way. I use All Free & Clear laundry detergent; and wash with warm water as I fell needed throughout the day. I also don't get my period often; I tied my tubes in 2003; so I don't take any BC. I am not on any medication. Just looking for what else might there be... Thanks; Itchy_Itchy,2006,2006,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm 25 and I have always had irregular periods; but now I have had one that has lasted about 6-7 weeks and counting. It's sometimes heavy and then most of the time it's light. Sometimes it's like 'period' blood and other times it fresh - like i've just cut myself. I've been to see the nurse and she did a few blood tests and the results are i have to go back for a prolactin test in 3 months. She also did a pregnancy test - but I can't be pregnant. I'm about 3 stone over weight and the nurse said that wasn't the problem. I am not taking any medication and i'm not on any birth control (my fiance had a vasectomy in 1989). I have recently changed my diet for the better - eating fresh; homemade food instead of processed. I also haven't had any major stress in my life recently. When it first started i was tired a lot - but not after 6 odd weeks; i don't seem to have any side effects. Can someone help please.,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi. FOr ages I have been complaining about dizziness and a pins and needles feeling in my left cheek. (by ages; since 2003) I have been sent for ultrasound of coratid artery (no problems) and and MRI/MRA (no problems) but the symptoms are not only stil there; they are getting worse; considerably. I have noticed that this summer; with humidity real high; they are horrible! When this happens; I will feel a pins and needles type tingling from actually right below my jaw bone; covering the entire left side of my face to the left of my eye and about a 1/3 of the way into my forehead on same side. This will intensify as the day goes on. Then my neck will hurt BAD! Again; always the left; from my shoulder blade; sort of up the back of my neck; to behind my left ear. After that I will be hit with HUGH waves of dizziness; sometimes to the point of almost blacking out. I have a real feeling something is major wrong! I feel somewhat sick to my stomach. When I say dizziness; it isn't like everything spins; it is like I feel out of whack. This really has me worried. It comes out of no place; my stress level is probably the lowest it has been in years ( I quit work a few months ago and am glad about that decision - no $$ issues because of it) Does ANYONE have a clue? My dr. just told me medicine can't fix everything; but THIS IS NOT NORMAL and NOT in my head. I just don't want to have to have a stroke to prove it!,2006,2006,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I love running; using aerobic equipment and lifting weights; however; I ususually experience flu-like symtoms for days; sometimes weeks; later.

Any suggestions?,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches. My own doctor has; thus-far; not taken it very seriously and tends to take the line that; after years of 'getting away with it; maybe you've finally developed an allergy!',2007,2008,61,Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'll be 46 at the end of this month & just moved to a new state so I don't have the luxury of knowing any doctors. In the last 1-2 months I suddenly gained 40 + lbs & look pregnant. That seems to be where the weight all is. A urinalysis proved negative for pregnancy on Monday & with my 3 grown kids I did not gain this much weight &/or so fast. I just look pregnant & feel "full - heavy - tired & short of breath" most of the time. Tomorrow I go for a Pelvic ultrasound w/a full bladder. The day after I am scheduled for an Abdomen ultrasound - w/fasting. Any idea what we are looking for or what could cause this? I can barely eat because I feel so full & yet it's lately that I've gained the most weight. I am not in pain; I just feel miserable - like over due. When I asked at the doctor's office what could cause this & what we are looking for they said 'a cyst; tumor; or cancer'...... I would kind of like a bit more information if at all possible. In the last week I gained another 10lbs & I know this can not be good or keep on. Thanks; JoeShell,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am 27 years old and husband and I have been trying to conceive for 1 year. Dr. just diagnosed infertility and ordered a semen analysis (the 1st step for us) but we haven't done it yet. Now; my period is 5 days late (I calculate like a crazy woman). I am NEVER late and was sure THIS WAS IT. Lo and behold the test had a big minus. I cried. I didn't test in the a.m. but it says you don't have to.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have muscle spasm in or around the ribs on both sides (in the front under the breast and sometimes in the back at the same horizontal position); it feels like a ball rolling; in that it switches sides. It occurs even at night during sleep; painful enough to wake me. I only know that when I relax and stretch (the side where the knot is) using several positions I have to wait till it goes away; in many cases to have it return in other places described above. What does it mean; how do I treat it. I have high blood pressure and the meds deplete my potassium so I take a prescription supplement for that. What should I be asking my doctor.,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have recently been diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder called IgG4 Sclerosing Disease. I know very little about it and have had multiple surgeries and have seen MANY doctors regarding it. So far none of my doctors have seen anything like it and the only reason I reached this diagnosis was because one of my doctors reached out to a colleague at the MayoClinic in Rochester; MN who has 8 patients with this disease.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,This discussion is related to Sulphuric/ Eggy burps and stomach cramps. hello. Ocationally I have rotten egg burps. Especially a lot in the past couple of days!... at first I thought I might have a gluten allergy; but i can eat products with gluten in them; like bread; but ramen (oodles of noodles) and regular pasta I have problems with. Then I thought it was meat but a garlicy hamburger (which was my testing meat product) resulted in my feeling better. So I started to think maybe garlic or onions were the factor that would prevent my tummy from rebelling and so far that has worked. The symptoms are basically evil burps and tummy pain; no diahrehha ever has come with it yet. There were some articles that said it might be because of water that has been contaminated; where other sites support my gluten allergy theory. I have no idea what the problem might be; but I have saw that there were thousands of people who had very similar problems and after a complete GI series nothing; CT scans nothing; numerous blood tests and nothing! this seems to be a mystery problem. I myself have had elevated liver functions in a blood tests but everythign else I've been tested for has come back normal. any thoughts?,2008,2008,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 43 year old male with a long history of stomach issues. I take prilosec daily and have no idea what a "normal" bowel movement resembles. Sour stomach; cramps; reflux and soft stools are just a part of life for me and I've been able to lead a fairly normal and mobile life in spite of these issues. Six weeks ago; I went to work and took one of my kids w/me. He loves going to the office for some reason and he had nothing better to do on this particular summer day. Around 10am I started noticing that I was burping quite a bit and my son pointed out that something smelled like "rotten eggs". I agreed that something did smell putrid and that it was in fact my burps. As the day continued; the burps became more and more frequent with individual burps lasting longer and smelling even worse (if that's possible). Around 3pm; I told my boss I wasn't feeling well and excused myself. I drove to the hospital and the ER was empty. Not a person in sight! Wow! I told the nurse that I was in extreme abdominal discomfort; nauseous and pain radiating toward my back from my stomach region. Well; somehow that triggered the "high risk heart alert" which got me checked in in record time; and EKG; blood work; and who knows what else. Eventually they ruled out my heart and I continued to feel incredibly nauseous despite the three doses of anti-nausea medicine they had put in my IV. Once it was brought under control; they did CAT scans; x-rays and sonograms of my abdominal region. They checked everything! They found nothing. My appendix; galbladder; intestines and stomach appeared normal. They gave me two bags of iv antibiotics and lots of fluids via the iv. I just figured it was viral. The next day I checked out and went home having missed a day of work. Three weeks later; I started tasting the rotten egg burps again and about 3 hours later; I was heaving up my guts. I'm one of those people who really; really hates to vomit. I mean; I just wont do it unless there is just no option. I will feel sick longer rather than throw-up. I'd take a beating before willfully throwing up. Anyway; it was an unstoppable force and it just kept coming. My wife took me back to the hospital ER where they again performed many of the same tests which all came up negative. They gave me anti-nausea medicine which worked a bit better this time. Again; after 24 hours; the pain and nausea were gone. Today; September 7; 2003 I'm starting to taste the rotten egg burps. I can't afford to miss work tomorrow but more than that; I cannot afford to spend the night and tomorrow morning going through this hellish experience again. It's just too much. So; here's what I've tried. I took 40mg pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) delayed release tablet and an alka-seltzer. These were 2 of 3 ideas I found on this site. The 3rd idea said to eat a lime or lemon. I have to say; the burps do feel a bit controlled but I'm not ready to claim victory yet. I'll post tomorrow morning and let all know if this worked. God help me if it doesn't because for sure the medical community at large is not able to. All of these posts going back ten years and not a single person has said they have been cured yet? Please; if you have had this problem and have been correctly diagnosed and cured; post a response and let me know. Or; perhaps you have had this issue and know of a means of dulling the symptoms? That would be great too. I just can't believe that after over 40 years of never having anything like this happen; now It has happened 3 times in six weeks. Again; I'll post if my rotten egg burps have not turned into nausea by morning. -Condor301 This discussion is related to Sulphuric/ Eggy burps and stomach cramps.,2008,2008,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I see these comments are from 2006. I am currently having many of these same problems. Tickle in throat; sharp pain; cough; tears; nose dripping. This has been happening for the past 5 months. I've been to a ENT. He said it was my tonsils. I had them out. At first while I was on meds during my recovery from the surgery the symptoms stopped. But after I stopped taking the pain killers anti-biotic and the steroids the tickle came back. I've been taking Previcid for acid reflux but this has not stopped the attacks.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Please I would like some advise on how to control my weight. I have Hashimoto Disease a thyroid disorder. I seemed to grow regularly taking it off is something else. At 54 it isn't getting easier ..*smile*.. Four days a week my husband and I do the basic Pilate stretching exercise for 40 minutes. We also just started walking around the reservoir 4 times a week about a 2 to 2.5 walk. When not able to walk around the reservoir I walk on my walker for 20 minutes a good pace. Food wise; we really eat healthy. Morning we have oatmeal with raisin and cinnamon with milk we do not add sugar or honey. We share a apple and a bannana and we have a tad of cottage cheese on a half tomatoe. Lunch we usually have a sandwich mostly peanut butter n jelly sometimes tuna etc. At night we mostly have a nice fresh salad and our meat dish. Meat us usually baked in the oven on racks or bar-b-que. I rarely go for seconds; we eat off the small dinner plates I think some call them salad plates anyway they are not the saucer size. I've been thinking maybe I should start eating off a saucer. I drink lots of water. Soda Pops; chips; cookies; candies; pie or cake as a whole I do not keep in the house on a regular basis. At night I usually get a sweet tooth ..sigh.. I usually have a half a apple and some dates. Any advice on how to keep my weight down?,2007,2008,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For the last two weeks my hands (the palms and between my fingers)will begin to itch periodically without warning. When I scrath them it only gets worse; the itching is intensified and they begin to burn. I have tried multiple things to relieve it but to no avail. It starts and stops continully through out the day and there is no one indicator of what might be causing it. I am worried that it might be my liver or gallbladder due to stones in my gallbladder. Or could it be decreased tissue perfussion to my hands? I know just enough to get into trouble and am concered about this due to the fact that I have tried everything and it does not seem to go away.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Since May I have been having severe dizzy or lightheaded feeling like I will pass out; but I don't. Combined with being extremely nauseas and very bad diarrhea. It comes out of nowhere. I could just be sitting at work and an episode will happen. It seems so hard to explain what is happening. First; I will feel a bit dizzy and nauseas; then I will have to run to the bathroom because the diarrhea hits me and I feel like while I'm going to the bathroom I will pass out; then the nausea and dizziness with cold chillls and then I am hot so I have to take the sweater off that I put on because I was cold. I am 30 years old and I have a mild case of lupus that has been under control with plaquinil over the past ten years. My Obgyn took me off of birth control pills in August because she thought that was what was causing this; but I still have the episodes and they are getting closer and closer together. I had an MRA and MRI in September that both came back normal. My neurologist has put me on neurontin three times a day; but that isn't helping either. I can not funtion my normal like and every time it goes away I hope it's for good; but then it comes back and I can not figure out why. I am not drinking any alcohol either. Please give me some advice because I am tired of missing work and time with my family. Thank you.,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I bet Stella knows this (?); but it's also a poll / question for any that have it - so please respond; its a rare question! My question comes up after I was reminded that T3 is converted via the liver on another post. Thyroid is linked with so much other stuff its hard to keep track! I; like many here; might have a T4 to T3 conversion problem that does not show on the lab tests. I dont know how a conversion issue is proven; is there a way? My docs dont seem to know or care about conversion. All I know is I feel somewhat better with T3 in dessicated and I am driven to find out the very reason. Below may or may not be the reason why. I just had a AMA comp panel (physical); and for years my Bilirubin is over the range (double!). Doc always brushes off the high Bilirubin since the other liver tests are OK. This has something to do with the liver and Juandice. My other liver tests (Alkaline Phosphate; AST and ALT) have always been and still are in the middle range; they are OK!. There is a name for this unbalanced condition. My question(s): 1) Does anyone else have high Bilirubin with Hoshi's and have the other liver tests in range? 2) Anyone no what high Bilirubin has to do with the Liver converting T4 to active T3 in a Hoshimoto Hypo person? Thanks; getting educated on this for my next appt if need be. I will admit I don't know much about the liver; but I know enough to take it easy on Tylonel (and booze)! Moose,2009,2009,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have had reoccurant uti like symptoms for a few months..all my cultures show no infection just white blood cells..I've seen a urologist who did a bladder ultrasound and cystoscopy both normal..I saw my gyn who did a pelvic ovaries were normal..he did not give me a ultrasound though..should I persue further testing since this could be a symptom of ovarian cancer? I am 30yr..also I did have a pelvic ultrasound 6 moths ago for something else and my ovaries were normal size.,2002,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My sister inlaw is a adopting a new born; the mother's didn't have any amniotic fluid for several weeks. The baby is discolored; like a grey look; because it sat in the mother's womb without fluid. Is this normal? The doctor's claim that the baby is healthy. Will the baby get her color back to normal and when? Is there anything we should be aware of about the baby? Would the baby have lived in species? We are very concerned about the newborn. Thank you;,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Has anyone had the Mirena IUD and had it removed to ttc. I am just curious how long it took you to conceive after Mirena IUD removal? How long until your menstrual cylces were regular? I got my IUD out on Aug 5th and am ttc. I have had lots of spotting and maybe a period but nothing regular. I called my doc and they said that it takes 3 months before the hormones are out of your system. The mirena website makes it sound as though you can get pregnant anytime after removal. Any advice/stories would be appreciated. Thanks.,2006,2006,,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am having some symptoms of being pregnant(weight gain; breast swelling and tenderness; mood swings) but I have taken several tests that show negative. Also; for the last 2 months my periods have been at least 4 days late and really light; and I am having discharge throughout the month. I was diagnosed with endometriosis about 3 years ago; but since my surgery none of the dr's have been concerned. I did have abnormal cells show up on a pap; but the biopsy turned out ok. I'm not sure what the problem is; and I have sceduled an appt; but is there anything I can do until then?,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I started my period last week. It went on for the normal 5 days;stopped for a day . Now it's back again I have had it for almost 3 weeks now. I am very tired . Has it got something to do with the blood loss.,2005,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have started Phentermine and B12 shots once a week. I went today for my first week weight check and my second shot.....my weight loss for my first week is 9.5 pounds!!!!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,My husband fell on his penis when he was younger while at a skating ring- he is now 20. Ever since then; he had a indention above his penis. Another symptom is that his penis retracts into his body when his adrenaline gets going. He would literally have to pull it out before it goes all the way in. I have tried looking up these symptoms but only found one thing called "Penis Panic" pretty much saying that its a beliefe where men think their penis is going to retract into their body and disapear. Well; this def is not something in his head; lol... really happens. Anyone else heard of this? He went to the doc- the doc is going to call him back cause he doesnt know what it could be. Thanks in advance; Shannon,2007,2007,19,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,It's been almost 2 weeks since my laproscopic surgery; I have learned alot both from experiencing it and talking to ya'll here on the forum. Time to share; because just maybe somebody is about to go through the same thing and has questions or needs help. It would be great if everyone added their two cents and we will have a nice "what to expect when your expecting laproscopic surgery" list...lol 1. Don't be fooled; this is major surgery. You could be having body parts removed. Don't plan on doing much for at LEAST a week or two. If you are lucky like some; you'll be up and at 'em. But if you're not; then you won't be disappointed and frustrated. 2. Make or buy muffins. Especially bran. You will need them. Don't ask me why. Ok...why? Because your meds will constipate you and make your stomach hurt. AND you will be too tired to make food. You can buy stool softeners too; but they don't make for a tasty breakfast... 3. If you can; shop for or prepare food and stick it in the freezer. And be REALLY REALLY nice to your friends and neighbors before your surgery. They may offer to bring you food. Don't be silly; say yes. You will be glad you did! 4. The CO2 gas may bloat you up. It might not happen for a day or two and you will laugh and say "I am SO lucky!!" and then "POP" You are the now the Pilsbury doughgirl. Only not as cute. But it hurts...not just the shoulder; could be all over. WALK; WALK; WALK.. around the house; it will go away. Could take a week or more; but the worst is the first few days. Try beano; mylanta; etc. too. BEST cure: Massage. Takes away all the toxins; pushes out some gas. Can't get one?... be REALLY REALLY nice to your spouse; significant other; children; whoever.... they may take pity on poor ol' bloated you and help you out. 5. Get one of those beanybag things that you put in the microwave. Put it on where it hurts. Warm feels nice and you can't get in the tub for two weeks. Your body might hurt all over. They say they don't drop you off the stretcher while you are unconscious; but I personally don't believe it... 6. Enjoy your downtime. Remember all those busy days you wished you could lie around; play on the computer; read books; organize your photos; google your old boyfriend; write that novel? Well; do it. Or sleep. Or both. 7. Sleep. Sleep some more. 8. Driving sucks. Try and avoid it until your incisions/stomach muscles don't hurt. (and you're not on happypills anymore...) It's illegal in most states to drive lying down; I believe... 9. Drink lots of water. Flushes out all the stuff they pumped into you during surgery. Fluffs out the sleep wrinkles in your face.. 10. Get on this forum when you can. You will find wonderful women with supportive notes; messages; laughs; and you can read others stories to know whether you are "normal" or not (in terms of your surgery - if you want deeper analysis; try the psych forum...) That's MY top ten; I hope you all can add a few of your own! Thanks everyone for ALL your help; info; and especially the friendship and laughter. Have a great day! Joelle,2008,2008,47,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I wondered if anyone who had had a laparoscopy could tell me how long it hurt for. I still feel quite alot of pain when walking after a week and wondered if that is normal; as everywhere I read that people resume normal activities after a couple of days. I am not doubled up or anything; its just like having a constant stitch; and when i take a step; especially around my belling button there is a kind of sharp tugging pain. Also some stabbing pains too that just seem to happn even when sitting still. Just wanted to know if this is usual; I expcet it is; but thought I would ask others who had had similar; who might tell me how long until the abdomen feels normal again. Thanks,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Two weeks ago around 6pm I had an episode of multiple symptoms that precipitated very quickly; within about three minutes; without warning. These included feeling very weak; shaking all over; light headed/dizzy;numbness/tingling on fingertips and toes; slight shortness of breath and chill. I felt like passing out; flushed. I figured it was from not eating so I grabbed a burger and it seemed to alleviate the problems. Well; it happened again around the same time of day a few days later. But this time; eating didn't help as much. Eventually the symptoms went away. My colleagues observed that I looked very pale. Since then; I have been experiencing episodes every day in the evening. I keep a pile of energy bars in the office and gulp one down at the very first hint of weakness; shaking; which seems to go away in about ten minutes. If I don't; the symptoms quickly intensify until I am so shaky and weak that I can't remain in a sitting position. I've had blood/urine test and was told all is ok. Here's the curious part. Last two days; instead of gulping down an energy bar; I've been taking Vitamin B-12 that dissolves under the tongue. This seems to help alleviate the symptoms as well as the energy bar. Any thoughts or guesses on this will be gratefully appreciated. Thank you,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi For several months I have been getting this weird sensation that my skin is crawling. This happens just behind my right shoulder blade in exactly the same place every time. It generally happens for no reason that I can fathom. It is a sort of itching sensation and then a sensation that there is something crawling under my skin. When I rub it with my fingers it disappears for a while but inevitably it returns within a few minutes. There is no pain involved. Would be interested to find out if there is a medical explanation for this! Many thanks Lola,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just started Topamax. I'm on 25mg/day and will increase by 25mg/week until I reach 100mg. I heard the weightloss effect depends on the dose. So; what dose did everyone here have their success? And what type of diet/eating plan and exercise plan did you do to help it along? I'm desperate to lose 40 lbs (half of which I gained on Zoloft-no longer taking). PLEASE respond if you had any weightloss on this drug; I'm very curious.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I was scheduled to get my period on July 22 or 23. on those 23rd I assumed I was getting my period because I start out with a brown discharge. But the that discharge is still here. When I wipe after going to bathroom sometimes the discharge is light on toilet tissue and sometimes I will get very light blood. I still have this discharge and I know if it was to be my period it should be over by now. Could I be pregnant. I took a pregnancy test last Monday and it came back negative but I don't have no signs of being pregnant either. Should I want til it stops and hope for a period next month; take a pregnancy test; or go to the doctor. This has never happened before. I don't know what this is. Hope someone can tell me.,2003,2005,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am 25 & am on Prednisone(60mg);salasapyrin(500mg)& Plaquenil(200mg) per day. I have developed a large moon shaped face. I am swollen in the face & neck & hate what it is doing to my face. Will this swelling & fluid go away when I come off the steroids in five weeks? It is causing me to be depressed & family have noticed the change in my face & are worried for my health. I have heard some scary things about these drugs; prednisone in particular. Please is there anything that can stop the Moon face & would I benefit from taking a dieretic too?? P.s I have had an eye twitch every day for the last 3 dys in my left eye; lasting for approx 20secs & about every 10 mins? Could this b another side effect & should I worry about it as it is annoying & starting to get sore? Thanks,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi! It's my first time posting--hello everyone! Just have a question that someone might be able to help with... Ever since I got married I have had a VERY regular 28 day menstrual cycle--never late; never early. We are trying to get pregnant; and today I am at least five to six days late for my period. I did a pregnancy test this morning that came up negative. How reliable is that result since I usually have such a normal cycle? I don't have any other symptoms besides frequent urination and butterflies in my stomach that could just be from the excitement of the whole situation. So I guess my question is whether or not it is "worth it" to take another pregnancy test; if so; when; or; what else could even be the cause of such a delay in my usually predictable period? Thanks for any comments; etc! Katie L.,2003,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?,2006,2006,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I'm a 35 year old male from the UK in otherwise good health. About 3 months ago I started having some weird symptoms/sensations. Firstly; I noticed a slight tremor in my left thumb; it only lasted a few seconds and I put this down to fatigue; as I'd been working out with weights. For some weeks after this my left hand felt tired and shakey; but without any loss of strength or actually shaking. I then started to experience intermitant sensations of what I can only describe as light numbness and pins and needles in both my hands and feet; but primarily on my left sided extremeties.I would also occassionaly get these sensations on a small area of my left thigh.These sensations regularly come and go; but last seconds rather than minutes/hours. In recent weeks the light numbness seems to have subsided but I have noticed that I regularly wake up during the night with either hand completely numb.This is rectified in seconds by wiggling my fingers; but the effected hand is left feeling weak for a couple of hours.I have also noticed a strange buzzing sensation under my left foot; that I can only describe as if someone was holding vibrating mobile phone against it. I have been to see my GP who seems to think stress or anxiety.Basic blood tests have come back normal. I apologise for the length of this post; but I would much appreciate any thoughts or advice as the where I go now. 1)does anybody know; statistically; how likely these symptoms are to be caused by some serious disorder ie ms. 2)Does stress/anxiety seem a feesible cause. 3)These symptoms are very light and the worry of what they might be is causing much more of a problem than the actual sensations. With this in mind; do you think it might be better to just live with these things and see if they die down of their own accord. Many thanks in advance.,2007,2007,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I just had my HSG done last week (after 19 months of ttc). She said the tubes were clear.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi! I am on my 11th day of being late for my period. The first day of my last period was sept. 23 and my periods are regular (28-30 day cycles).

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the "spot" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?,2008,2008,,Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hello; I have had many signs of pregnancy like; swollen and tender boobs; stomach cramps on the left side; constant diziness and a few light headaches. My last period started on May 13th and I started on June 12th with a very light period. I typically have very heavy periods and this time it is light. I have read all about Implantation bleeding and not sure if that is what I am going thru. I have heard many things and not sure which to believe. I have heard to wait 2 weeks after i stop bleeding to take a test; some say ok to test while bleeding and others say to wait a few days after I stop. Im not really trying to get pregnant but I would be happy if I was. Anyone have any advice? My periods have never been regular but my husband and I are stressed wondering if i am pregnant. Im thinking it wont hurt to test now while bleeding; in a few days after i stop and then maybe again in a few weeks. Thank you for all your help.,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi; I'm Quix. This is my story of finally getting a diagnosis of MS. If you have been worked up for MS and have a diagnosis - Whatever that dianosis is - Would you post below and add your story? Thank you. I am a 55 year old; white female. Seven years ago I was hit by intractable vertigo and; despite being treated by one of the world's foremost experts in vertigo; was forced to retire from being a pediatrician. I had very complicated problems in the inner ear on the left. But; eventually the problems spread to my right ear also. I was diagnosed with Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease. I was almost bedridden for a good portion of the first 4 years suffering from daily dizziness; nausea; poor balance with a lot of falls; and the worst fatigue I had ever sufferd. Remember I had trained in a huge county hospital and regularly spent 36 hours straight on my feet. The fatigue with vertigo is worse!! Two and a half years ago one morning I was putting on my shoes and socks and realized I couldn't lift my R leg onto the other to put on my socks. I could barely lift it off the ground. I saw my internist who noted pathologically hyperactive reflexes on both knees and ankles; weakness of the R hip flexors and referred me to the neurologist I had seen before for migraines. The neurologist who I already knew thought I was a crock; examined me and found mild extensor spasticity in my right leg - mainly at the hip. He sent me for an MRI w and w/o contrast of my brain and spine. Next visit he said the MRI's were completely normal. There was an UBO (Unidentified Bright Object) in the brain; but that this was inconsequential. He said it definitely wasn't MS and that I was too old for it anyway. He sent me home. Dx Vertigo and Spasticity- mild. Later I discovered in his notes that he thought I was faking the weakness. During the next year I was dieting and lost 50 pounds slowly; but developed intermittent urinary incontinence. (losing weight is supposed to help that!) I also became much more fatigued than I was before; but wrote that off to being so deconditioned by spending all day in my recliner. Also; after years of living in the desert; became severely sensitive to even mild heat in my apartment. It made me weak and irrationally irritable. I was trying to get in short daily walks. One day it was a little warmer than usual and I couldn't make it home due to sudden weakness in both legs. I was terrified; and a neighbor had to help me home. Some months later I had a couple weeks of a weird sensation of warm water running down my right thigh. It would happen off and on all during the day. Each time I was sure I was being incontinent; but nothing was there! I went back to the neuro a year after he had seen me before. He repeated the MRI and did the complete battery of blood tests for the causes of myelopathy (disease of brain and spinal cord) Again the MRI was normal and so were all the blood tests. He appeared annoyed by my return to see him. He called me and asked "if I WANTED a spinal tap." This was implying that I was faking the problems and just wanted to get medical procedures. Yeah; right... Last summer (2006) suddenly one day I could not lift my right arm even to touch my throat. It was completely useless for about 36 hours; got a little better over the next week; but still felt weak and so fatigued. When I tried to use my right hand it felt foreign as if I was trying to use someone else's hand. It slowly improved over the next couple months. Even so I was left with residual weakness at the shoulder. Meanwhile I'm dragging my right leg; because it never got better and lurching about like a drunk sailor. So tired that I stopped leaving the house. My sister came to live with me; because I could not handle the house and errands. I became seriously depressed. It was several months before I could get my mental strength and courage to research my own problems. My self-esteem was non-existent. By the end of 2006 I knew the only neurological disease that fit my symptoms of weakness; spasticity; parathesias; bladder problems; fatigue; heat intolerance; and the now two attacks of problems that came; stayed and then slowly resolved was MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. All the other possible entities had been ruled out (this is critical in the daignosis of MS if the findings aren't perfectly classic) The problem was that my MRI was normal and I was too old at 54. You can suspect MS; but you cannot diagnose it without at least 1 brain or spine lesion on MRI. I went to the MS Society website and looked for MS specialists in my area. I found one; made an appointment and my GP was very agreeable to making a referral. The new neurologist was wonderful! Intense; smart and thorough. In retrospect he made the diagnosis of MS on that first visit. He stated that calling the spot on my MRI a UBO was laughable. It was classic for an MS plaque (well-circumscribed; oval; perpendicular to the ventricles ). He was also stunned that my other neuro had not pushed hard for a spinal tap. That is the next step when the MRI is not diagnostic. He prescribed Provigil for the fatigue (miracle drug for me) and repeated another MRI of brain and spine. He also ordered the spinal tap which I had under fluoroscopy guidance. It was absolutely painless and without complications. Those MRI's didn't show any definite new lesions; but he was very suspicious of two little areas on my cervical spine. The tap was positive for an elevated IgG index and I had only one (of course) oligoclonal band. They like to see 2 or more. The cell count was lost! Based on a physical exam which showed a huge amount of existing spinal cord disease; a single plaque on my brain; the normal blood work up for myelopathy; and suggestive findings on the spinal tap he made the diagnosis of MS. He said it wasn't a "slam-dunk" diagnosis; but he was at least 90% sure. He; and many opther experts in the field; feel that for many people the MRI machines are just not sensitive enough. They improve every year or two. His concern was than in just 2 years; I was already very disabled. I've had intensive physical therapy and still required a brace on my R leg and I need to use a cane. The disease was/is progressing fast. He put me in the category of Relapsing Remitting only because if I had a progressive type I should have many; many more brain lesions; but my disease is acting more like the rarest type called Progressive Relapsing. In my reading late onset MS is often marked by faster progression of disability and more by motor dysfunction than by sensory problems. This fits with what I have had. So this was my short course to diagnosis. Not nearly as horrific as it has been for many of you; but it has been devastating to me. The scary loss of function; the not knowing why; and the anger at being dismissed and discarded by my doctor. Ya know; the vertigo had been quite enough.... I'm now two months into therapy with Avonex. I'm through a new relapse (my fourth in the 30 months). A repeat MRI of my C-spine and T-spine with one of the newest generation of MRI machines which has a more powerful (3 Tesla) magnet showed half a dozen old spinal lesions which were missed by the previous older machines. I'm having constant electric shocks down my left leg when I flex my neck. Dozens of times a day. It's called L'Hermitte's Sign; and it is common in MS; but new to me. It is felt to indicate upper spine lesions that press on normal nerves when the neck is flexed. So I; too; am a Stanger in a Strange Land. I hope that here on the forums I can learn from you and share some of my understanding of how things work from 23 years in medical practice. Quix,2006,2007,55,Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Hi guys!! I am so afraid this is what I am going through. Those of you who have had missed miscarriages; did you continue to have pregnancy symptoms even though the baby had died? I am still nauseous but have no breast tenderness like I did with my son. I am afraid of the answer but need to know. Thanks,2003,2003,,
Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I am having extremely debilitating anxiety right now. Mild chest discomfort but I focus in on it so much that it becomes unbearable. I am always aware of my heartbeat and like above I focus in to it where it just drives me insane. I am expereincing undescribable levels of discomfort and I just dont understand whats wrong with me. My heart rate throughout the day is 90-100 bpm resting; and it shoots up even when I do simple tasks such as walking. Ive been to a cardiologist and they did several tests and said everything was there and in working order but my pictures were "blurry" so that definately just increased my anxiety 10 fold. A long with this; I was told to wear a hear monitor for a month which did nothing except increase it even more; and I did not even wear the monitor in the end. The strangest symptons though are just constant vibrations or movements in my intestinal area; bad heart burn; bad gas; and a feeling like I have to burp but just cant. Im hoping that my heart is fine and the feelings are just from my focusing on it too much; but I just dont know. Can anyone relate to this? Its been 3 months and I cant even sleep anymore.,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,For years I have been "suffering" from excessive dreaming. I have dreams that are extremely graphic; detailed and vivid. Most of the time I am aware that I am dreaming and cannot wake up. It does not occur every night; but several nights a week. I wake up feeling EXAUSTED. I nod off during the day; cannot keep my eyes open. Last night (for example) I got 8 hours of sleep and yet today I'm so tired I could cry! I should also mention that I fall asleep almost instantly and I dream as soon as I fall out. There are some days where I "fall asleep" here at work and begin to dream instantly; it's almost as if It's an instant hallucination. My husband says I'm lucky to fall asleep when I hit the pillow but I'm to the point where if sleeping makes me THIS tired I don't want to. The dreams are often traumatic and I'm tired anyway. What's the point of sleeping?! I'm not suffering from depression and I have a regular schedule in terms of sleep (Usually get at least 6.5 - 8.5 hours a sleep). My diet is pretty good and I get an average amount of excersize. Everything I do is in moderation (no drugs either; btw). Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Simple question here; has anyone ever had a negative blood test and negative urine test and went on with their daily routine and a month or so later found out you were in fact pregnant while having ultrasound done. If this has happened to anyone or perhaps someone you know; please respond; I'd appreciate the information. Thanks. ms_smiles,2005,2005,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,Can a Vitamin D deficiency cause this much pain? Went to the doc for muscle pain & weakness with increasing shooting pains to the point of affecting everyday functioning. Blood test came back low in Vitamin D. Result was 11; (should be 26 to 55). Other results OK. Cervical Spine & lower back MRI OK. Treatment is 50;000 units of D per week for 4 weeks and thereafter once a month. Been on it for 4 months. Feel at times like I was in accident.Have researched on the net; and still find it difficult to believe that this can cause this much suffering. Anyone familiar with anything like this?,2006,2006,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,I have experienced on 4 occasions in the last 6 years a rather weird Diarrhoea attack which really is painful and scary. Here is a description of what occurs. 1. Sudden abdominal pain which increases in intensity over a short time. The same sensation one might get when they are about to get Diarrhoea. 2. I go to the toilet and try excreting whatever wants to come out. However after about a minute of sitting there with nothing coming out I suddenly few light headed and am starting to get a dizzy spell like I am about to faint and my breathing weakens. 3. This borderline fainting sensation lasts for about another minute before I break out into a sudden sweat all over my body. Within a few seconds I have sweat literally pouring out of me; my clothes are wet as if I ran a marathon or something. 4. After a minute of sweating I suddenly feel something coming out of my rear end. I try to squeeze it out and only a hard stool comes out. 5. The sweating stops and the stomach cramp subsides. I think everything is over and I clean up. I walk out of the toilet and in about 2 minutes time the stomach cramp and the fainting sensation comes back (I've fainted only once to date from this and was out for about 15-20 minutes). 6. When I get back to the toilet I have a really violent Diarrhoea episode in pure liquid state. It takes a few minutes to subside and once I,2007,2007,,

Metformin+diabetes+type+2,In May I began to have dizzy spells which coincided with a sore throat and earache; which cleared up on their own. However; dizziness and fatigue continued for several weeks. The dizziness resembled being carsick; with lightheadedness and occasional moments of nausea and feeling faint (but I never passed out). I had a CAT scan and blood work twice; and so far no diagnosis for the dizziness/fatigue. It got better for a few weeks but last week I began to have dizzy spells again; this time accompanied by maxillary sinus pressure. I had just switched allergy medications; from Nasonex to generic Flonase; right at the time my symptoms returned. Could allergies have led to a sinus infection? Can the sinus infection cause dizziness and fatigue? Due to the holiday weekend I haven't been able to call my doctor; but after 3 prior visits he's never suggested sinuses to be a cause.,2006,2006,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,the medicine i take for hypertension is no longer being produced. It contains 2.5 mg of amlodipine and 50 mg losartam potassium. can you suggest a medicine that contains these in the same proportion; please?,2012,2012,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40,Female

However; my resting pulse rate has consistently been in the 90's and increasing into the 100's at time; so I have been prescribed Carvedilol to help control the heart rate.

Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male

The medicine was prescribed in the same dose by general practice doctor 2;5 months ago . In the meantime I did ultrasound of the heart and the result seems to be OK. as wel as EKG. In addition to hypertension I have high cholesterol values(Tested on 20/03/2009: Choletsrol was 5;6; LDL= 3;5 ; HDL =1;42; b on 05/05/2009 i did another test in different lab; results were Cholesterol= 6.9; LDL=4;90; HDL=1;20. I do not take any drug for cholesterol;have started using fermented red rice. I am still smoking. " Lodoz"2;5 mg seems to control my blood preasure fine. I don't have problems with heart rate (usually between 70 and 80 during the day and around 60 in the morning) before taking beta blocker I usually had quite high HR (approximately 90) I'm writing all this because it seems that I started to suffer from "Erectile Dysfunction"or at least everything seems to be pretty much different than before. Behavior has been changing during period of taking drug. In the meantime I was reading a lot and would appreciate professional help;advice; suggestions and comments. I have found out that there is not easy to stop taking "BETA BLOCKERS" if needed it has to be gradually. I wonder would it be worth of trying switching to other BETA BLOCKER that is more selective such as "NEBIVOLOL". ; could I switch to ACE inhibitor (was taking one 5 years ago; they were working for me at that time as well.My blood pressure was then marginal and quit after about month and a half) or maybe should I switch to something like "LOSARTAN" Thank You very much for help in advance Kind regards; Bruno,2009,2009,,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear. But im wondering now if it was from this pulmonary hypertention...???? All the articles im finding on PH says it is fatal and always progresses!!!,2015,2015,32,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,My 40 year-old wife in recent months has undergone a number of tests following some weight loss. It transpires that she is suffering from hypertension with her 24hr ambulatory readings averaging at 170/110. Further diagnostic tests (ECG; echo and cardiac MRI) were undertaken and her cardiologist told her that her heart is enlarged (moderate) with impaired function (I believe ejection fraction in the region of 45%) but has not been able to identify the root cause of the hypertension. She is asymptomatic and does not have any issues in terms of fatigue; breathlessness; swelling; etc. She has been prescribed 5mg Amlodipine; 5mg Ramipril and 2.5mg Bisprolol. The Cardiologist has told her she will be on medication for longevity and that improving the condition will take a long time. Her blood pressure has already come down to 132/84 which the cardiologist was very pleased with. She will be seeing him again in 8/9 weeks with a follow up echo in 4/5 months. In terms of the diagnosis; the cardiologist has referred only to hypertension but having read and aligned the symptoms of the enlarged heart and impaired function; is it not heart failure.....? Also; what is the prognosis for an enlarged heart caused by hypertension; especially in someone of 40 years of age.....can the enlarged heart and function return to normal over time with the medication?

Amlodipine+hypertension,Thank you all that have shared your stories and journey with this disease. I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with hypertension with kidney failure? Harley's bp are high and he's on the highest doses of medication they can give him. Because of the hypertension and now a heart murmurs the vet feels that giving him subq fluids will do more harm than good. Has anyone else found a way to balance fluids with hypertension? His creatinine level is 3.8; BUN is 96 and phosphorous is 9 all which have doubled in the past week and with BP's around 160/100. He's on encard; enalapril; Amlodipine; Epakatin and Pepcid. My little guy Harley was first diagnosed with kidney disease when he was 5; he is now 13 wow! He was asymptomatic for 8 years; our only intervention was diet. Harley is now getting to end stage; even though I know this would happen it's still so hard. Who knew that a 20lb beagle would be the love of my life. Thank you; Tammy,2014,2014,46,Female

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi doctor; Firstly thankyou in advance for your service. I am a 26 year old female; 125lbs 5'5''; non-smoker. I was diagnosed as having Hypertension when I was 23; no family history of any cardiac problems. I had all the routine tests to rule out secondary causes and was therefore diagnosed as having essential/primary hypertension and commenced on Losartan; my BP remained uncontrolled running about 150/100 and throughout numerous months my medication was changed; finally settling at 100mg Losartan and 10mg Amlodipine which kept my BP controlled at around 120/70. I have recently had a baby and my BP again became very uncontrolled at the end of pregnancy and I was induced; my BP remained high after the birth between 140-160/100-110 and 4 weeks later I had a suspected TIA were I lost feeling down my left side and had diffilculty speaking; this episode lasted around 2minutes in total. I have since been under going routine tests to confirm or rule out a TIA and was commenced on aspirin. The MRI and Carotid artery ultrasound were negative and the Echo/TOE (TEE) showed my heart was fine except the presense of a 'small hole' my doctor said the hole is very common and that they do not think there is any need to close it. My questions to you are: Is it likely the small hole is a PFO? Could there be any relation between the PFO and my unexplained hypertension in someone my age? Is the presense of a PFO enough evidence to confirm a TIA? Would Hypertension and a PFO increase the risk of stroke/TIA in the future? What would be your advice? Thankyou.,2008,2008,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi. I am a 53-yr-old female and live in the mountains of Colorado at least half of the year (for the last 13 years) at 10;000.' I have been an extremely strong athlete to the point of climbing very briskly up to Base Camp on Mt. Everest in 2003. Over the past couple of years; I have become increasingly out of breath with exercise at high elevations. I have had several ECGs done and they look excellent although borderline Pulmonary Hypertension is being considered and I'm going to have an exercise catherization done. I've spent the last 3 months on oxygen but do not need it at sea level. My internist in Chicago believes I'm having an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise and hi altitude (my bp is much higher up there) and recently told me that he has a patient who lives both in Chicago and in Aspen and has a similar issue. His cardiologist in Aspen put him on Norvasc; saying that it is specific for altitude induced hypertension. A cardiologist that I saw on Friday at the Cleveland Clinic could not confirm this. Any feedback to this question? I'm pretty desperate to get back to life as I once knew it!,2012,2012,,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 63 yr old female who has recently been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and hypertension. I haven't really experienced any overt symptoms of hypothyroidism beyond dry skin and possibly "brain fog" (after reading some of the comments of other posts - I think I can identify with that!). My TSH was extremely high (52 -- normal lab values to 2.5) and can't figure out why I didn't have more symptoms. My BP in Dr's office was very high - 177/90. Since then I have followed it at home for a week and have found only about 1 high reading a day of about 136/79 with 4 or 5 readings of about 117/74 with occasionally much lower readings. I've been on Lisinopril 20mg for 7 days and Levothyroxin 50 mcg for 4 days and feel "strange"-- sometimes light-headed and weak. Is it possible to connect the elevated BP and hypothyroidism and is it possible to have a TSH value that high and not experience more hypothyroid symptoms?

Amlodipine+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter. The Heart Center website contains a directory of the cardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem.,1999,1999,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate. Any advice would be helpful. 30 yr female; no children non-smoker; moderate drinker meds: 20 mg Amlodipine birth control pill potassium supplement 81 mg aspirin Thank you; S. Rosser,2008,2008,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,My BP was well-controlled on 100 mg Losartin and 7.5 mg Amlodipine; averaging around 125/68. At peak exertion; during a treadmill stress test recently; my systolic BP reached 215. My cardiologist subbed 5 mg Nebivolol for the Amlodipine due to what he described as exercise-related hypertension. I took this medication for a week and experienced a range of unpleasant side effects; including exhaustion; significant depression and reduced heart rate (mid-60s; compared with my normal mid-80s). I've been off the Nebivolol for five days; but I'm still experiencing these side effects. My heart rate has only come back to about 67-68. Given the half-life of this drug and the fact that I only took it for a week; these side effects seem excessive. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I see my cardiologist again on Tuesday; but in the meantime; I'm having a tough time concentrating at work and I'm very concerned. Many thanks.,2017,2017,,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,Ive been getting chest tightness/pain while exercising and was sent for stress exercise test. I didnt get the pain while doing this and the test was fine; nothing showing. I was put on ramipril as my bp was high. I was also given a glyceryl trinitrate spray to use when I got the pain and before exercise; now this stops the pain and tightness. I was recently put on amlodipine and stopped my ramipril. Now since starting the amlodipine I no longer get the chest pain.Im wondering if this could mean I do have angina and what further test should I ask for to confirm? Thanks Heather,2009,2014,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,About a couple of days ago I started having warm to hot knees but I don't really see any swelling; redness or pain. They just feel warm; sometimes hot to touch. The only thing I know is that I started taking Amlodipine 10 milligrams to manage essential hypertension. Is this a side effect of amlodipine? I don't see it in the package insert. Or is it a sign of arthritis? I'm 27 years old in a very stressful environment as an ER nurse in a rural area catering to more than 10 municipalities (we're the only tertiary hospital in the area) so I'm a bit overweight and frequently have elevated blood pressure at work. I try to maintain a healthy diet; my vitamin supplements are the following Vitamin C Vitamin B complex Multivitamin + Lysine (also includes some vitamin Bs) Folic Acid Ampalaya extract C-llium fiber I take these religiously. Vit C and multi vit in the morning; vit B complex and folic in the evening. Ampalaya extract and cillium every meals.

He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96).

They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday.

Amlodipine+hypertension,As from 22 Dec 2011; I had some discomforts consistent with high BP. Checked BP personally on an OMRON digital equipment which showed 98 /176. Doctor check and read 95 / 170. Had been taking Losar 25 (Losartan Potassium IP). Doctor increased the dosage to Losar 25x2 +Amlodipine Basilate 5mg. Still not much relief in the discomfort level. At random I have a kind of heaviness on my head; a feeling consistent with a person taking strong wine giving a post-feeling muscle pull on the face.(I do not drink or smoke). Also a kind of numbness is also felt at times. Discomfort or pain in the back and left side of head is felt (infrequent). Did an MRI Scan on 20 Jan 2012. 'Findings': T2 & FLAIR hyperintensities noted in bilateral fronto-parietal periventricular white-matter. (S/o Microvascular ischemic changes) Prominent Vircho Robin spaces noted in both basal ganglia and centrum semi-ovale regions. Ventricles appear mildly prominent. Cortical sulci and basal cisterns appear mildly prominent. Left maxillary sinusitis noted. (Can you kindly interpret this and how to proceed medically. Thank you.

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; First of all i would like to thank you or anyone for answering my question. I guess i have always had high blood pressure; recently at the doctors my blood pressure was 170/101 ; high? Yes; very high. I was given a medication; Amlodipine Besyl 2.5 mg tab. I was wondering if there are any great adverse side effects to this medicine? I know its good to take a healthy lifestyle to get my blood pressure down and it would just be good overall for everything. Would hypertension be one of the reasons to cause a sort of chronic fatigue? Also; if you know this; but does hypertension play a big role on your immune system or bodies ability to make antibodies?

Amlodipine+hypertension,My 3 1/2 yr old grandson has high blood pressure (180/120 when not on amlodipine); abdominal pain usually radiating from the umbilicus; extremity (usually leg) numbness to the point of occasional collapse; loss of appetite; weight loss; sometimes naussea and/or diarrhea. He has also had episodes of temporary blindness. This all began to manifest this summer (1 month after he turned 3 yrs. old). Prior to that he seemed to be a bright healthy happy child. In retrospect he may have been having intermittant spells of abdominal pain associated with this for several months before his first hospitalization in August 2007 as well as rapid onset (2 weeks) of a lazy eye in the spring of 2007 which may or may not be associated. He has now been hospitalized 4 times at Texas Children's Hospital. He has 5 doctors: pediatrician; renal; g.i.; neuro; and an opthamalogist. He is on Amlodipine daily; Zofran as needed; and most recently Periactin daily. He has had numerous head and abdominal CT scans with and without contrast; MRI's; Ultrasound; DMSA(?); 24 hrs. urinalysis; blood work. They can't find the cause of any of the symptoms. We've been through many diagnoses including acid reflux; psychosomatic pain for attention; Mesenteric Lymphadenitis; possible pheochromocytoma; inflammation of the brain and the latest is possibly abdominal migraines. Recently a friend's daughter was diagnosed with Addison's Syndrome and they have many of the same symptoms. Do you have any suggestions and in your opinion should we ask about seeing an Endocrinologist. One of the problems with so many doctors and Texas Children's Hospital is that each doctor seems to be just looking at their piece of the pie and have not yet all gotten together to compare notes.

Amlodipine+hypertension,2009: episodes of chest pain; leading to cardiac cath with diagnosis of Prinzmetal's . Was started on amlodipine 5mg daily; continuation of Benicar 40mg daily (for chronic hypertension) and aspirin 325mg daily. This was effective. April 2013: intermittent bilateral arm pain; starting near elbows and within 5 seconds or so; involves total arms; hands and fingers and fine motor movements totally impaired. This intense pain lasts about 3-5 minutes; episodes 2-4 times a week. Interventional Cardiologist ordered thallium treadmill test; and stated that no cardiac damage seen. Amlodipine changed to 5mg twice daily; nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg prn; L-Arginine 4000mg twice daily and red yeast rice 2 capsules daily. I do not eat red meat or fried foods. No relief of symptoms. Isosorbide dinitrate 30mg started; no relief. Changed to Isosorbide mononitrate 30mg; No relief. Developed hacking cough lasting 2 months after isosorbide mononitrate discontinued. From April 2013 to January 2014 the episodes occurred 2-4 times a week. Then I did not have any more spasms until March 17; 2014. Since then I have had at least five a week; three days ago; I had three episodes. I understand that there is provocative testing during cardiac cath that involves inducing coronary artery spasm to ID the offending artery; and then that artery can be stented. The spasm can be rescued by intravenous nitroglycerin. My Interventional Cardiologist will not do this. I have not had any CHEST PAIN since 2009. I am 72 years old; 5'5"; 145 pounds; and walk 3 miles a day; up and down hills. B/P controlled; triglycerides and cholesterol within normal limits. Cannot tolerate statins--makes my leg muscles too painful. My question: Can bilateral arm pain be referred from some other site than the heart? What are my options?,2014,2014,,Female

I do not really know much about the complications of hypertension or what can be done besides daily exercise. I have a prescription of AMLODIPINE BESYL 2.5 MG tablets. Are there any complications taking this medication for hypertension? I hear that it is bad to take medication because your body gets used to it.

Is there a cleaner medication with better results and less side effects. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I am desperate....,2017,2017,49,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 ; ie High normal .. I didn't panic and I started to work on my lifestyle but nothing improved . After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings was always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist because I was obsessed with the idea of being hypertensive at this age ; 24 . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal (ranging bet . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and live my life normally and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were always ideal most of the time until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! The chest pain and palpitations frustrated me and I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Heart Ultrasound ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) The doctor ended up diagnosing essential hypertension after excluding a 2ry one especially after I made a kidney Ultrasound which was normal also .

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi All - new on here. I have had three episodes of AF (July 06; Jan 08 and Feb 08); first treated with IV Flecanaide but the doctors are unwilling to use that again; so have put me on Amiodarone; Bisoprolol and Warfarin; on top of the meds I was already taking (Amlodipine; Losartan; Simvastatin); which seem to make me very tired and lethargic all of the time; and also very 'constricted' - even gentle excercise makes my chest tight and breathing difficult; and when I stand from sitting or crouching I nearly pass out. The consultant has discussed the topic of Ablation very briefly; but I think there are other tests they could do first? (treadmill; 48/72 hour heart trace) I should mention that I also have thickening of the heart wall muscle; which they are not sure about (could have been caused by hypertension or could be HCM) - I have had a cardiac MRI last month so that might help when I see the results. Can anyone shed any light or offer any suggestions about this? I was led to understand that the Ablation; if successful; could enable me to come off some of the medication I am on; which might let me get back to excercising normally again. I am only 50 years old and up to these latest episodes fit and active (golf; squash; cycling etc; none of which I can do atm); so all this is a bit of a pain as you can imagine. Any contributions gratefully received (financial ones VERY gratefully received!!) ;o) Regards Chris,2008,2008,50,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,My mom; 72 year old; female; with hypertension for 8 years (with medications; systolic 110-120). In May; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfain; she felt & suffered an acute subarachnoid & subdural hemorrhage. In Dec; she has open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS haemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Current Medications: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Given her near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue any blood-thinning therapy? 2. Are there any no problematic drug interactions with her medications? We are particularly concerned with some of the Atonolol’s side effects (i.e.; the potential to develop type 2 diabetes; and unsteadiness when walking leading to more falls.) Are there safer; just as effective alternatives to Atonolol for her? We are also concerned with the elevated dosages of Lisinopril & Omeprazole. With these dosages; our mother’s systolic blood pressure has been in the lower end of below 120. Should the dosage be lowered; what should that be ? Thank you.,2009,2010,,Female

(CAD operator). since i've been diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 21. before; my medication was lacipil 2mg. last year; my doctor change my medication to amlodipine 10mg. since my blood pressure isn't stable. yesterday; i had a medical exam and was found out on my ECG that i have an Incomplete Right Bundle branch block. i don't know what's the meaning of that but the doctor says that i'm fit to work; just continue with my medication. i've got some other findings like... Adynamic precordium;regular rhythm; AB 5th ICS LMCL; Normal S1 and S2; no murmurs; no skipped beat. i'm just worried with those words in the result... even though the doctor says its ok... could somebody explain the findings? thanks a lot!,2009,2009,24,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past six months I have been waking up with a pounding heart and numb hands along with a pain under both sides of my ribcage and a slight headache. I have taken my bloodpressure and it is 120/79. I went to see my doctor and he said; I had a slightly high blood pressure 135/85. He put me on Amlodipine Besylate 5mg. My pressure has been 120/ 80 since. I told him about the pounding heartbeat and he sent me for a stress test; which he said was normal. What could be causing the pounding heartbeat ? I also wakeup feeling weak and tired; but it seems to go away once I get out of bed. I am 54 and also suffer with anxiety disorder and agoraphobia; but I never had THESE feelings before. I take 0.5mg of Xanax before I go to bed. If anyone has any ideas what could be causing this please let me know. I also noticed that for no reason I get very tired all at once and feel very sleepy and then it goes away.,2008,2010,54,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,for about a week now i've noticed that i experience an acute loss or respiratory drive when i smoke; maybe just after a few drags or a few mins after i finsh smoking; first time it was very serious i had to get out of the car and force my self to breathe; later on i realised that the symptom is relieved by alcohol. and if i smoke and drink it doesn't happen; also it doesn't happen every time i smoke; just starts out of the blue. will like to know the cause and treatment. i am 34 male hypertensive and currently taking atenolol; amlodipine; moduretic and captopril to control my hypertension; don't knwo if it is a drug interraction; i am not sure cos at times i will smoke it doesn't occur. anyway have decided to quit; this is my second day off cigs; but if i can know the cause and treatment i might go on enjoying my cigs,2009,2010,34,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,I have recently been prescribed Verapamil for migraine prevention but I'm also taking Norvasc. Should these medications be taken together? The Norvasc was prescribed a number of years ago by a different doctor for Migraine prevention. It hasn't helped my migraines but I've continued to take it. Since they are both blood pressure meds; I'm doubtful I should take both.,2011,2011,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,My son started having "spells" Jan. 2012 where he would start throwing up; very pale and blotchy; dark circle under his eyes. We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS? Could AS be the "Pain" that my son is having that we can't see?,2013,2013,29,Female

Day 52 spotting again days passed minimal bleeding but not red brownish lasted for 3 days took duvadilan and duphaston since then. It will stop and few days after back with spottings only when I go up and down stairs. Then nearly 9 weeks had spotting led to cramping and minimal bleeding to light red bleeding. With some sort of a tissue comes out with it. Next day had my 1st meeting with the OB. Told her the situation and I had TVUS done and she said no trace of pregnancy. Here is the result of TVUS Impression: normal sized anteverted uterus with intact endometrium normal ovaries with corpus luteum on the right. (BTW; I have history of Ectopic pregnancy years ago and took my left fallopian tube). Going back; she just prescribed me with ferrous sulfate and continue with my previous mantainance meds LoSartan and amlodipine since I have diabetes and hypertension. And ask me to have my CBC since I'm bleeding and BHCG. Coz she said she couldn't see any sign of pregnancy. Or I already ad Early Miscarriage. Want to know if there's a chance that the TVUS had mistaken and Am still pregnant coz my abdomen is getting bigger and there are times it gets hard and my breast hurts with occasional hardness with a feeling of getting fever.

Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Doc; I am 20; and was found to have hypertension (140~160/90~110); and my diastolic was known to go up to 128...I was a regular blood donor for 3 years; so my hypertension was a sudden one... My doctor initially thought I had Thyrotoxicosis/Hyperthyroidism; because in addition to the sudden pressure; I had sweaty palms; tremors; eye-nipping and a systolic murmur... My TSH; T4 and T3 levels were normal... I also tested negative for Pheochromocytoma; Renal Artery Stenosis and Conn's...MRI/Ultrasound showed nothing significant; although my doctor thinks my adrenal glands look bulky... My tremors have since become quite bad...They tremble so badly I am actually aware of it. Sometimes my whole limb is trembling so badly; I feel my whole body tremble as well...And when Im nervous (Im taking a public speaking class; and I have to give weekly speeches); it becomes very bad; and I can't even hold anything; and my legs tremble too...And I get numbness in my fingers; and sudden pain in my legs for no reason... Last night when I went to sleep; I saw flashes of lights in fornt of my eyes for a few minutes; and I seem to occasionally drool when I lie down... I am now on Norvasc (Amlodipine) 5mg OD; and Diovan (Valsartan) 160mg OD...Pressure pretty well controlled... Could my initial TSH; T4 and T3 levels be wrong ie a false negative? Or could my symptoms be because of something else or due to my medication? By the way; the doctor wants me to get tested for Porphyria... Please advise. Thanks for your time; Doc!,2006,2007,,Female

At no time it has acceded the normal levels. My question is whether i should continue ASA 50 mg and Statin also;as my lipid s are very well in the normal limits. But i am told that Diabetics will be prescribed Atorvostatin and Asprin to be on the safe side.Is it so? Please advise me,2008,2008,65,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history? Thank you.,2009,2010,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 .. After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings were always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were Ok until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Echocardiogram ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY ) 5) Kidney Ultrasound ( No stenosis or Kidney issue ; so the Dr. excluded a 2ry hypertension ) He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?! Ahmed,2009,2009,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female

Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear All; I just stumbled on this website and I hope someone can help me. I am young (just turned 21!); but was diagnosed with sudden quite high hypertension (sometimes up to 160/128); which till today; doctors are adamant is caused by a secondary cause. But nobody can put a finger to what is the secondary cause. Have no family history; am female; and my BMI is 20. Have been a top student all this while; and have represented my state for national's in debate. Also active in public speeches etc. Lately; have started trembling real bad. Used to get trembling when I had to speak in front of public; but it goes away about a minute into speech. But now I tremble all the way; until the podium shakes; and even 15 minutes AFTER speech; I still tremble so badly I cant hold even a bottle of water. It affects mostly my left side of the body. Like yestedray; all through the day; my left thumb was trembling; even when I was resting my entire arm on the table. If I apply pressure to my thumb to stay still; I can see the vein (or whatever you call it) pulsating. Is this just a bad case of anxiety or is something wrong? One of the doctors was worried about my trembling; while another said "anxious people tremble". Tested negative for thyroid disorders; pheochromocytoma. Appreciate your time for reading this far. Thanks; and looking forward to hearing from anyone who would like to give their two cents. Cheerio!,2007,2007,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; Im 27; 250lbs; 5'-11" and I work out about 5 days a week; mostly cardio jogging and Anaerobic sprinting. My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor or doing? Im really worried that my heart will stop or that I have an underlying issue. PLEASE HELP!,2008,2008,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,I am using 2.5mg of Amlodipine (Calcium Channel Blocker) and 5mg of Bisoprolol(Beta Blocker) to treat my hypertension. I noticed when I took a calcium supplement that I felt real "hyper" and had heart races at night. I stopped the supplements but now I get the same reaction if I drink a large glass of milk. I also have side affects of reaccuring vivid nightmares. I have an upcoming physical; my doctor does not believe me. What other options do I have for treatment to get off the calcium blocker?,2011,2011,68,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I have recently been diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy. I was told I have mild left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. I am very overweight with a bmi of 41; male; 33 years old; and a smoker (trying to quit). I was put on metoprolol200 mg per day; amlodipine 10 mg; and since my high sensitivity c-reactive protein was 8.9; I was put on simvastatin 5mg. The medicine was controlling my blood pressure over the last couple of months but now it is not. I consistently run in the 150/95 range. My resting heart rate stays around 90. Is it normal for meds to just stop working; literally overnight? Should I be concerned about my risk of heart attack or stroke? Any advice is appreciated.,2012,2012,,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,First of thanks for everyone who reads your time is appreciated. I'm Anthony; 22 years old 6'3 220 pounds I try to stay active (gym; walking; jogging) every other day at the least. I was diagnosed with hypertension 7 months ago with no underlying cause. Sent me to a cardiologist; heart looked fine other than a mild leaky valve. Stress test went good I did it for 9 and a Half mins. Doctor Said I was healthy. I was put on Losartan 100/mg -Hctz 25mg shortly after my Bp was over 140/80 a couple visits to the doc. It now runs 135/75 when I check it usually sometimes 127; or 142 just depends I guess. I exercise; I eat pretty healthy; I'm young and I'm really wondering how to deal with this? I'm doing all I can; the doctor has me on meds at 22yrs old; I know of all the deadly outcomes of high bloodpressure and how it increases with age. How do my readings look? What more can I do to lower it ? I have no help so I'm hoping I can get advice. Godbless,2013,2013,21,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi Everyone; I'm 41 male with history of hypertension. My BP stays around 170/100. Highest was recorded 176/110. I have been on Telmisartan 40mg for few weeks but it killed my sex drive entirely. I stopped taking it & gradually recovered from low libido. Also i've noticed a general decline in libido & an onset of ED after i crossed age 40. Now my libido is not that strong as it used to be 4 years back even without medicine. I discussed this with my cardiologist & he says it must have been something else as ARB's don't affect libido. Now he has prescribed me a combination drug (telmisartan 40mg + amlodipine 5mg) once a day. I'm really worried if it would again target my libido in a negative way. Please share you experiences & expertise to combat this side effect that makes you life so dull & boring. All Suggestions are welcome.,2016,2018,42,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 20 and was diagnosed with pretty high hypertension (140~160/90~110) last year; of sudden onset. I am on Diovan 160mg (Valsartan) and Norvasc 5mg(Amlodipine); both once a day. BP is controlled most times of the day. Doctors initially thought I had thyrotoxicosis; as I had the symptoms and negative history for hypertension; and my BMI is 20.5. Tests showed normal levels of TSH; T4 and T3. My tremors of both hands; palpitations and sweaty palms are kinda getting more obvious. Morover; I seem to be getting cramps here and there; and my fingers get all tingly and numb. And I seem to urinating a whole lot more. Is it possible the thyroid tests were a false negative? Or could it be that the Valsartan I'm on is causing some deficiency in my body (like Potassium)? I tested negative for Pheochromocytoma. Please advise. Thanks for your time.,2006,2007,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,4 years back i got my urine examined. It was found to have protein content of 1550 mgs per dl. cretenine was 1.9. BP 150/100. With use of attenolol 50mg; Losartan Potassium 50mg Amilodipine 5mg and atrvestatin 10mg daily and control over sodium intake; i have maintained my BP as 120/80. Latest tests indicate 24hrs protein as 199mg/dl and createnine 1.4. I have one kidney which is mild hudronephrotic. Doctors do not advise any other treatment except controlling hypertension. What else can I do?,2008,2008,61,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,I am posting this for my 62 year old mother who generally feels well but has bouts of a condition that causes the following: -her head feel like it weighs 1000 pounds -terrible pain in her chest and this last time the pain was also on the right side of her lower back. -Her blood pressure spikes and her doctor puts her in the hospital; doctors have trouble stabilizing it once she gets to the hospital. She has been hospitalized 3 times in the last 3 years. The last time she was hospitalized it took 3 days to bring down her blood pressure which was at 180/120. Also the last time she was hospitalized in addition to chest pain she also had extreme pain on the right side of her lower back to the point where she could not bend over. She takes a daily dose of 20mg of Accupril and has for years. Except for when she has bouts of this condition her blood pressure is normal and she feels and looks very healthy. The attacks come without warning and no reason for them has been given. She feels absolutely awful when they come. She usually walks 3.5 miles per day and has for a year and feels well. After her last hospitalization she was sent home with Amlodipine Besylate 5MG. Each time she was treated she had a battery of blood work (numerous vials) in an attempt to find the cause. She was checked for a heart attack and also had a stress test. None of these have pinpointed a cause. She was also given needles to try and being down her blood pressure; I don't know the names of what they were. The pain in her chest is below breast; by rib cage. Each time she is sent home after her blood pressure is finally stabilized. After 6 months or sometimes a year it all comes back again without warning. The bouts seem to be coming closer together and more severe.,2009,2009,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,My T3 is 1.88 ng/mL; T4 is 11.5 ug/dL; and my TSH is 1.5 uIU/ml. Is there a reason for me to be alarmed. Should I see a doctor about this?,2014,2014,67,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather "sloppy" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms? Should I reduce it more slowly...over weeks or even months?,2011,2011,43,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the "world famous" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it "stabs and jabs"; another doctor called it "electrical discharge headaches"; another doctor called it "cluster headaches". A previous doctor prescribed "indomethecin"; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide. The pain is far beyond what any human should have to endure. .,2012,2012,49,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I have had 2 ECG's done; one back in January 2001 and the other just this week. 11 months apart. The first was fine; with no problems. The second (last week) shows 'Probable LVH' Now; I am concerned that this has happened with 11 months; I have been under alot of stress but blood pressure has been OK. I have found this out as I have recently been getting adrenaline rushes (sweats) after stabbing pains in the chest and general chest discomfort; mainly at rest in the evening. Should be I concerned as a 28 year old male?; not overweight - though big built and no family history of problems - More a fan of the pub than the gym to my disgrace. I figure that im not going to just keel over any minute; otherwise the doc would have taken more drastic measures than refering me to a specialist. Many thanks in advance.,2001,2001,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,Mom 72; Singapore. Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) Daily BP: B4 breakfast - 140 PM & eve- 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 19 year old otherwise healthy patient with symptoms that started about 5 months ago. My daily symptoms include racing heartbeat; palpitations; headache; dizziness; near-syncope upon standing; fatigue; nausea and hypertension. I have been tested for any thyroid problems; or endocrine problems and the tests came back normal. I am on Amlodipine 10mg daily for the blood pressure; but it is persistant and runs about 140/100 usually. I have had a 48 hour holter which showed a max HR of 176; min of 44 and normal sinus rhythm. Had a few EKGs that were normal except a short PR interval; echo was normal; and most recently had a tilt table test. Nothing was remarkable about the test until they administered sublingual Nitroglycerin spray; which prompted a HR increase from 86 to 140 bpm immediatly. All my symptoms came about at once and I nearly passed out so they stopped the test. Blood pressure stayed about the same throughout. My doctor was unable to attend so I am curious in the mean time about these findings on the test. My EP has suggested he thought it was probably Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia; but possibly POTS. Any thoughts?,2008,2009,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm 46 years old. I have been taking medication (Ramipril 2.5mg; Amlodipine 5mg) for essential hypertension for the past 7 years. Blood pressure is normal whenever I get it tested. Is it necessary to continue this medication for the rest of my life. My doctor says that any change or reduction of medication is to be considered only after regular and more frequent(daily) blood pressure monitoring. Presently I'm not in a position to get it monitiored. I'm given to understand that the blood pressure monitors available in the market are not very accurate which rules out my own taking blood pressure daily. .I've no other problems (like diabetes or obesity etc). Can someone throw some light on this please?,2009,2009,46,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system? I don't eat red meat or pork and I eat lots of veggies so other than diet; are there alternatives that could help me reduce my BP that I may not be aware of (other than exercise; which I do 7-days a week) and a low sodium diet?,2011,2011,42,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; my old tom cat who is 20 and arthritic and fairly deaf has recently gone suddenly blind. We have taken him to the vet who said he has hypertension (he was already on treatment for kidney disease) and he is now on amolodipine. The vet said he has responded well to the kidney treatment and seems otherwise healthy and should adapt to his blindness in 3-4 weeks. My problem is he has given up trying to find his litter tray/food/water and howls (he did this as he went deaf but it is now more frequent). He will stand up and urinate on anything he is sleeping on and I am constantly taking him to his litter tray/ food/ water (He is eating and drinking well once placed there but howls until I check his needs rather than trying to find anything himself). He is generally mopey. In the morning I have to bathe him as he has sat in his own urine. I guess my worry is that I should not be putting him through all this and he will be on his own most of the day as I work full time normally. I would really appreciate advice / guidance / opinion from anybody who has experienced similar. How long should it take for any signs of improvement? I dont want him to be put to sleep unless this is the kindest option for him as he is much loved; but equally I dont want him to suffer. Thanks.,2010,2010,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 62 years old and have been treated for high BP for over 15 years. I have been taking Toporal XR 25 mg. 3x qd; H ydrochlorathizide 5mg 1x qd for the last 2 years. I woke up Tuesday morning with my head spinning; very dizzy. I took my BP and it was 180/111 pulse 55. This whole week it has stayed between 160/100 to higher and the pulse lower than I have ever had. I went to the doctor; could not see my regular doc but saw the one handling urgent care Thursday. My left leg has been very painful for several months; worse behind the knee. She x-rayed my knee and saw arthritis ; which I knew was there. I have arthritis both kinds. Have taken 800 mg Ibuprofen for the pain; try not to take it often as I know it elevates BP and harmful to body. I also take aspirin; tylenol; and wear a Flector pain patch when it gets unbearable. I alternate with the pain meds dont take them the same days. The doctor put me on Tramadol for pain and made an appt. with my regular MD April 5th. I am scared because heart disease runs in my family; hypertension and stroke; some diabetes. I feel it would be wise for me to see my orthopaedist about my leg and see a specialist about my BP; cardiologist maybe. I have a heart murmur have since childhood; leaky valve; mitral valve prolapse. I also take meds for hypothyroid; depression (sertraline hcl); anxiety (PTSD); skelaxin; prn cyclobenzaprine (not with other meds); now tramadol hcl. Can someone validate my concern about waiting? Am I rightfully concerned or anxious?,2011,2011,62,Female

I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. The only thing that was slightly elevated was my cholesterol and doctor recommended me to exercise and do diet change. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it.

Amlodipine+hypertension,Recently I was dignosed with High Blood Pressure. My previous doctor recognized it was high back in December. I went to a doctor late in May. She diagnosed me with HBP. My readings have been like 156/85 and as high as 167/90. I have been on Benazepril since May. I have felt better ever since taking the medicine no doubt. Not one single headache and I generally feel better. My blood pressure had went down a little on my last vist. It was about 148/84. The doctor still saw the need to put me on another medication; so now im taking Benazepril and Amlodipine. And at times checking my BP myself it has been down to like 127/80. Im only 24 and thats what worries me. I have a family history of High Blood Pressue big time. My Grandad and Dad both had it. My Dads was so high; at the time they couldnt even maintain it. Im also overweight. During my first visit to the doc I weighed about 250 at 6 feet tall. Most of my fat is central; stored in my stomach. Since then Ive been working out and running. I was down to 226 during my last visit. Ive changed by diet up and have become more active. Besides adding another medication; the doc also did a bunch of bloodwork. My CBC and all blood work; including thryoid function and ALL of that other stuff was all normal. Except my urine test. A small amount of protein showed up in my urine. And she recommended that I get an Ultrasound of my kidneys and abdomen. I didnt have the money to get it done between the last 2 visits. And she still wants it done. She kind of worried me big time that somethine may be fatally wrong with my kidneys. It may be my kidneys causing my HBP. Or is it my HBP causing protein in my urine and kidney problems??? Im worried to death now; at only 24 years old. I have a bit of anxiety at times and dont really know what to think. Im having the ulrasound done in a week. What are the common reasons for the problems im having here. Im overweight and have a fam history of HBP. But could my one case be different?? Could my kidneys be failing?? Ive never had any problems really. I get sharp pains in my right side sometimes. Appendicitis was ruled out a while back. My sister also has problems like this as well. I never have problems urinating either. Except I go ALOT when I drink a ton of water or beer. But Ive always been like that. And my mom is like that too. So i never looked into that much. But anyone got any advice??? Should I be this worried?,2009,2009,,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,Going back and forth between the lung doctor and the heart doctor. I had so many test ran that finally they diagnosed me with Primary Pulmonary Hypertension. Thursday I had a right heart cather that showed I do not have PPH. We were going to fix the valve but they thought it would damage my lungs. In the mean time; I can't breath; my heart feels like it flip flops in my chest; chest pains; dizziness; swelling in my leg; fatigued and no activity at all due to the symptoms through out the day. The lung doctor says fix the valve and the heart doctor says fix the lungs. What am I to do. There is a leak but they dont feel it's big enough to do surgery. They found the pressure in my heart to be high and Im on meds but it's not helping my symptoms. Help!!!!!!!,2008,2008,35,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life. Please help;someone!,2012,2012,29,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,31/m 320 lbs. 5-11. current BP 170/90 Sodium intake has been reduced on balanced diet tested for diabetes; cleared. Had ECHO Cardiogram done; no issues found. I was diagnosed about 2 months ago with Hypertension. at that time my readings were average 160/80. I was prescribed Amlodipine 5mg once a day. the doctor insisted that i just stick to this medication. Since then I have had other symptoms such as dizziness; faint spells; racing heart beats and severe bathroom urges. I contacted them about this and they set up another appointment; but since it is a county health department it was about a month out. I have had to wear protective undergarments to bed because i wake up with damn sheets.(not soaked but like 1-2 ounces) after my last ER trip; they said my vitals were fine; a little high but fine. was checked in at 150/80. i am just curious of what to look out for. I had bathroom incidents about 10 years ago due to a car injury; but have been dry since then. My questions are: can this be greater than hypertension; and if so what could it be? and Can this be affecting my bathroom problems as well; or should i look at this as a separate issue.,2014,2014,31,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,Ok here it go's. Im really worried about my husband he is 35 years old and he is on 4 different blood pressure meds. He is on Lisinopril 10mg ; Atenolol 50mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Even with all theese meds his blood pressure is still way to high! It seems every doctor visit they add more meds. Ok I guess my question is; is it nessasary to be on 4 different blood pressure meds and is it safe? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :),2010,2010,28,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a male 40 years with slight hypertension for which I am taking S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg). My height is 5 feet 10 inches; weight is 75 kg. I had bad asthma for 2 years which was treated with asthalin inhaler but I no longer have it nor do I use the inhaler or any other medication for asthma. I am a software engineer by profession. Fitnesswise - I can do about 40 pushups and jog for 30 minutes non stop. I have two problems - dry skin and insomnia; listing them both since I am not sure if they are related. The dry skin problem is nothing new I have had dry skin (extreme dandruff) on scalp; beard; etc. but the problem has gotten worse lately. lately the skin under chin becomes reddish (raw) easily after shaving and burns slightly. The other major problem is that I seem to only be able to sleep when I am extremely tired (been without sleep for long time); I also get disturbed sleep; Many times I go to bed at 11 pm but only get sleep at around 4 am; I then wake up at around 1.30 pm. I get very realistic dreams and disturbed sleep; nose gets blocked at night sometimes. After waking up - I dont feel very rested; I have difficulty concentrating; eye lids feel heavy; lazy. I saw a doctor who conducted some tests for the sleep issue. According to the tests - Vitamin; E; D count is low; triglyceride and esinophil count is slightly high. Bp; Sugar; ecg; thyroid are normal. The doctor recommended vitamin D; E supplements and some tablets for the esinophil which I completed the entire course. Another doctor recommended sertagress - 25 (Sertaline HCL 25 mg) and Ativan 1 mg (lorazepam 1 mg) tablets which I took for 6 months but they were not helping; had nasty side effects and I still had sleep issues; thus I tapered them off over 3 months. I am no longer taking sertagress or any sleep medicine. During school time the doctor diagnosed sleep issue to be caused by high blood pressure (hypertension) He recommended S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg) tablets which I am taking even now and since 15 years. My blood pressure is almost always around 130-90. the aggravagated insomnia problem is there for almost 2 years now. Recent health checkup reports are present in the url below. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B66Im30kB_hoRnh2YWF2cFJZUUU?usp=sharing Please advise me. I will be most grateful if something works. Thanks; Conrad.,2016,2016,38,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I was told about a year ago that the walls of my left ventricle were slightly thickened. I had a full cardiac workup done. I had extensive blood tests; stress test; echo; holter monitor and ecg. A few months later another echo and then the test were they go down your esophagus to look at the heart. I can't remember the name of it. The last tests showed that the thickness had come down close to normal. The cardiologists I had seen told me I may have had a virus or high blood pressure that caused the problem. Anyway they told me I should be fine and to go on with my normal life and I should not have any problems. My question is that I have done some bodybuilding and am very active. I am 26 with normal blood pressure and cholesteral levels and I do not smoke. I was wondering if I am at a risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest because of this. I have had a lot of anxiety over this and have some skipped heart beats now and then. I am worried when working out or when I am active I am going drop dead. Am at high risk because of the thickened ventricle walls?,2009,2009,25,Male

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi Doc(s); I am 26 yr old guy having high blood pressure since 2.5 yrs back. Doctors advise me to go for some baseline tests. One year back; by God's grace; my tests were absolutely normal. There was no cause relating to my BP. I am on NEBIVOLOL 2.5 mg & S-AMLODIPINE 2.5mg from last two years. My BP always remains between 130/90 - 160/90 mm Hg. No signs or symptoms are visible at the time of BP increasing time. I just track by BP for personal reasons. Now; I just want to know: What are the chances for it to be of Essential Hypertension? What are the guidelines i should follow and tests i must undergo? What are the side effect of the medicine i am consuming? Should i replace my medicine witth any other more suitable drug? and; What will be the chance of realting my High BP to any particular disease? Please comment on my above concern. With regards; SRQ,2009,2009,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries "clamped down" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and "improper" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial. I had no insurance when I had the heart attack (husband was out of work and just got a new job) and there is a 9 month waiting period for anything pre-existing... My question is... since I have already had a heart attack from vasoconstriction am I more likely to have another from it?,2009,2012,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I had hyperthyroidism for 2-3 mths duration; also hypertension due to hyperthyroidism. Initial presentation: (Date:29/4/15) FT4 45.5pmol/L (12.0-22.0) TSH <0.005 mIU/L (0.270-4.20) Thyroid Antibodies: Thyroid Receptor Antibody (TRabs) <0.3 IU/L NEGATIVE <1.8 Thyroid Stiumlating Immunoglobulin (TSI) <1 % NEGATIVE Thyroid Peroxidase Ab L <5 IU/mL (5-34) NEGATIVE Thyroglobulin Ab H 217 IU/mL (10-115) POSITIVE* Other tests: Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate: 4 mm/hr (1-10) Most Recent Thyroid Function Test: (27/5/15) FT4 HH 29.8 pmol/L (12.0-22.0) TSH LL 0.006 mIU/L (0.270-4.20) Other tests: Slightly lipaemic Ultrasound of Thyroid: Indication- Primary hyperthyroidism Right lobe of thyroid measures: 6 x 2 x 1.8 cm Left lobe of thyroid measures: 5.9 x 1.8 x 1.6cm Isthmus measures 0.5 cm Normal echotexture without nodules or calcification. Diffuse; mildly increased vascularity of thyroid gland noted. Cervical lymph nodes appear normal. IMPRESSION: Diffuse thyroiditis without focal mass. ABNORMAL working diagnosis: autoimmune thyroiditis current medications : 15mg carbimazole (reduce 10mg in 2 weeks time) 2.5mg amlodipine 10mg propanolol (2 times daily) So does anyone think they know what it could be? My doctor can't really say whether it's Hashimoto or something else. It definitely isnt graves. She said it could be Hashitoxicosis (initial hyper state; then hypo) I'm really afraid that one day I would suddenly be hypo . Oh; and is the size of my thyroid normal; what is the normal size for human? Thanks and much appreciated!,2015,2015,20,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,My doctor diagnosed me with anxiety/depression. The thing is; he diagnosed me with this condition after spending only less than 5 minutes in the exam room with me. My concern is that it may actually be my heart. (I recently started a hypertension medicine (amlodipine)). Most times I feel fine. But lately I've been having issues with running out of breath easily with activity (although I am 300lb; so I know that does have something to do with it); occasional chest pressure; and starting today my left arm feels very heavy. I also have been having a churning feeling in my stomach the past 2 days along with indigestion. Since I'm worrying so much about my possible heart problem; my anxiety gets worse. I have a return visit to the doctor on November 28th. It's a very busy office; so getting in sooner is basically out of the question. Any input and reassurance would be greatly appreciated!,2011,2011,23,Female

Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a copy of my treadmill test results. My ST was flat at about 0.9 out to about 90 BPM (V3); then dropped with a near constant slope to -0.9 at about 120 BPM and then dropped with a steeper slope to -3.8 at 142 BPM. The recovery line followed the test line to about 120 BPM and then recoved with a smaller slope to about -.1 at 80 BPM after 11 minutes of recovery time. I did not experience any angina during the test. The angiogram showed three blockages; two in one branch artery at 90 and 75% and the second in another branch artery at 75%. The two blockages are in a branch off of the LAD. The other is in a branch off of the RCA. The 90% block is right at the junction of the branch. I tried to paste a picture showing the locations of the blockages; but would not work. The doctor put me on Amlodipine besylate and Metroprolol. The cardiologist said that my condition is not life threatening as long as I manage my lifestyle.. Can I infer a safe exercise level from the treadmill test results? I am 6' and 196 #. Up to the day of the treadmill I was exercising on a daily basis on the elliptical and rowing machine for 30-45 mintes with my heartrate at 125 to 130 BPM to lose weight and stay in shape. I am coming back from 4 months of sedentary life recovering from a detached retinal requiring multiple procedures to fix. The cardiologist has said that we will reassess the need and benefit for a stent in about 3 weeks with another treadmill and nuclear. I have improved my diet; but can I really expect an improvement in the treadmill results with diet and drugs in one month? The doctor suggested that if I had continued to exercise at the higher BPM; it would have eventually led to a heart attack; suggesting a strong correlation between ST depression and death. If the blockages are addressed with stents; does that mean that mean that my ST depression will be mitigated? If so; does that mean that I can get back to a more rigorous exercise regimen? Thanks; Gary,2009,2009,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at? (upper 140's/70-80's) Thanks K :-) Have a wonderful day!!! Merry Christmas everyone,2003,2003,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7.

We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS? Could AS be the "Pain" that my son is having that we can't see?,2013,2013,29,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I am a male; 28 yrs old. I started medications for hypertension (amlodipine) and high cholesterol (crestor) in Dec 2013. After seven months on these I developed weird symptoms. I have been suffering from fogginess for the past 9 months. It's a fuzzy feeling in my brain and eyes. I also used to be very fatigued at times to a point where I could barely stand. Apart from this I have gastritis and heartburn though it has got better recently. I also suffered from unexpected weight loss. However currently my weight is more steady. I had all sorts of medical tests done on me. Only recently I was diagnosed with low vitamin D levels (less than 4.2) and low normal vitamin B12. I have stopped my medications for the past two months. However even though other symptoms seems to be getting better my fogginess has been lingering on. Has anybody else got similar experiences?,2015,2015,28,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor. Can anyone give me suggestions I'm to young and on to many pills and refuse to be disabled but it looks like that's not gonna be my choice if something doesn't change soon; thanks.,2016,2016,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I've had an unrelenting headache for the last 16 months. I've been to neurologists; pain management ; back and pain center; neurologists; and headache clinics.

Amlodipine+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?,2009,2010,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,My mother (56+ yrs) is under treatment for Hypothyroidism; Hypertension; Osteoporosis along with Osteo Arthritis. For Hypertension; she had taken Olsar 40 from Feb; 2014 to Dec; 2014; after which our medicine doctor has changed it to Olmat 20 AM; which she has been taking since past 3-months; during which most of her BP readings (using mercury device) are either 120/80 or 130/80. However; 2-3 days back; she started feeling the surrounding very hot & uncomfortable with complete loss of appetite & thirst. Also; she felt to have indigestion & a little fever (99.5); which got normalized after a day after taking medicines like crocin & pundinhara. However; during these 2-3 days whenever we measured her BP (using Omron electronic monitor) most of her readings are around 125/80 with pulse between 80-85; which is quite higher than her usual electronic BP readings 110/70 & pulse 70-75. Also; since the mercury BP readings are usually 10-15 units higher than that of electronic readings; I am worried whether these 125/80 readings correspond to mercury readings higher than 140/90; which means her BP is not really under control. Can you please help us with the below mentioned queries - 1) Do you feel her discomfort was related to indigestion problem or; could it be related to higher BP or heart issues ? 2) She usually takes her BP medicine (Olmat 20 AM) around 9:30 in the morning. Usually her morning BP (before medicine) is 5-10 units higher than evening BP. Is this normal or; sign of any heart problem ? 3) Do you see any need for BP medicine change or more investigations here ? 4) If she encounters similar problems in future; what is most advisable to do ? 5) Just to note: her FBS was 103 in Dec; 2014 & 92 in Feb; 2015 after certain dietary changes; although PPBS was normal (90). Is this slightly higher tendency of FBS related to her situation ? 6) Couple of weeks back she had fever with cold/cough (URTI); after which she was given antibiotic by our medicine doctor & asked to stop her calcium medicine (Shelcal CT) for 10-days. Could it be related to her BP increase since her BP medicine contains Amlodipine ?,2014,2015,,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello all; I have had the pain for about 8 years and docs have not been able to id. So; thought I might se if anyone has any other thoughts. I have pain when I stand; walk; seat or lay down (this is e order of level of pain as well - standing is the worse). When I stand the bottom of my feet will throb. Sometimes most of the bottom and sometimes I will get certain points like the heel or by the big toe that almost feels like a cigarette burn. Other time like when I seat from inside e ankle to my whole foot will burn/tingle. It's almost like the pressure on the back of my leg causes this. Also; sometimes if you run your hand from the top of my leg to the ankle you can feel;it go from warm to very cld at the ankle. This has been gradually getting worse over the past 8 years and I have seen a ton of doctors. General doc; nuralagist; chiro; podiatrist; homeopathy; acupuncture; pulmutalagist;. I have had MRI leg; ankle; back; X-ray; blood pressure test; nerve conduction test; lots of blood work with nothing being found. I have also trid lots of drugs neurotics; cymbalta; niacin; vitamins like the Bs and other. At is point not sure who else to talk to or what else to try; so any thoughts would be much appreciated:) Sorry I am an awful speller,2013,2013,,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's "Chest AP/sitting" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?,2009,2009,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a kidney stone (6.5 mm) removed via ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy on 11/18/05 because it became lodged at the ureto-vesicular junction after 12 days of excruciating right flank pain (6-8 hrs. per day) as it passed all the way down the right ureter. The day after the surgery; I experienced a different pain in the RUQ of the abdomen extending under and into the rib cage; back; and right shoulder area. I had a contrast helical(spiral) CT scan done on 11/21/05; and everything was normal except for sclerotic lesions found on my 4th and 7th left ribs (opposite side of the pain); which were believed to be bone islands by the radiologist. I had a bone scan done on 12/6/05; which showed two "hot spots" on my 10th left rib; which I later found out via a complete skeletal survey and a second reading of the CT scan (as they were not found on the initial read) to be two small sclerotic lesions on the 10th left rib (in addition to two small sclerotic lesions on the 7th left rib; one sclerotic lesion on the 4th left rib; and one sclerotic lesion on the right distal femur). The nuclear medicine physician's report simply stated that the findings were "suggestive of a benign process". I had an abdominal ultrasound done on 12/21/05; and the liver; pancreas; and gall bladder were seen as normal; except that a gallstone was found (without ductal dilatation; w/o widening of gall bladder walls; etc. and thus; was adjudged not to be a potential source of my RUQ adominbal/right rib cage pain). As shown below; lab tests were done before surgery (on 11/17/05); on 12/5/05; on 12/19/05; and; finally; on 1/10/06. The reason for the gap between the last two tests was to allow time for the liver enzymes to normalize; as multiple physical exams; CT scan; and abdominal ultrasound seemed to rule out liver; pancreatic; gall bladder; or kidney cancer; and the source of the elevated liver enzymes was hypothesized to be medicine (which was discontinued on 11/25/05). A colonoscopy was done on 11/28/05; and an upper endoscopy was done on 1/4/06; both of which were perfectly normal. Further; the cystoscopy done in conjunction with the ureteroscopy on 11/17/05 seemed to rule out bladder cancer. My PSA level is about 0.8 (ref. range 0-4); and thus; seems to rule out prostate cancer (along with a DRE done by my urologist). My main problem is that I am still experiencing no diminution of my RUQ abdominal/right rib cage/right upper shoulder pain (after almost 2 months); and my liver enzymes became significantly elevated between 11/17/05 and 12/19/05; although they seem to have come down significantly between 12/19/05 and 1/10/06; as seen below (AST down from 53 to 32 (ref. range 3-50 U/L) (ALT down from 209 to 77 (ref. range 3/60 U/L). My principal QUESTION is; in light of the above facts; and the below lab results; can I definitively rule out liver cancer? In this connection; would a liver tumor too small to be detected by CT scan and ultrasound cause the AST and ALT levels to rise significantly from well within normal limits the day before the surgery to well outside of normal limits (at least with respect to the ALT)about a month later (i.e.; from 11/17/05 to 12/19/05); with a significant rise between 11/17/05 and 12/05/05? Would a liver tumor cause the AST and ALT levels to rise as they did in a one month period; and then fall (although the ALT is still mildly elevated) in the next one month period; when they were perfectly normal just prior to the first one month period? Would a liver tumor cause pain before a rise were seen in the AST and ALT levels? Would a liver tumor cause pain without being detectable via ultrasound and helical CT scan? Based on my below lab results; can you provide any explanation as to what may have caused my abnormal LFTs? What recommendations do you have regarding further lab tests; imaging studies; etc.? (BTW: The medications I was given post-surgery were Cipro (2 tablets per day for 6 days; oxycodone 3 5 mg tablets per day for 7 days; and phenazopyridine (2 200mg tablets per day for 3 days). After a severe hypertensive episode on 12/5/05 (180/112 blood pressure); I was prescribed and have been taking ever since; Amlodipine (Norvasc) (1 5 mg tablet per day) and Ramipril (Altace) (1 2.5 mg capsule per day). A CT-Angiogram was also performed on 12/8/05 to rule out renovascular hypertension as the cause of my blood pressure. The findings were normal. Also; several blood and urine tests have been taken to rule out pheochromocytoma; multiple myeloma; and carcinoid tumors. All those tests were negative. 11/17/05: ALT: 32 (reference range 3-60 U/L) AST: 16 (reference range 3-50 U/L) (this was taken one day prior to ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy to remove impacted kidney stone) Alkaline Phosphatase: 82 (ref. range 20-125 U/L)LDH: 171 (100-250 U/L) GGT: 59 (ref. range 3-80 U/L)Cholesterol: 162 (ref. range <200 MG/DL) Triglycerides: 82 (ref. range <150 MG/DL) HDL Cholesterol: 50 (ref. range > 39 MG/DL) LDL Cholesterol: 96 (ref. range 0-100 MG/DL) VLDL Cholesterol: 16 (ref. range 8-40 MG/DL) (CBC; Sodium; Potassium; Chloride; and Iron all within normal ranges) 12/5/05: ALT: 104 (see ref. range above) AST: 36 (see ref. range above) 12/19/05: ALT: 209 (see ref. range above) AST: 53 (see ref. range above) Glucose: 104 (ref. range 65-99 MG/DL) Urea Nitrogen: 12 (ref. range 7-25 MG/DL) Creatinine: 1.1 (ref. range 0.5-1.6 MG/DL) Albumin: 4.8 (ref. range 3.5-4.9 G/DL) Bilirubin; Total: 0.5 (ref. range 0.2-1.5 MG/DL) Alkaline Phosphatase: 103 (ref. range 20-125 U/L) Globulin; Calculated: 2.6 (ref. range 2.2-4.2 G/DL)Iron; Potassium; Chloride; and Sodium: all within normal range 1/10/06: ALT: 77 (see ref. range above) AST: 32 (see ref. range above)CRP: 2 (ref. range <8 mg/L); ESR: 1 (ref. range 0-15 MM/HR) CK; Total: 184 (ref. range 0-200 IU/L)Urea Nitrogen: 12 (ref. range 7-25 MG/DL) Glucose: 102 (ref. range 65-99)Creatinine: 1.0 (ref. range 0.5-1.6 MG/DL) Bilirubin; Total: 0.9 (0.2-1.5 MG/DL)Alkaline Phosphatase: 88 (ref. range 20-125 U/L)LDH: 159 (ref. range 100-250 U/L) GGT: 64 (ref. range 3-80 U/L)Albumin: 4.7 (ref. range 3.5-4.9 G/DL) Globulin; Calculated: 2.6 (ref. range 2.2-4.2 G/DL) Cholesterol: 198 (ref. range <200 MG/DL) Triglycerides: 67(ref. range <150 MG/DL) HDL Cholesterol: 50 (ref. range > 39 MG/DL) LDL Cholesterol: 128 (ref. range 0-100 MG/DL) VLDL Cholesterol: 13 (ref. range 8-40 MG/DL) (CBC; Sodium; Potassium; Chloride; and Iron all within normal ranges),2006,2006,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello everyone! A quick review of what I know so far. I am a 33 year old obese white male; smoker; with hypertension. I was recently diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. I am on metoprolol; amlodipine and 81mg aspirin. I take simvastatin for my high sensitivity c-reactive protein number (8.9). I was recently given nitrostat for chest pain. This past week; I was put on a 48 hour holter monitor to see; as my cardiologist put it; why I had so many skipped beats. What follows is the narrative: "Monitoring started at 2:04 pm and continued for 47 hours 59 minutes. Average heart rate was 73 BPM. The minimum heart rate was 39 BPM at 3:38 AM. The maximum heart rate was 136 BPM occuring at 9:05 PM. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 3 beats; of which; 3 were in single PVCs. Ventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of less than one VE per hour. The patients rhythm included 12hr 34 min 34 sec of bradycardia. The slowest single episode of bradycardia occurred at 3:38:19 AM D1; lasting 3 min 53 sec; with minimum heart rate of 39 BPM. The patient's rhythm included 2 hr 10 min 43 sec of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia occurred at 9:04:02 PM D2 lasting 5 min 21 sec; with maximum heart rate of 136 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 1836 beats of which; 39 were in 5 runs; 12 were in atrial couplets; 1545 were single PACs; 7 were in bigeminy; 233 were in trigeminy. There were 2 dropped beats. The longest R-R interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest N-N interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest supraventricular run occurred at 9:49:35 PM D! consisting of 26 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 138 BPM. The fastest supraventricular run occurred at 1:24:33 AM D1; consisting of 3 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 169 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of 38.2 SVEs per hour TECH COMMENTS: Sinus rhythm with episodes of 2nd degree AV block; rates of 39 to 136 BPM. Rare PVCs without VT. Occasional PACs with 5 atrial runs; the longest was 26 beats and the fastest was 169 BPM. No pauses seen. Patient reported symptoms of palpitations and chest pain; which correlated with sinus rhythm. My cardiologist wants to run a sleep study. Obviously the 2nd degree AV block is of the greatest concern. The nurses told me it was of the type 2 variety. My question is that I had a sleep study done 4 years ago and it was negative for sleep apnea. Is a new sleep study warranted at this time?,2010,2012,33,Male

I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 60-year old woman; weigh 105 lbs; exercise regularly. I take meds for hypertension and cholesterol and I also take synthroid. About 6 months ago I started a low carb diet for my overall health because heart disease is in my family. I cut out processed foods; bread; white potatoes; pasta; crackers; candy; cereal; desserts. My diet consists of salads with reduced fat dressings; salmon; chicken; tuna; occasional steak; green vegetables; occasional sweet potato; nuts; cottage cheese; greek yogurt and Atkins bars. I recently had a blood test and my fasting blood sugar went from 87 to 96; and my A1C rose from 5.8 to 5.9. I was shocked because my diet has not included simple carbs for the past 6 months. Can you give me some insight as to what may be driving up my fasting gluclose and A1C if I'm not eating high carb foods? I do not cheat on my diet and I exercise 3-4 days per week. I would be happy to adjust my diet again; but I'm at a loss as to what can be causing this. Thank you.,2008,2012,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I every one nice to find this forum...I am a 60 year old male who has been very atheletic my whole life...From track and cross country to heavy weight lifting for 30 years.....At the age of 50 I started really getting tired all the time and had very little energy..so quit everything .....Have been talking to my doctors for 10 years telling everyone who would listen that it wasnt right to feel that way.......Any how about three months ago I had a reaction to nyquil that sent me to the hospital...All the symptoms were the same as a heart attack but all the test showed no heart attack no stroke and no nothing.....They put a great cardiologist on my case and it has been a wirl wind of doctors since .....Tons of test 3 trips to Mayo Clinic to meet the best ACHD doctor anywhere( in my opinion) They have found that I have a right coronary artery only.... My left coronary is missing and both my LAD and CX are both attached to opposite sides of the right coronary Have a few more test to go at Mayo in about a week to have a TEE they want to check the back of my heart...They have told me that as of now they dont feel they need to do any kind of surgery....I guess if I were to have a question it would be will I some day in the near future need surgery or can people live into there 80s and 90s with this if treated with meds ....,2011,2011,60,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,My husband has been recently diagnosed with stage 4 of 4 cirosis; he has Hep C; and I wanted to know what the percentage of people at this stage can go on and live a long happy life? He will begin medication on April 1st. I have been doing some research on the medication but I am still confused on the side effects and how it will effect him? I know it is not going to be easy for me and my two teenage boys but I believe that we can get through this if we stay strong for him. I am also worried about whether or not I should continue working. Please help me; any input you or anyone else can give will be of great appreciation.,2004,2004,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,My aunt is now switching from Viread (300mg) to Baraclude (0.5mg). She had been on Viread for about 2 years but her kidney functions have worsened. Our hepatologist and nephrologist think this is happening because of the nephrotoxicity of Viread; which affects some patients. In switching to Baraclude 0.5mg; she is supposed to take Baraclude every other day while still taking Viread everyday for 3 weeks. After that; she'll switch completely to Baraclude. No more Viread. Is this transitioning from Viread to Baraclude typical? On alternate days; she'll be taking full doses of both Viread and Baraclude. Is this not toixc? I understand that some people do combination therapy with the two drugs at full doses simultaneously. But it does surprise me that this is the way to do it.,2009,2012,47,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Is anyone taking metoprolol? It's driving me nuts! I do have anxiety disorder. And of course knowing they gave me this to lower my heart rate makes me nervous. And with my anxiety disorder I am taking my blood pressure every hour. I know that doesn't help. But dealing wit the metoprolol; it has dropped me to 88/55 at times; today 112/73; then 93/55 then 142/70. I get hot flashes; shakes; tingling arms; a general feeling of panic when I see my reading is low or I feel the shakes.... Could it be the drug? Does anyone else take this and have these symptoms?

Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I was on Prozac 20 years ago for a period of a year for post-natal anxiety disorder....it worked well for me then. I am now 45 years old & on blood pressure meds...I've had a very traumatic few years which resulted in post traumatic stress; panic attacks & claustraphobia. I bacame obsessed that this stress would all make my bp go up again. My doc prescribed xanax to take if & when I need; altho I only take if absolutely neccessary and has then prescribed Prozac for me as I was on it before with no bad side effects...HOWEVER this time it's giving me prickling skin which is very uncomfortable; nightmares; sweating; shaking; very dry mouth & bad tummy upset. I've tried to persevere like she recommended but the side effects aren't lifting....I'm worried that the anxiety of the side affects is actually going to make me worse & not better! I'm also worried that this added anxiety won't help my bp....however I do feel I really need a med that stays in my system long term rather than just a quick fix calmer which is also addictive....any advice would be welcome especially from anyone that may have had similar probs. Thanks!,2012,2012,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I have suffered from disabling migraines for over ten years and have recently been diagnosed with complicated migraine syndrome. My newest symptom is what feels like electric shocks throughout my body. Is that part of the complicated migraine syndrome?,2009,2009,47,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,I've experienced 3 episodes of tachycardia while sleeping in the last week. I feel a fluttery feeling in my chest with a "burst" of tachycardia causing my heart rate to peak at 140 BPM for approx 3-4 minutes. My doctor placed me on a 48 hr holter monitor (wasn't able to catch any of the episodes; of course) and the results were PVC's and sinus tachycardia which my doctor says are benign. She's ordered a stress test to cover all bases and told me that if the stress test is normal she wasn't going to worry about. By the way; I have suffered from panic disorder and lived med free up until Nov 99. I've been on 20 mgs of Paxil. I'm worried because when I experienced these 3 episodes I've had no anxiety or panic associated with it. Please give me a second opinion if possible. Thank you for your time. This is a wonderful site that is performing a great service for alot of people. Keep up the good work.,2000,2000,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; "Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis"; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record. Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,My poor girl Zola has been lethargic and disinterested in her kibble off and on this month. Two nights ago I bought a bag of a different food to see if she would try it. I mixed it with some old food and she ate the whole bowl right away. That was around 6 pm. I work grave shift so I got home Saturday morning and took her out to potty. Her eyes were both covered by the lower eyelid membrane and she seemed disoriented; and confused. I helped her find her way back inside and tried to calm her down as she was trembling. When I checked her gums they were very pale. I've never seen this; so I rushed her off to the vet. She perked up some (she loves car rides) but had an accident there.VET diagnosed her with renal failure... Creatine was supposed to be 1.8 and hers is 8.1. The BUN number was supposed to be under 29 and she's at a 90. I'm terrified. She has blood in herurine and the protein Is high. Vet gave her an IV catheter and sent her home with me to return in the morning. At pickup She was prescribed Hills Prescription Diet k/d and some aluminum hydroxide gel to take with it to keep her phosphorous levels down. She hates the syringe of the gel; but ate the canned Hills with vigor so that was promising! She spent last night curled up on the couch with us. She enjoyed her new food again this morning and her stool was a better consistency. At 9:00 AM today Zola returned to the vet for more IV fluids as planned. They re ran bloodwork and also checked her electrolyte levels to see where her numbers were. She stayed at the vet all day receiving fluids. She threw up once and had a little diarrhea there. Her numbers haven't improved. She will return tomorrow for another round of fluids and tests. I am so worried and not ready to make any decisions. I know the vet is doing everything they can. Does anyone have advice?,2016,2016,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,A recent paper studied the effect of most FDA approved drugs on the inhibition of NTCP; the now known entry receptor for HBV. Ezetimibe was found to have a 50%inhibition conc of 25micromolar; while irbesartan; a commonly used angiotensin inhibitor to reduce blood pressure; was found to inhibit at 11.9 micromolar. Both compounds have similar MW; but irbesartan is given at up to 300mg per day; while exetimibe is dosed at 10mg. Thus the combination of 30fold higher approved dose and the double micromolar inhibition potency makes; in theory; irbesartan 60 fold more potent to inhibit Hbv entry. Of course; binding of these drugs to plasma proteins could cause substsntial differences in the available concentration on the hepatocyte membrane receptor; and the pharmacokinetics could further influence the in vivo efficscy. Tests in chimeric mice are urgently needed to determine the in vivo efficacy of this common; mostly beneficial medication on HBV reinfection inhibition.,2011,2013,,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I am writing to you seeking for some practical advice; and I hope you can help me. I have outlined the problems as detailed as I can; and have included all drug (brand names in parenthesis); in case of cross-country differences. *** Hypertension; Tachycardia: I am now 22 years old; and 2 years ago; during a regular medical check-up; the gynaecologist found that I had a resting blood pressure of 140/90. Was a regular blood donor for 3 years (and on holiday); so the BP-spike was an anomaly. She subsequently refered me a to physician-neurologist. An ABPM was done; and the highest reading of BP was 158/128. Tachycardia was another feature on the ABPM (with HR as high as 160; not-under-strenous-activity). Note: No feeling of anxiousness during the high heart rate. I have very minimal family history of HTN (parents have slightly elevated bp; after age 45); am active; have a BMI of 21; and borderline Cholesterol. Have been through the mill for ALL tests to check for secondary HTN; and the only abnormality is high (sitting upright for half an hour) renin at 17.0 (Range: 0.2-2.8); although Aldosterone was normal. Doppler U/S and Renal MRA showed no Renal Artery Stenosis. Am now on Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg; Valsartan (Diovan) 160 mg; Propranolol (Inderal) 80 mg; all once daily. Doctors are ambivalent about diagnosis: Some belief it is essential HTN; while some belief we just havent hit the nail on the head. *** Tremors: A few months after that; I developed severe tremors of my hands; and when fatigued; of the legs as well; to the extent I cannot walk. I cannot write properly unless with medication (I am on Propranolol; 80 mg; once daily) as my hands will tremble and I have to grip my pen tightly in order to maintain penmanship; as my hands also feel weak (only confined to fine motor movement like writing; using a tweezer etc). My eyelids and lips also occasionally tremble (thyroid function normal). There are also occasions every day when individual appendages and digits twitch for no reason (kinda like a sudden jerk?). *** Problems emptying bladder: 3 months ago; I started having problems with my bladder; where I had to visit the bathroom a few times before I 'finished'. I also have problem initiating urine flow despite the bladder feeling heavy; and have perisistent dribbling at the end. The bladder problem became troublesome when I kept waking up at night. I initially thought I was having a urinary tract infection; but urinalysis showed no bacteria. Two pre+post-micturition Ultrasounds were done; the first showed incomplete emptying (bladder at that time was very full); while the second (a bladder which was quite empty) showed complete emptying. Note: Blood/Urine sugar consistently normal. I also realise that at the peak of my urinary activity (when I keep going to the toilet every half an hour); I have a lot of saliva pooling in my mouth; at the bottom (the rest of my mouth feels very dry); and I have to consciously remind myself to swallow. *** Haywire Blood Pressure; when ill: A month ago; I was admitted for an acute nasopharyngitis+otitis media+severe migraine. During hospitalisation; I was given Oxymethazoline Hydrochloride (Afrin) to clear the nasal congestion and IV-Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Early the next morning; my BP dropped to a surprising 70/40 (without anti-Hypertensives). I was not purging; or vomiting; and had maintained normal fluid intake. The BP stubbornly refused to climb despite the administration of IV-fluids; and I remained in hospital for 4 days. (Note: Doctor ordered me to off all anti-Hypertensives; and one week later; my BP went up to (the highest) 177/135)) *** Pupillary Reflex: Upon discharge; I collapsed at home; which the doctor diagnosed as vasovagal. Upon examination; she found that my pupils were strangely more dilated than normal (to penlight and accommodation); in absence of pain. I was refered to a Opthalmologist; who found no problems; using his "super torchlight" (he didn't use a penlgiht). The first doctor thinks there is still cause for concern; because my pupils used to constrict properly (to penlight and accommodation); and she has been my physician for the past 3 years. For a few years; I have had a problem focusing when I read (if for a long time) books/articles/passages etc wtih small print. I find that my central vision will suddenly disappear (peripheral vision is intact); and I have problems when reading from line to line (like the vision jumps). My prescription lens power has been checked yearly and they have remained at the same level. Is it possibly caused by accommodation problems? *** Differential Diagnosis: My physician has put a few things into the basket of possible differential diagnosis; and I am wiritng to you to ask if you have encountered anything even remotely similar to my case. Among the condition my physician suspects (subject to further discussion) are: 1) Idiopathic Pandysautonomia 2) Idiopathic Dysautonomia 3) (Purely Autonomic) CIDP My physician admits she isn't very familiar with these conditions as she has yet to see a full-blown case in practise. .. She suspects my immune system is always active. I have been 'plagued' with recurrent acute tonsilitis for years (leading to the eventual removal after going into a near-Quinsy emergency in 2006) and now without my tonsils I get other infections of the upper respiratory tract; have also had recurrent allergies which attack my eyes; ears; nose; skin since young. She thinks it is worthwhile doing an LP to check for oligoclonal bands. One note of interest: I had measles at the age of 9 months (to which the pediatrician said I did not need the MMR vaccination; since I had measles); mumps at 14 years old; and received my Rubella-vaccination at the age of (I think) 15. I read somewhere that the measles virus can remain dormant in the body for years and come back and wreck havoc years later. Is that true? *** Pressing Question: 1) Is there a reason for us to continue looking for an answer to my problems; and if yes; are we along the right path? I don't believe I am stressed out with life and neither does my physician or family; but is stress a possible factor in all the above symptoms? I am open to the possibility =) *** I know this letter is very long; and I thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you. Best wishes.,2006,2008,,Female

Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 25 years old and very healthy. I am not overweight; I work out regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke. For the past 3 months I have been having severe swelling in my left foot and ankle. At times the swelling continues into my calf and causes a discomfort. I first noticed the swelling after I got home from the gym one evening. I took my shoe off and my foot was huge for no reason. I have not had any injuries; insect bites or infections. The first doctor I went to took x-rays which came back normal and ran a CBC which also came back completely normal. He told me I would just have to live with the swelling and wrote a Rx for Lasik PRN to help. The Lasik does help when I take it but as soon as I stop taking it the swelling comes right back. I've been told not to take it long term as it can effect important vitamin levels. I wasn't ready to just treat the symptoms and live with it so I went to an Internist who took me off birth control pills thinking it could be hormones but the swelling continued. She then sent me for a venous doppler test which also came back normal. She is sending me for an untrasound of the heart tomorrow. If the heart tests come back normal what else could be causing this unexplained swelling? It is only in the left foot/ankle and pitts for about 30 seconds when pushed on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with a diasnosis? I am afraid that I'm at the end of the road with tests and the doctors can't seem to figure out what is causing this swelling in a young; healthy person. This discussion is related to Unexplained Swelling of Left Foot/Ankle.,2009,2009,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat? I am wating to see an electrophysiologist for an EP study to see what is going on. My hope is that this can be corrected quickly. I am taking metroporal and asprin daily. I am way too young for heart problems; and the stress is what is bothering me most! Can stress and anxiety cause Atrial Fibrillation??,2007,2007,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a scheduled ablation this Friday. I was diagnosed with SVT and I didn't even know I had it. I get a lot of palpitations and I am currently on 25mg of beta blocker x2 a day. I want to know if the ablation is worth it. Will it get rid of my palpitations? The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23). I think I had an SVT once and that was a year ago playing basketball; I came down from a shot and landed hard and my heart started beating fast and weird and I couldn't control it. The symptom went away in about 10 seconds. What does everyone think?,2009,2011,23,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying "well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this. I mean; I feel like i try to do everything right...I eat fairly well; I'm definitely not overweight; dont smoke or drink; somewhat active...the only thing I have trouble with is my anxiety. Ugh...this is frustrating!,2008,2008,,Female
Amlodipine+hypertension,For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches. My own doctor has; thus-far; not taken it very seriously and tends to take the line that; after years of 'getting away with it; maybe you've finally developed an allergy!',2007,2008,61,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,A week ago I had a Tia. I was unable to speak and could not move my left arm or leg. This went on for about an hour and 15 mins. After a night in the hospital; and an Mri and other scans. I was released. I was told I should have no side effects. But now I have bad head aches on my left temple and I get a stabbing pain on my temple and neck; that last that last just several seconds. Also my speach has been effected slightly. Often I will be talking and a word will pop in a sentence where it doesnt belong; and I forget just what I want to say. Could you tell me how long these symptons last? Thank you jjjtll,2007,2007,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the "spot" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?,2008,2008,,Male
Amlodipine+hypertension,Not sure where to post this. A few days ago I had a sensation of the floor vibrating under one foot. Since then I have realized it is my foot. It is felt in bloth feet; one at a time. Never both at the same time. I feel it when I am standing r walking. It is like an intermittent buzzing sensation. It comes in short bursts on after the other then stops. It will happen when walking and I will feel it with every third or fourth step. What could be the cause? I am taking no medications; only slightly over weight and am a 47 yr. old female in good health. This discussion is related to faint vibration or 'humming' sensation.,2007,2008,,
Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past 4 years I have been experiencing horrible symptoms. It seemed that the whole thing started as a sinus infection but then I went for a CT scan of sinuses and they were clear. I have been having symptoms of dizziness; head pain; shakiness and a spaced out kind of foggy feeling like i am watching my life from the outside - all day every day. There are some times for a couple of hours during the day that the symptoms may lift and give me a few moments to live- but not much. I have been to about 30 doctors- including ENT's allergists; neurologists; chiropracters; opthamologists. psychologists; dentists and everything else u can think of. All CT scans; MRI of brain and blood work keep coming back clean and ok. Nothing I try seems to work. There was a period of time about 3 and a half years ago that the symptoms lifted for about 4 months and then it returned full force. Some of the weird parts are that the shakiness seems to be seasonal - coming in spring and lasting thru summer and its miserable like a tingling pins and needles sensation thru out my body. I have also been getting what some doctors seem to diagnose as recurring sinus infections- like 10 a year- i take anti biotics and i feel slightly better until the next infection but i still have the other symtoms while I am on the medication. I have hay fever and allergies to mold dust...Every doctor tried diagnosing something different- like migraines or TMJ or some sort of other odd thing. I've tried tons of medications. I dont usually have all the symptoms at once...they kind of take turns. One doctor suggested moving to Arizona as it may be a sinus issue but the ENT's say I have no sinus isue- just regular allergies and the allergists say that they have never seen symptoms like these for allergies. I tried psychologists even though the ony reason I am stressed out is cuz I can never live....before this sickness I was the happiest person around- and even psychologists turned me away as normal. Is there anyone out there that may know something that can help me - please??......I can not go on like this anymore,2007,2007,,

Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a nine year old lab "Sandy Grace". She is in fourth stage renal failure-Of course she has seen her regular vet for fluids-ultra sound revealed she has one kidney which is failing. Creatine was 13-subs at home-now using hollistic and homepatic treatment. Recently more bad days than good. I am giving her ice chips which seem to work better for her than lapping. Pedialyte ice is also better. She throws up until she staggers and falls-I am continuously trying to hydrate her and giving her baby food-At times; she is able to keep it down; other times the vomiting is horrible. She continues to try for us; and we are fighting so hard for her-LIke others; I tuck her in at night (she sleeps on the loveseat with her "bankie" covering her). I am sleeping in the den with her so I can give her support throughout the night. Neither of us are getting much sleep. I have her spoiled now with hand feeding other than her baby food; and I hold her plate while she licks it up. I am using a recipe of egg yellow / whites; honey; and whole yogurt with a touch of dry powdered milk. This works sometimes. Sandy Grace is not ready to leave us-she continues to try-we try for her twenty-four hours a day. Is there any over the counter medication that I can give her that will help with her vomiting? We love her so much and she loves us so much-my husband and I feel like we will know when she is ready to go. We went to grocery store yesterday to buy more food supplies and liquids for her; when we got home; there she was looking out the window-barking for us to hurry and come inside-you open the door and there she is - -so excited; still wagging her tail for us. What can we do; this is our baby; she is so; so sweet-I know her days are numbered; but she is just not ready to leave. Help. Aggieone,2008,2008,51,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 73 year old male that has elevated BP in the pulmonary artery. Started out in early 2011 with a heart murmur; echo measured pressure was 38.4; repeat echo in about 6 months; pressure was 39. Recent echo last 2 weeks (2/6/13) was 40. I have no outward signs such as dizziness; SOB; fatigue. My peripheral BP runs about 125-135/55-70. My question is; I know the numbers are abnormal but how abnormal? Is a rise of 1.6mm of Hg in 2 years significant? How high of a number is considered severe. I have just been put on diltiazem CD 120 daily with a repeat echo in 6 months. Should I just wait and see what happens or should I be considering a more aggressive approach? I've read all the data on life expectancy and it's not good. My MD is a Board Certified Pulmonologist.,2013,2013,,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear. But im wondering now if it was from this pulmonary hypertention...???? All the articles im finding on PH says it is fatal and always progresses!!!,2015,2015,32,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,At my request; my family physician has agreed to change my medication from daily metoprolol extended release 100 mg to daily diltiazem 120 mg.

Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real "symptoms" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the "silent killer". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its "gentle". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now. Thanks for your time,2018,2018,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,Been taking Ramipril - Hypertension and furosemide - Water Tablet for 4 years and have had sessions of nausea and stomach upsets over this time. Can long term use have side effects and would it helped if I took the drugs at night?,2013,2014,63,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,In the last two weeks I have had four episodes of AFIB. The first in two years landed me in the Hospital. My meds were changed from Metoprolol to Diltiazem 360 mg per day and Fleconade 50 mg 2x per day plus Warfarin. The Metoprolol 25mcg 1 x daily has been making me wheeze for the past four years; but no one ever thought to change the meds. I have been on this new med protocol for 1.5 weeks. I just started the Fleconide and Warfarin three days ago. My question is I need to loose 45 pounds asap. I am doing very well eating 1000 Kcal per day with a small abount or carbs (under 25) and otherwise lots of green vegetables and fish (Salmon only once a week) ; then some extra lean turkey. Really feel great with the diet. But I started moderate exercise as soon as I was released from the Hospital. I walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.5mph then I do various lite weight lifting (Nautilus rocker equipment) I have lost 10 lbs since my Hospital visit. But i have also had three episodes of AFIB while the Diltiazem was being increased. EchoCardiogram and Chemical Stress test shows zero blockages or other heart problems. I have the approval of the Cardiologist to go back to the gym and moderately exercise. I have quickly become addicted to the exercise and the diet. I am afraid of the Fleconide; afraid of the AFIB and BP 130/86 avg. Pulse is down to 60 ( was 80 - 110) resting. So I am afraid of exercise. I just need advice. If I am on these meds will I be o.k. to exercise...?,2010,2010,55,Female

Diltiazem+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation.

Diltiazem+hypertension,Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report. Third echo since Nov 04; this at PHClinic; normal left 'side' at rest incl RV size and function. Est. RV S.Pressure; 32 mmHg (BP 158/90) inc. to 60 mmHg (BP 184/82)at peak exercise(supine bike). Ejection fraction response to stress from 65% at rest to 75% peak stress. LV end-systolic volume decr. with stress. There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'. Two weeks following my visit; new PHP prescribed Lisinopril 2.5mg AM; diltiazem 120mg PM. I track my blood pressure as advised; in the range of 145/80 pulse 75. I weigh 134lbs; 5'5"; don't smoke/drink; am 60. Exercise around the house and use stat. bike. Sometimes my BP reaches 180/95 for no reason. Worry so about all this. MBT,2005,2005,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and am taking Cartia XT 240mg for pulmonary hypertension; aspirin and Lovenox due to antiphospholipid antibodes; prilosec; and 30mg of Cortef daily for adrenal insufficiency; which is slightly higher than replacement dose to simultaneously treat my autoimmune disease. Also; prior to the pregnancy I was taking 200mg of plaquenil twice daily; as well as 1200mg of Ibuprofen; for undifferentiated connective tissue disease. I will likely have to restart plaquenil and ibuprofen after the pregnancy if my autoimmune disease flares; which is likely. I was wondering about taking this combination of medications while breastfeeding. The Lovenox will be dropped; but all of the others will continue. There seems to be conflicting data about the safely of taking calcium channel blockers while breastfeeding; in particular. Many sites warn against taking Cartia XT sustained release capsules while breastfeeding; based on the results of certain studies that show a substantial amount passes through to the breastmilk; yet some experts seem to think it's okay. What would you recommend to a patient like me. I really don't want to continue to continue to expose the baby to multiple medications; especially the diltiazem; if not necessary. Thank you!,2007,2008,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests. I wish I could have a monitor which could be activated to record an ECG when I have pain.,2007,2007,60,Female

Diltiazem+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65,Female

Diltiazem+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement. Does this seem reasonable?,2007,2012,65,Female

The cardiologist I currently see was unable to see me after the cath so had to be seen by the nurse practioner.I was told need to stay on current meds clonidine;diltiazem;traim/hctz;diovan metoprolol;minoxidil) The first cardio seen said that we were running out of options.I have tried every class of medication I'm max'd out on beta blockers;do to asthma;max'd on ARB's and Calcium channel blockers.I take a diuretic;told increasing that would probably help very little.I could not tolerate Ace inibitors and Central acting blockers;(Tenex and Catpres patch because of allergies)the clonidine tablets;I'm taking now have been causing me problems;but because I was told my option were running out; i continue to take them.I was told could take Hydralazine;or Aldomet;but both require taking 3-4 times daily.was told could go up on the minoxidil.i refused did not like the side effects. I've been checked for secondary causes;except Pheochromocytoma; told rare and not likley;should this be ruled out? I recently had surgery and had problems with blood pressure dropping to low(80/30)and breathing problems;shortness of breath when walking oxygen sat would drop to low;could this be from all the meds? I take numerous medication for asthma; could this be contributing to the increase in blood pressure;if so what can be done? Does Procardia work well for vasospasms. After reviewing the above and past post;if I were your patient what would you do? reccomondation please; was able to get appt with cardiologist. K :),2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 48 year old with a long standing history of GERDS;IBS; Ulcers and have had esophogitis; gastritis; gastroenteritis. I started having severe chest pain about a year ago and underwent a cardiac stress test; cardiac cath; in which the cardiologist feels that I have a nutcracker esophogus along with some leaking valves; hypertension. The stress showed some ischemia and hence the cardiac cath but that was normal. He prescribed nitro for the chest pain along with taking toprol xl; lotrel to control the htn; and he couldn't rule out coronary spasms all together but with my history of esophogitis; gerds;ulcers etc.. he feels that this is the best treatment. I also see a internist who recently did a EGD and found that I did not have Barrett's esophogus but some scarring and inflammation. I go through this every few months with the spasms; the intense reflux; abdominal pain etc.. I wind up off work for several days because I can't get it under control. How do I do this? I am tired of going through this every time I turn around. I have changed my eating habits; my sleep habits; also tried to decrease my stress level which is difficult since I work in critical care. Any suggestions on what else I can do?,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I appreciate any and all who can help me. Currently taking calcium channel blocker-diltiazem for tachycardia and high blood pressure; HBP not too high; but heart rate is. Does anyone know anything about carvedilol? How safe is it; what are the side effects? Has anyone heard of it being prescribed for tachycardia? HIgh blood pressure? I am sick of taking/switching medications; most of all I am sick of having tachycardia and believe my heart rate is just naturally higher than others' heart rates. They told me to stop the calcium channel blocker cold turkey and start the new medication; I thought I was suppossed to wean off of my current medication. What's going to happen if I don't wean off of it? This is driving me crazy!!!!!!!,2008,2008,,Female

Diltiazem+hypertension,My question is what does 'lung bases not well visualized' mean? In 2004 I was diagnosed with exercise-induced PH by a specialist in the field; and this was put down as being due to my high blood pressure being uncontrolled. My PAP at the time was 78. The next year I had another opinion with another very well-respected PH specialist; and he told me that he did not agree with the first diagnosis. I now see a cardiologist in the small town where I live; and my PAP at the latest echo was 31. I am 63; my medication is diltiazem; lisinopril; maxide and an aspirin. I don't and have never smoked. I exercise. But; I still have breathing problems and wonder if this is due to some of the medication; or whether there is some problem with my lungs. Thank you. MBT,2005,2007,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I recently had a right heart cath due to continuing symptoms of shortness of breath; chest pain on exertion; cold/tingly hands; swelling in ankles; fatigue (especially on stairs); "foggy" thinking episodes; pounding heartbeat at times. The results were a bit confusing to me and the doc didn't discuss much of it over the phone. All I have are a limited set of the test results as follows: PA Pressure - 88.9; Cardiac Output - 16.2; SBP - 150. When talking to him over the phone he mentioned that I had really high cardiac output and highly oxygenated blood in the lungs (meaning it shouldn't be that oxygenated yet). It's a couple weeks till I see him. Any thoughts on what could be going on? I've had these symptoms for several months now; am on Diltiazem and a Nitro patch but they seem to not be as effective as they initially were. My main complaint is the shortness of breath. It is a struggle at times to get a breath.,2008,2008,48,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 78 yr old female; colon cancer survivor; in good health as far as I know. I have hypertension that is under control with medication (HCTZ & Diltiazem) . I have swelling of my ankles (especilly the left one) which goes down during the night. My Dr. says it is venous insufficiency. I had a colon resection nine months ago due to stage 1 cancer and 22 lymph nodes were removed. Could this be lymphedema? Is there any treatment or medicine that might help other than the 3 "e's" (exercise; elevate; & elastic)?,2010,2010,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I have a question about ongoing irregular menstrual cycles and pain. For the last 5 or 6 months I've had very irregular cycles. Heavy bleeding with large clots where I'm flooding through into my clothes after 2hrs. This does not happen every period but with the majority of them. I also have recently had spotting several days of the month about a week after my "normal" period. I am in my 20's; not currently sexually active. I've had a recent pelvic exam; pap smear etc. They did not note any cysts on the ovaries during the exam but did say that they could not feel the uterus very well as it is ? retroverted? I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound for further diagnosis. I have three questions in relation to this? 1. What are the most likely causes of bleeding such as this? 2. Could medication which I take for hypertension and SVT/NSVT (propafenone; diltiazem and triazide) have any effect on menstrual cycles? 3. If this is a primarily hormonal problem is hypertension an absolute contraindication to taking oral contraceptives. Does it really increase the risk for adverse effects in an otherwise healthy; non-smoking young female? Thanks in advance for any answers you can provide.,2005,2005,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm being investigated for probable angina. Usually it is exercise-related; but yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and I had the same heaviness; radiating slightly to my jaw; but lasting for about half an hour; when I used GTN and it eased temporarily. My BP was 157/100 at the time. My GP said I should be concerned if it lasts over 10 minutes; but the stress was on-going. Do I need to worry?,2007,2007,60,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello again; I was evaluated for renal artery stenosis; it was ok. I'm hypothyroid; on thyroid medication since 92; lab work done and thyroid levels are fine. I don't drink; smoke; or do any kind of illegal drugs. All symptoms listed on previous post were conveyed to the cardiologist I'm seeing. Was on Prednisone off and on; while being weened off Labetalol.I had highblood pressure readings before starting any asthma medication. With all the prescibed medication I'm recieving. I'm afraid to take anything else. I was told I have essential Hypertension. With the information listed above; what else could be done? The beta blockers seem to work best on keeping the blood pressure down. However I'm told people with asthma should not take them. Q.How exactly do beta blockers cause problems for asthmatics? What is a similiar drug; that could be used in it's place? I feel like my concerns are not being addressed. Maybe I'm not asking enough questions or the right questions. Q. Any suggestions on question I might ask or how to approach him with my concerns. Could you please tell me how the following drugs work on reducing blood pressure? Clonidine; Metoprolol; Diovan; Tiazac; Trametrene; HCTZ; Minoxidil Thanks :> :> Have a wonderful day,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 72 year old female being seen at Stanford by a "heart failure" physician. Emergency visit with ATF and shortness of breath in Jan. Chest X-ray & EKG found enlarged heart; hypertension; ATF; injections to reduce hypertension and stabilize ATF; given diltiazem. Overall health is good; take nutricianal supplements consistantly. Take no medications; LDL too high; HDL 85 and triglycerides within range; risk ratio is about 3.5+/-. Stanford doc started me on carvedilol 12.5 2 x/day; lisinopril 5 mg 1/day and coumadin 5 mg 1 x/day; unable to tolerate lisinopril; switched to divan 160 1 x/day. Carvedilol increased to 25 mg 2 x/day. Ejection factor 30. I feel worse now than I did when I left the emergency and was placed on diltizem; heart rate is even higher (today 175/129 - pulse 50) similar in my local physician's office 2 days ago. I have worse symptoms since I started taking drugs. I have heart noises; am breathless; have fatigue; and feel the need for more oxygen. Stanford will do stress tests; etc. cardionversion in 3 mos. Not sure I want to continue taking these drugs (except coumadin) or go through that. If I had arrythmia for 50+ years; what is normal for me and how will jolts with "jewels" get me there. I am opposed to taking anymore medication - especially for cardioversion as they are so toxic. I wouldn't mind a second opinion about the drugs. Thanks; 1Jackie,2008,2008,72,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to "white coat syndrome"; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour. My cholesterol was 225; trigylycerides in normal range; with LDL of 159 & HDL of 49. I do not have a family history of any heart disease. I do not smoke & never have. I have one glass of red wine a day. Because my husband developed high BP & then A-fib; we have been eating a low fat; high fiber diet for over a year. I had rheumatic fever as a child; but doctors have not heard a heart murmur for years. Up until now I have been very healthy all of my adult life. I have a B.S. in medical technology. As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP. We have good insurance so can having any testing that is required; but I would prefer not to get into anything invasive until we have exhausted the non-invasive options.,2008,2008,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,Since the beginning of January I; have been intermittently tachycardic (HR 95-120; generally 2-3 times a day); hypertensive (running anywhere from 170/110-220/140); nauseated; flushing (dry flushing; lasting anywhere from several minutes to 24 hours; present on face; neck; chest; and arms); and intermittent low grade temperatures (99.0-100.5). Initially was thought to have influenza; but no swab done. Then ?bacterial infection; course of antibiotics with no improvement. Continuing symptoms with no change. Visited ER multiple times and received IV fluids; which did not improve tachycardia or hypertension as it generally does with dehydration. Sepsis workup was negative; CT scan chest negative as well as chest x-ray. CT abdomen/pelvis did reveal a focal lesion on the liver; and small nonspecific inguinal lymph nodes. Follow-up MRI finding was focal fat left hepatic lobe. Normal appearing adrenal glands and pancreas. Prior to January I never had any history of hypertension or flushing. Flashback to Feb 2010... I had a mediastinal mass resection that pathology came back as benign thymic tissue. Had experienced tachycardia 4 months prior to resection and was hospitalized; sinus tachycardia 130's and ended up on diltiazem drip (avoided beta blockers due to asthma history). No mass on CT at that time! Had not experienced any further tachycardia since that then. July 2010 left thyroid nodule discovered on US and FNA completed...indeterminate; too few cells. This was followed by 2 ultrasounds 6 months apart with no change. It was decided at that point that no further follow-up was needed. This was at Mayo… Back to present...Echocardiogram completed the end of January was normal. We did end up starting diltiazem CD 180 mg with absolutely no improvement in tachycardia or hypertension. Spironolactone initiated 50 mg twice daily; minimal improvement. Performed 24 hour urine for metanephrine/catecholamine...negative; I don't have the specific values from this. Also performed 5-HIAA at that time; which was negative. Phone consult with endocrinology by my primary MD came up with ?carcinoid. Chromagranin-A was negative as well as tryptase. Dexamethasone suppression test completed 3 times; slightly elevated (2.4; should be =0); Prolactin 1.3 (5.2-26.5); Calcitonin <5.0 (<8). May 2; I had surgery. When I woke up in recovery it was like someone flipped a switch. No nausea and no flushing at all!!!! Blood pressures and heart rate still elevated. Also had horrendous pain at the incision site that we could not get controlled. Once we got home; I continued to have really bad pain for a couple weeks (cheeks would flush with pain only; and stop once improved). Blood pressures and heart rate began venturing back down to 140/80-160/100 (not good; but definitely a major improvement from prior to surgery). Continued to not have any nausea or flushing. Pathology came back as benign adenoma. I continued to be the one in a million patient and ended up with an infection in my incision; an allergic reaction to mederma; and a myositis in the muscles on the RIGHT side of my neck…but still no flushing; nausea; tachycardia; etc. My body had every reason to have those symptoms; but didn’t! 3 weeks later all of my symptoms came back with a vengeance..blood pressures; heart rate; flushing; nausea; palpitations…EVERYTHING!! At that point; meds were the same dosages. Blood pressures much more resistant to medications this time. Have had to titrate meds up a lot. Diltiazem stopped; labetolol started (200 mg twice daily). Had to decrease it due to near syncopal episodes; but interestingly enough; I never had a low blood pressure even with spells. Currently on Labetolol 100 mg twice daily; Clonidine 0.2 mg three times daily; Spironolactone 25 mg twice daily; and Lasix 20 mg daily. Even with this regimen am very routinely running blood pressures 170/100-210/130! Heart rates finally 80-95. Other symptoms basically the same. TSH was 1.65 in Jan; 0.8 in June; and 1.77 last week (reference range 0.36-3.74); FT4 0.79 (0.76-1.46) and T3 130 (80-200) last week. So; here is where things sit as of today. My gut feeling is that this is thyroid; even though labs are normal and have been the entire time. It seems really strange that after surgery; for a full 3 weeks; all symptoms were improved. Then; at the 3-4 week mark when you can start to figure out if the remaining thyroid will take over full function; symptoms came back. We already know that there are cysts on the remaining right lobe. It is also interesting that I was nauseated and had no appetite prior to surgery and gradually lost some weight over 5 months. In the immediate 1 month post-op period; I lost 15 pounds without trying; and eating high calorie; high protein; small meals. I asked the surgeon if we should have removed the entire thyroid. He can see where I'm coming from and can see the reasoning behind it. He told me he can see a huge difference from before surgery; to after; and to now! Also is willing to take the other half out; but endocrinology is adamant that this will not help flushing and hypertension issues. They also can't explain why symptoms went away or why they came back…or what they were from in the first place. Next Wednesday I have a consult with the surgeon that trained my surgeon. If he has seen anything like this or can see my rationale; he will give the go ahead for surgery. I'm at my wits end and just want to feel better and have my life back. I feel like my surgeon is the only one pulling for me aside from my primary doc. My gut is that this has to be done to prove one way or another. I have sat down with my main endocrinologist and had a consult with another. In very clear terms I explained what I think is going on. I told them that they have to take a step back from their numbers and doctor hat. They have to be able to look at things from the patient perspective. Ultimately this is my body and that counts for something. I'm the one living this miserable; scary reality. The really frustrating thing is that my primary doc; who is wonderful; doesn't even know what to do for meds for BP anymore. He asks what endocrinology think; who in return; don't really seem to be concerned with the situation or finding a fix. I'm stuck in the middle and just want to feel better. I do have a cardiology consult in August; but truly think that if we take the other half of the thyroid out that we won't need it. Does my thinking make sense to anyone else? Any feedback would be truly appreciated! A million thanks in advance!,2014,2014,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I had originally posted a question and your response was for me to obtain the actual data and submit it. I did so a few days ago but haven't had a response. If you would be so kind as to review the data I received from the actual RH cath report I would greatly appreciate it. Any thoughts/interpretations would be very helpful as it is a long time till I can see the doc again for review.

Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 36 years old male; I have been in permanent atrial fibrillation now for about 3 years. I have had all the tests multiple times and there is no cause. I was finally able to se a good Cardiologist; He tells me that he will try to return my heart back to normal rhythm But he has told me that it is probably to late and that this should of been done a couple of years ago. He is going to try a drug effective in maintaining sinus rhythm; Electrical cardioversion and consider Ablation procedure but he has already told me that these procedures may not work because I have been in permanent atrial fibrillation to long. I am currently on Diltiazem 360mg ; Warfarin 5mg; and Clonazepam 1mg (when necessary). If nothing else works what’s next? I am at the Maximum dosage on my medications; and if Ablation is not an option; Is a pace maker my next option? Thank You Very Much Darcy,2005,2007,36,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times. I cannot take beta blockers and have lisinopril 10mg and dilitiazem 120mg daily.,2007,2007,60,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello; Please help;not sure what to do.One cardio feels I should do an angiogram; and possible be able to come off some of the meds;if ok.The other seems content on increasing medication and tells me I really don't need an angiogram.I take diltiazem 420mg; minoxidil5mg;clonidine.3;diovan 320mg;Tramtrene/HCTZ37/25; metoprolol 100mg;told to stop mevacor and Zocor do to severe muscle pain;test completed showed inflammation.As of 10/28 on no cholesterol meds.Cholesterol levels Tri-365 Tot-321 LDL-195 HDL 53 ratio 6.06.Stress Test images demonstrated reduced uptake of cardiolite within the anterior wall on the stress images;this anterior wall defect spared the LV apex but did involve the anterolateral segmemt.The rest images showed persistence of the mid anterior defect but some reversibility withen the anterolateral segment;planar images demonstrated a soft tissue attenuation artifact overlying anterior wall.echocardigram fine;MRA fine;Adensosine pharmacologic stress after meds injected felt like i was going to collapse;but just kept going;figured it had to do with meds.Family history father hypertension;high cholesterol;blockage in artery in neck.Mother hypertension;high cholesterol;diabetic;heart disease.I've had hypertension and high cholestorel since about 96 I did'nt want to take meds at that time.I'm having problems with palpatation told not a concern;chest discomfort told probably not related;tachycardia that seems to happen just before next dose of meds.no new nosebleeds some headaches don't smoke;however I lived a with smoker most of my life.

Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 30 year old restaurant owner who started having problems about 3 months ago. I started getting dizzy and short of breat at work. My hear would also race and I would feel like I'm about to pass out. My doctor refferred me to have an echo done. It showed moderate mitral valve and aortic valve regurgitation. I have been feeling signifigantly worse to the point that I haven't worked in a month. My cardiologist has tried covera hs 180; and 240 which didn't work and I am now on dilitziam 180 mg which has also not worked. I am in agony yet my cardiologist acts like I should learn to deal wit it. He doesn't seem to understand my symptoms are severe. Don't you think that he ought to be doing other tests??? I really need some relief from my symptoms!!!,2002,2002,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down on the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit. The only time I feel okay is when my sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated- exercise; emotion; etc. but when that wears off; I get unable to drive or walk around as my brain does not seem to get enough oxygen with the low heart rate from pvcs. Any thoughts much appreciated!,2012,2012,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I recently experienced an outbreak of (genital); herpes the third in about two months. I went to the doctor with the first outbreak and the MD said that it was an abcess. As I was told over 25 years ago that I had herpes; I did not take this any further; though the MD suggesting opening the abcess. This was my first visit to an MD in all these years. However; with this last episode; it seems that the herpes had spread inside my anus and was terribly painful; this along with general malaise; pain in my left groin and fever. It has taken about two weeks to recover. My question. I would like to know if there is believed to be any relationship between this form of herpes and pulmonary hypertension?,2005,2005,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at? (upper 140's/70-80's) Thanks K :-) Have a wonderful day!!! Merry Christmas everyone,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion. Thank you for your time; F.,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello everyone. please help. My doctors are a little slow in telling me what high blood medications I can take with visteris (the 3rd drug after interferon and ribovarin) and what bph (enlarged prostate) med i can take. my hep doctor insists I can't take rapaflow (bph) or amlodopine (high blood pressure). If you have had a similar experience or can help please respond. God bless you and my prayers for your recoveries.,2013,2013,64,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello everyone. Just happened to come across this site when searching for more information on PVCs and Mitral Valve Prolapse. Wanted to share my story as well. Thursday night after Thanksgiving dinner; I started noticed PVCs about every couple of minutes or so. I didn't think much of it since I'd just ate a big dinner and thought it might be indigestion. Then Friday rolls around; and still feeling the PVCs every few minutes. Saturday night I decided to visit the ER since I've never had this happen before. Usually I feel them a few times a day at most. The doctor ran some tests; did a chest xray; and hooked me up to an EKG. After about 8 hours; they said the xrays and heart enzyme tests looked fine and no stress seemed present for my heart. The PVCs were very clear on the EKG to them; so they recommended that I contact my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist for follow up. Naturally; I was freaked out completely; but I do take some comfort in reading the posts on this site and seeing that there are others like me that share similar symptoms of PVCs lasting all day (and far beyond). Since this is a new journey for me; are there any questions I should have ready for the cardiologist? Any tests I should ask for? Many thanks!,2009,2009,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,Had a ablation for wpw 10 days ago. EP said it is completely gone (normal EKG) few days after I had double heart rate that lasted about 2 min. Then went back to normal. Im tired and get out of breath sometimes.. Heart rate also goes up when walking goes back in the 70-80s resting. Im 62 and do take meds for high bloodpressure. Dr. Changed my blood pressure med. to cartia xt after I had a bad svt attack that put me in the hospital hoping that the meds would calm my heart down (on this med. I was feeling tired and out of breath at times . ) one this meds. I had another attack-dr. Sent me to see a EP he found the problem right away. There was a cancelation and the following week went in for the ablation. Like i said above everything went fine. Not due to go for follow up in a month; ive talked to his head nurse and she said that it was normal for the heart to act up after ablation; that it just takes time. But I was wondering if maybe the meds that im on is the reason that im tired and out of breath since that was going on before the ablation.? Im just not feeling great. Has anyone else felt this way. I know its only been 10 days but I work 40 hours a week and feel lousy all day!,2015,2015,61,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,35 yo M; previously in good health. Cholesterol OK (170s) and bp 120s/70s. My father and his mother developed high bp in late 50s. No other history of heart trouble. I've recently developed heart rhythm probs. For last 2 months; I've had episodes when my HR races upon mild exertion. 1st visit to cardiologist occurred the same day as I was having symptoms. The EKG in office was normal. But a stress test showed HR quickly at 200. The doctor diagnosed SVT/atrial flutter and put me on 50mg Troprol and 325mg aspirin. I've had progressively longer episodes during which HR might race. During these; my resting HR is 90s and upon mild exertion HR rises to 180s. Sitting down or just standing still causes the HR to fall back to resting rate. High HR lasts only for a short time. The alternative “mode” for heart is normal. The resting HR is 65-75. During extended moderate exertion; HR rises to 110s. Further visits to the cardiologist occurred during this mode and my EKGs were normal. I had catheter ablation last week. Doctor found three irregular rhythms:1 main & 2 extra. The rhythms switched irregularly between the three. The two extra rhythms were short-lived and came from the left atrium. Despite this; main rhythm was treated but other 2 were not (too short lived). Two days after procedure; heart switched over to the "fast" mode and it has been there since then. Doc wants to wait and see what happens. While this is somewhat unsatisfactory; I understand the need to get a better handle on how often my symptoms occur; their nature; whether medication might help. 1)Is the Toprol worthwhile? I don't feel it is making much difference. 2)My doctor described my condition as unusual for someone of my age. How unusual? 3)What are the major risks? Doc described my condition as not life-threatening and my biggest risk being an increased chance of stroke; but still very low. I'm a little paranoid about the risk of stroke now. 4)Is a second attempt at ablation worthwhile?,2007,2007,,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues. Thanks a lot; all the best; Leonel,2007,2008,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 33 Yr Lady diagnoised of Vasculitis(Small Vessel) at the age of 12 manifested as skin lesions. In the year 2002 I was admitted to hospital with hypertension & chest pain. A stress thalium was positive following which a coronory agiogram was negative. I was put on diltiazem tablets which I tolerated well and my symptoms reduced considerably. Few months back my BP dropped following which my diltazem dose was made half(90 SR mg once a day). I then developed chest pain & breathlessness on excersion which relieves on rest. My cardiaologist has now put me on an additional cardiac drug vastarel 35 mg twice a day. Its been two days since i started my new drug and today I had chest pain for a while which was relieved on rest. I would like to know if it would take a while for my new drug to take effect. Also can my problem be classified as microvascular angina whose cause could be vasculitis?,2009,2009,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,(This was also posted in expert forum last night.) I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down in the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit. The only time I feel okay is when my sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated- exercise; emotion; etc. but when that wears off; I get unable to drive or walk around as my brain does not seem to get enough oxygen with the low heart rate from pvcs. Any thoughts much appreciated!,2012,2012,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries "clamped down" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and "improper" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial. I had no insurance when I had the heart attack (husband was out of work and just got a new job) and there is a 9 month waiting period for anything pre-existing... My question is... since I have already had a heart attack from vasoconstriction am I more likely to have another from it?,2009,2012,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 53 yo man diagnosed ~8 years ago with lone paroxysmal atrial flutter and afib. Long term history of endurance sports but nothing outrageous - running 20 miles a week since my teens. Episodes are generally less than an hour; but frequent - typically one every day or couple of days. Have been trying a "pill in a pocket" appproach - that is; I will take some metoprolol (50 mg tablet) if the tachycardia lasts more than 5 minutes. Usually the episode will end 10-20 minutes after taking the medication. I have taken a Ca channel blocker (diltiazem) in the past; but that did not seem effective. So here's the question. The beta and calcium channel blockers as you of course know are referred to as "rate control" medications; yet they don't do a thing to my heart rate while I am in afib or flutter (though the beta blocker does reduce my resting heart rate when not in tachycardia; the Ca blocker not so much.) But the beta blocker does seem to reduce the length of the episodes compared to how long they last if I just let it go; so this seems to be some sort of rhythm control. (And again; the Ca blocker does not seem to be effective at this either; which is why it is a former medication.) Is my experience with these medications common in your experience - that is; some rhythm control but little effective rate control? Is there something about the metoprolol specifically that separates it from the other beta blockers? ("membrane stabilizing effect?") The reason is that metoprolol (tartate) makes my hair fall out and if there is another effective option in this category that will not make my hair fall out; I would like to try it.,2006,2014,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,HI; i'm a 20 year old female in college. I have recently (in the past year) been treated for SVT by having a cardiac ablation. However; my heart rhythm issues have continued. I have hypertension and general anxiety. I think the anxiety is more so linked to not knowing whats wrong with my heart. My heart rate is out of control. Resting it can go from 70-120. When I simply walk to class it will be about 140. My doctor has put me on 240 mg of diltiazem; which has solved neither my heart rate issue or blood pressure (still high). My EP told me that I have inappropriate sinus tacky cardia; and that I may just have it for the remainder of my life. My current worry is that when i'm at the gym my heart rate is generally around 175; but will rise to about 200. I get short of breath; so I stop. My doctor assures me that this is okay; but if I'm on medication to control the heart rate and its still that high; I don't understand how thats normal. I also sometimes feel palpations; but I had a heart monitor test and it didn't show any major abnormalities (I couldn't wear it when at the gym). I don't know what to do at this point. I'm at such a loss and feeling so out of control with my body. If anyone has any diagnosis suggestions I would sincerely appreciate it; or just to share your story. Thanks.,2016,2016,20,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 56 years old with a family history of heart disease; hypertension and diabetes. I have had high blood pressure; semi controlled; for 10 years. I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond. The extent of coverage of the pain is only pinpoint area on my chest and forearm. They appear and disappear right at the same time. There is no accompanying tachycardia; shortness of breath; or palpitation. Neither is it associated with heavy physical exertion. Have you had patients with this kind of chest and arm pain? What do you recommend for me to do?,2010,2010,55,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I talked with Gail a little while ago and she sounds good. She got out of the hospital last Wed. and for some unfathomable reason they still don't know what is wrong with her. She is on oxygen so she is kind of under house arrest until they figure it out. She had been waiting to get in to see this heart Dr where she lives; but he has not seemed in any big hurry so she has made an appt with either a heart specialist or heart clinic in Paducah for next Thurs. The Dr that referred her to the local heart guy told Gail that this heart guy thought of himself as semi retired and I am thinking he is semi retarded. She tried like crazy to get in touch with him and he still hasn't returned her calls. She has cancer for God's sake you don't put people off like that. I think her Dr said that the heart guy was reluctant to do surgeries because of this semi retirement and I didn't catch if that was pertaining to Gail or in general. I was on a cell phone and she is sucking oxygen so it was hard to hear and I didn't want to keep asking you to repeat yourself because you were starting to sound winded. Sorry; I won't talk about you like you are not here. Anyhow; they still think it is Pulmonary Hypertension and it can be treated with; of all things; Viagra. They think it is this PH thing because she is just fine on the oxygen (well; as fine as you can be hooked up to a tank) but 5 minutes without it and she is gasping for air. The Viagra makes sense; since it increases blood flow; but in her case it will be to the lungs. This is from the American Heart Association: The blood vessels that supply the lungs constrict and their walls thicken; so they can't carry as much blood. As in a kinked garden hose; pressure builds up and backs up. The heart works harder; trying to force the blood through. If the pressure is high enough; eventually the heart can't keep up; and less blood can circulate through the lungs to pick up oxygen. Patients then become tired; dizzy and short of breath. Here is the link if you would like to learn more. http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11076 She said she has been sleeping alot; but that is probably for the best anyway. Oh; another friend of hers on here called her Dr @ MD Anderson and told him what was going on (good for you; what a good friend) and her Dr got in touch with her local guy and they are changing her chemo; but I am sorry; I didn't hear what it was; but she won't have to go back on chemo until after her next trip to MD Anderson June 25th & 26th. That's all I know and I am sorry I couldn't hear better. We love you Gail and you just rest and get all better. Don't put up with anymore cr@p from those Drs up there. Love; Jan,2007,2008,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,My blood pressure has two different readings when taken from both arms simultaneously. The difference sometime can defer as much as 10 mmH. For example; from my right arm it reads 140/86; but my left arm reads 150/94 and it has been quite consistantly different between 5-10 mmH. Another question is; I am currently taking COSAAR 50mg to control my Blood pressure and after a couple of months; it seems that the medication has no effect on me. I was wondering whether the 100mg COSAAR is actually twice the 50mg dosage coz I am currently taking 1/2 tablet of 100mg instead of the 50mg tablet; due the cost different.,2009,2009,,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 43 years old; I have lived with abnormal arrthymia for a long time; over the past 12 years (since i had my last son; he is 12); they have gotten worse; about 3 months ago i went to a heart doctor and i wore a monitor for 2 weeks; while wearing it ; i got a call from the nurse telling me that they picked up something on the monitor and wanted me to come in; i asked her what was it and what time did it occur; she told me it was VT and the exact time this occured was the exact time that my alarm clock went off; i asked if being startled from the clock would cause it; she said NO but I asked the DR and he said being startled could cause it; but i do not understand if that is what caused it; and if so; then shoudl i still be worried? he gave me Toprol ER which i did take but after a few months i started having major dizzy spells; i called the DR and he changed the medicine to Diltiazem ER; I took 1 and felt totally horrible; still light headed and for some reason; spent the evening crying (which i never do)...any opinions?? could being startled be the cause?? after wearing the monitor for 2 weeks that was the only time it picked the VT up..,2011,2011,42,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 28 years old and otherwise a healthy individual. Last April I woke up one day with what I believe to have been atrial fibrillation; but by the time the EMT's arrived; I had converted. The doctor's at the hospital told me not to sweat it. I then had about two more episodes of atrial fibrillation after binge drinking the night before; but converted on my own. I did not think there was much of a problem until about a month and a half ago when I started to get PVC's every night. Then about a week after they began; I woke up with my heart wildly out of control. The EMT's came and hooked me up on a 12 lead and determined that I had a heart rate of about 280 bpm and that I was in atrial fibrillation along with Vtach and PVC's. I went to the hospital and stayed about 4 days. They thought maybe WPW; but my echo and stress test were negative for the delta wave or any other problems. I had an EP study performed; whereby my elecrophysiologist concluded atrial fibrillation. However; I think this conclusion was based on the notion that they were unable to reproduce my arrhythmia; so AFib was the default answer. I have been doing extensive research and thought my arrhythmias were related to GERD because I had noticed my PVC's were worse after acid reflux. It got to the point that every time I would lay down; I would have constant PVC's. On Thanksgiving I had bad heartburn; one alcoholic beverage; and atrial fibrillation the next morning. I had gone on a GERD friendly diet waiting to see the physician; and I magically felt a lot better. However; a few days later I started having PVC's at night again; but this time it was not when I laid down; but rather after I had slept for awhile. I had a barium swallow; which came back negative for GERD; but positive for duodenitis. Feeling lost as to my problem; I came across information about vagally mediated atrial fibrillation; which seemed to make the most sense. I believe my duodenitis to be caused by an over-secretion of stomach acid due to the vagus nerve; which is why the test was negative as to GERD. I am also male; young; otherwise healthy heart; former military and athlete. I now have PVC's; which occur after about every 5-7 hours of sleep. I can I get up for a few hours and then go back to bed (assuming my vagal tone is not so high) and I can sleep without palpitations. I feel my heart rate is not as consistent anymore as it used to be. My resting rate is about 75-85 bpm; but goes up to about 120 or 130 when I stand up and walk around. So my questions are: (1) does this sound like vagally mediated atrial fibrillation and PVC's? (2) is an ablation a viable option for vagally mediated atrial fibrillation? (3) are there any tests that can be performed to check the function of the vagus nerve? (4) Should I also see a neurologist; and if so are there any subspecialties to look for that focus on the vagus nerve? I should note that I am seeing my electrophysiologist this week; and I am scheduled to see a gastroenterologist sometime soon. I am on diltiazem; but I only take as needed to convert out of AFib. However; I have taken the dilitiazem hoping it would help with the PVC's; but it did not seem to make a difference; and maybe even made them worse.,2010,2010,27,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Two SVT related questions: 1) I've only experienced SVT one time a few weeks ago. What are the risks for not taking anything to prevent a recurrence? Wouldn't it be OK to not take anything? Isn't it likely that I won't have a recurring episode for a long time? 2) Are there any alternatives to regular blood pressure medication for treating SVT? I was taking metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily; but this caused me to experience chest pressure. My cardiologist took me off of it and put me on a low dose of cardizem. I haven't experienced any ill effects so far from cardizem; but I would much rather find a natural treatment for SVT like acupuncture or natural medicines. I know that bearing down can help stop an episode of it... what else can be done naturally? Thanks. I can't believe I'll have to take something for SVT for my whole life...and I'd like more information.,2009,2009,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I was diagnosed with mild left ventricular hypertrophy due probably to hypertension and told to treat the hypertension and not to worry. I had this condition for at least two years before I knew about it. It was called to my attention by an echo report in my records while attending a new physician. I have had some very rare pvcs and pacs showing up since my twenties. Suddenly lots of pacs showed up on a monitor in 2002 along with a regular two a minute about that time. There were thousands of pacs. This alarmed me ; but I was told they were benign. They seemed to go away for several years. Then in 2006- 2007 I began to have night attacks of high blood pressure and rapid pulse up to 120-150bpm at times; These were about every 3 -5 months; sometimes more and would sometimes send me to the E.R.. These attacks are very scary when waking up out of sleep usually 1:30 or 3:00 A.M. No one could decide why. Theory was anxiety attacks; or med not holding twenty four hours. I take hyzaar 50/12.5 and taztia for diltiazem 120 extended release q day. Then in February of this year I awoke in a -fibrillation went to the E.R. by ambulance and was kept at the hospital overnight. I converted into a regular rhythm with use of lanoxin and digoxin and heparin by 4:00 the next afternoon. I had just seen a cardiologist the Monday before for these recurrent night episodes and was told that I did not even need a cardiologist until this suprised even him. I saw him again the Monday after the a-fib. He said that he would just watch me and not even change any meds right now. I'm 59 and was in really good health before . This lvh disgnosis and the a-fib attack have really scared me. Can you please tell me anything about this to help my confidence or to just help me to be more informed? What more can I do? How dangerous is this? I work with children every day and have been afraid to keep my own grands overnight? lanakaye,2007,2007,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,In october of last year; I went to the hospital with chest pains. My bp was 195/110. they gave me three nitro glycerin tablets before it came down. The blood test revealed no negative enzymes. That was a sat. night and I was admitted to the hospital and put on a nitro patch. 5 AM monday morning; the ekg showed that I had "flipped my t-waves." Up to that point the ekg hadn't changed. Tues. morning I was transferred to another hospital for a heart cath. That revealed no damage but the doctor said that part of my heart was not beating with the rest. I believe it was the anterior apical. The diagnosis based on the above info was that I had a coronary artery spasm. that there was some damage to my heart but they felt it was reverseable. I was told I have prinzmetal's angina also. I went to cardiac rehab for 3 months and was working out 4 days a weeks at the gym after I finished the rehab. A few weeks ago; I went to SLC; Utah. On both planes on the way out I had chest pains and took my nitro. The next day I had chest pains 2 more times. The hotel called the paramedics and I was taken to the er. My bp was again 190/110. I had chest pains again in the hospital and they gave me nitro and it finally came down and stayed down. After 6 hours they released me. The cardio- logist at the er in Utah said he thought I got cehst pains because of the high bp and that he wasn't convinced it was angina or that I had a CAS in October. I was dizzy off and on for the week that I was there but I thought this was due to the altitude (I live at sea level and SLC is 4500 ft.) When I returned home I was still dizzy. Went to my cardiologist and my bp was 200/100. He put me on diovan and sent me for a renal scan with flow (nuclear). the results of the renal scan were R>L 55>45. that was a couple of weeks ago. the diovan is keeping my bp around 110/70. the cario. wanted me to go to our local community hospital and have a renal angiogram and possible angioplasty. This hasn't been done at this hospital before and I don't think I want to be the first. My primary physician is sending me to another cardiologist at Temple University in Phila. for a second opinion. I see him on the 22nd of this month. This is where I get confused. Why a second cardiologist? Should I be seeing a different kind of specialist? Sorry I forgot to mention that I am 48 year old female. My father had a heart attack at 54 and he had high blood pressure although he was an acute alcoholic so I assumed the bp was from the alcohol. I don't drink (haven't in 19 years); stopped smoking 3 years ago. Smoked from 18 to 26; didn't smoke from 26 to 36; smoked from 36 to 45. I take cardizem cd 300mg; lipitor 10mg; premarin 1.25 and one aspirin daily. And now diovan 80 mg. From what I have read 55>45 doesn't sound definitive for blockage but I was told that normally the left kidney has greater flow then the right. I am wondering IF my renal artery is partially blocked; could this have been the reason for the cardiac event in October? Could it have been that my bp going so high caused damage to my heart? It was more then 2 hours before I went to the hospital and my bp was high at the hospital for a while before they finally got it down. Thank you for your time diane,1998,1998,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Ever since I was diagnosed with what was thought to be a MI; I have been seeking the answer to what happened. I have had a DR. here on Cleveland Clinic say from the sTress tEst I was given and the symptoms that it sounded like I did indeed have a MI; allthough a mild one probably. Also the Stress tests indicated that I may have had one and some area of damage; or what is called Stunned Myocardium. The first cardioloigst I went to did a Catherization which showed no blockages and then a Echocardiogram. I saw him today and haven't got the actuall report yet; but he told me from the symptoms I have that he now thinks what I have is Vaso spasms of the heart; or atypical angina. He talked about calcium channel blockers and using the nitro I am already taking. He based this on the symptoms and the fact that taking the nitro helped with chest symptoms after taking Nitro. The question started when I asked about Ischemia and parts of the heart not getting enough blood; / oxygen; and if you don't have blocked arteries; if you could still have symptoms if you are not getting enough blood. He said yes; then I asked about if there was any connection between Raynaulds disease and Ischemic Disease of the heart. I dont think he gave me a direct answer; but this question gave him some intersest; and when he found out I have suffered from Raynaulds since the 1980's; he seemed to be putting two and two together. The other thing I thought was interesting; was than this initial attack was very strong; and that I had several clusters of them close together from begginning of April till the end of May. I have not had a Angina attack for about 3 weeks. My attacks came with no exertion or exercise; no foods or undue stress. The fact is that I have been MORE STRESSED SINCE THE INITIAL ATTACK; BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND THE CAUSE OR DEFINITE DIAGNOSIS. So it was not anxiety; panic disorder; GERD; or anything similiar. I have severeal EKGS that mention possible Mycardial Ischmic disease. How is that diagnosed or can it be diagnosed? Has anyone else had a connection between Raynaulds Disease and this Coronary Vasospasms of the heart? I have read different things on the Web about Pretmetals Angina; is this the same thing? How often do these attacks come and go or how do you know when you will get an attack? One thing I read talked about doing the same thing you do for Heart disease; such as lowering the prevention like high blood pressure and high cholesteral; and smoking. I take meds for high blood pressure and cholesteral; and I quit smoking 30 years ago. What other things can I do to keep this under controll? I am still wondering why the dr on Cleveland Clinic had the ( apparently ) wrong diagnosis from the stress test? Thanks to everyone who helped me in trying to figure out what is going on.NOw I just need to see my Regular Dr. to see what is done next. Fluffypurrcat,2007,2008,54,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

I have been to MGH for a brief appointment and they suggested that they do surgery when the tumor grows over 1 cm. This is due to the fact that in their experience; the tumors continue to grow once over 1 cm. At the time of my appointment last year; my adenoma measured 8mm x 5mm x 7mm. They thought it would probably never grow. However; a recent MRI showed that it has slight enlargement at 8mm x 9mm x 7mm. I have adrenal insufficiency secondary to ACTH insufficiency but no other hormones are deficient yet. The tumor is located along the right cavernous sinus but doesn't invade the cavernous sinus yet. I have a few questions about this. 1. When does the Cleveland Clinic operate on nonfunction pituitary microadenomas? 2. Do you ever see ACTH as being the only affected stimulating hormone or the first deficient stimulating hormone? Also; I have some T2 hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the brain consistent with microvascular changes. I'm only 39 and have some kind of autoimmune process with anticardiolipin antibodies. Could this be the cause? Should I be evaluated for something else? The pattern of the T2 hyperintensities is not consistent with MS. Could it be caused by Lyme? Will they progress? Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky. Being so close to start with means anytime I don't drink enough; get a fever; have diarrhea; sweat too much in the summer heat... then I totally bottom out my bp. At what kind of pressure do other people feel symptomatic?,2008,2009,41,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with pvcs and take lopressor for them. Ive also been put on Lexapro for the aniety. The problem is I have more than just PVC's and they seem to be worse after eating for about 4 hours. They are progressivly getting worse and the rhythem is completly out of control. It beats then has 4 or 5 fast beats then a pounding beat and then is starts again with maybe 4 beats and then one hard one regular. I mean it's just crazy. Everytime I go to the Cardioligist; he tells me Im fine. Yet the irrgularities are getting worse. I've had holters but not since I started having all these weird ones. But it's always after I eat. Please help me. I need some piece of mind. I feel like Im going to die. Tlaneh,2006,2006,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night. How worried should I be?,2009,2009,29,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think? Thanks; Renne,2011,2011,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I had a CT Angiogram of the Chest it showed an "ectasia of the ascending aorta; which measures 3.1 cm in AP dimension" Should I worry about this? Is it something my cardio doctor should monitor? Just don't know what it is and all the ER docs said was that the CT was negative. Thank you;,2008,2012,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 25 year old caucasian male of irish descent. Ever since being physically active as a child; I have had problems with muscle cramping. Strenuous and semi stressful physical exertion would often be accompanied by extreme painful muscle cramping in major leg and arm muscles. Making it difficult to move; let alone lift a particular arm or leg. Growing up I had a normal childhood riding bikes; playing baseball; tag; all the sorts of things young kids do. Often times the cramping would never present itself. Appears to almost be random. In highschool I ran cross country (not very well; however; often finished last in races due to extreme muscle cramping/pain; but I always finished a race; running through the pain. Went on to do some track and also some tennis; along with some bowling. Have experienced this extreme cramping/pain in all of these sports at one time or another. In college I did competitive fencing for two years. For the first year or so; it seemd that I was no longer presenting the symptoms described. However; a year into it I had a very stressful match and ended cramping across my entire body; not being able to move. Again; had to fight through the pain. Along with the painful cramping; another symptom has consistently presented itself. My muscles; in random places on the body; sometimes twitch or spasm. The spasms rarely last for more than 1 or 2 seconds; and seem to be random occurences. They sometimes will happen in the same area randomly for up to 10-15 minutes. It is very; very inconsistent. I also randomly somtimes experience medium to severe chest pain at random moments in time; often not accompanied with any cramping; muscle spasms; or physical activity. It can happen anywhere. Sitting down at the computer. Driving. Doing physical activity. Not doing physical activity. I had tests done at the Cleveland Clinic and they were not able to diagnose the issue. I had raised CPK and CK levels in unnaceptable leves in the thousands. However; no other enzyme or blood levels were out of whack. I had three muscle biopsies. One in my right upper thigh muscle; and one on each forearm. Tests were negative for any kinds of myopathies. Tests were negative for any severe neurological diseases like MS; MLS or any other sort of degenerative muscle disorders. Acid reflux has been toted as a likely candidate for the chest pains. Prevacid and Prilosec have both reduced chest pains slightly. However; the medium to severe chest pains have presented themselves at times when acid reflux could not possibly have been the culprit. I recently had a colonoscopy performed due to my family having a history of colon cancer. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. There was a worry that I might have inherited Crohns from my mothers side of the family; but that was not the case. I also did not appear to have IBS or anything of the sort. The only other thing I can tell you is that I have been told I have a condition called malignant hypothermia. A disorder that all anesthesialogists must be aware of prior to giving me any form of anesthesia. The Cleveland Clinic did a number of tests on me; including blood draws; muscle biopsies; ekg; though; I don't quite remember of an MRI or CT was performed. This was done when I was 19 years old. I have not had any further look into this since then; and I'm wondering what my next steps should be. Besides the unexplained muscle cramps/spasms and chest pains; I am a very healthy 25 year old male. I'm perhaps 10-15 pounds overweight; but then again who isnt. I have seasonal allergies to ragweed; pollen; mold; dust; all those. I have however never gotten an allergy ***** test. However; I'm not allergic to any of the major things like penicillin; peanuts or latex. I typically get a strep throat infection almost perhaps like clockwork every spring and fall. I don't have any sexually transmitted infections; I have never done any intravenous drugs. I've occasionally smoked marijuana and i have ingested psylocibin mushrooms one time in my entire life. I have also never broken a bone in my entire body. Mentally I have had issues with both depression and anxiety; often brought on; especially as a child; by these bizarre cramping events. Imagine having a ton of fun with other kids; only to be made fun of because I couldn't play anymore due to extreme muscle pain/soreness; being told by gym teachers and sports coaches to suck it up and quit complaining; or being called lazy because I simply could not continue with a certain physical activity due to extreme cramping and muscle pain. Also; I was told by one of the doctors that I should avoid massive amounts of caffiene. Is there any truth to this? If so; how much caffiene is bad; and should I avoid drinking anything that contains caffiene such as soda; coffee or energy drinks. On a side note; when I watch the show House M.D. I wish there were a doctor smart enough to diagnose whatever the hell it is that I have. Isn't fiction television grand :p My main concern is this. What is wrong with me; and can it be potentially life threatening?,2008,2008,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Want to tap into the collective experience of those who are on; or who have been on blood pressure medications. What have you tried? What dose? What was your blood pressure before and after? What side effects from the meds? How long did you stay on them? Etc; Etc.

Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm on a small dose of bisoprolol; 2.5 mg's. To be honest it doesn't help the pvc's. Is there a specific beta blocker that deals directly with supressing these pvc's. I've been on toprol as well with no positive results.,2004,2004,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been constipated the last couple of weeks. I took some Senokot last Tuesday to help with this. Then on Wednesday I had a bowel movement. It was really hard to pass the stools. I noticed there was blood on my stools and on the toilet paper. I went to a doctor the same day and was told it was an anal fissure. The doctor gave me hydrocortisone suppositories. I took these for a couple of days; but had to stop using them because it was too painful to use them. Also; that same day I drank some prune juice. This caused me to have diarrhea; which worsened the pain. Ever since Wednesday I have been in so much pain I have not been able to sit up; therefore have not been able to work. I have to lay on my side; I cannot even ride in a car. The pain is constant; not just when having a bowel movement. I have increased my fiber intake and fluid intake and now I'm having 1-2 soft bowel movements per day. I have been taking 3-4 tub baths in plain warm water a day. I have tried using hydrocortisone cream and anesthetic cream. None of this seems to be helping. I also noticed something strange when I was applying the cream. It looks like there is something hanging from my anus. I can't tell if it is skin or a hemorrhoid; but the doctor did not mention it. I also feel constant pressure there; like something is pushing down on me. I haven't noticed anymore blood in my stool. And yesterday I started to have itching and burning (like I'm on fire) there also. I'm not sure what to do. How long do fissures take to heal? How long do they take to stop causing so much pain? I can't miss anymore work from this; but I can't even sit up. I'm typing this standing. Could I have something else going on with me besides a fissure? Thanks.,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Here's something that might buy some valuable time and help in a blood pressure spike. I had them for years and then not. Recently the last two or three days - I had bp go to 169/85 and I'm currently trying to figure out what caused that. I got up and had two cokes and 2 cups of coffee and we had breakfast (bought at cracker barrel restaurant) Most of the day both times it was in the 111/64 to 135/70 range - then suddenly shot up late in the day and reached over 150/75. I took extra medicationa and it didn't come down. So I'm going to tell you of a method to bring down a spike - unless caused by some secondary reason such as organ failure. its' not pleasant but it sure beats a stroke or heart attack. This is the use of prune juice to clean your sytem. I drink 32 ounces as fast as I can and I stay near the bathroom (obviously ) After passing a lot of fluid out - the pressure in the arteries goes down as fluids equalize thoughout the body. I used to be on the Bloodpressureline - where endocrinologist and hard to control hypertension specialist Dr. Clarence Grim was and when told of the prune juice method he said "maybe we should have some clinical trials of that) He may have been joking but it works. If you drink the prune juice within an hour you will be dropping fluids in 1.5 hours and for me and most people the blood pressure will drop fast. I would stay near the bathroom. I don't personally like prune juice but we keep it on hand all the time and I used it today and yesterday and it got my bp down into thw 120/65 range and it will go lower tonight. After this all my meds work better as my bp stays down as long as I don't eat salt or what I'm suspicious of - Coffee - I take cardizem (diltiazem) and lasix. One guy on the blood pressure forum tried it and said "I got a very nice reduction in blood pressure - but then I went and replenished the fluid that was lost and the bp came back up." He didn't understand that most people - especially those overweight carry way too much fluid in their bodies and you take some out and you dont restore it. So if you are thinking you might be going to have a stroke or heart attack because of high blood pressure - give it a try and you should see a reduction in bp within a couple of hours. We have had times when me taking more medication did not bring the blood pressure down and the Prune Juice was the only thing that worked. My wife also has high blood pressure and was going to use "pruny" we call it but she hates it too. She was able to cut back on her fluid intake and her bp went down. We think it is salt and in fact when we keep the salt intake down bp stays down too - that and I love my coffee and sometimes drink too much. Any questions you may have - direct them to ***@**** This discussion is related to high blood pressure spikes.,2007,2008,,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Posted By CCF Cardio MD-SGM on December 16; 1997 at 20:21:56: In Reply to: Coronary Artery Spasm posted by Carol on December 04; 1997 at 15:57:20: : I am a 48 year old woman; 3 1/2 years ago I had a heart attack with no previous angina. I was kept in our local hospital on heparin etc. for 3 weeks until I was transported to the Heart Institute. The next morning I had an angigram and immediate bypass surgery. The LAD was 99.9% blocked. Over the last 3 years I have been having angina at rest-never after exercise. I have just had another angigram and have been told there are no blockages but that an artery went into spasm will the angiogram was being done. I am now on cardizem 240mg. and nitro patch 0.8 for 14 hrs. per day. I have been trying to find information on Coronary Artery Spasm but all I can find is a line here or there.

Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 44 year old registered nurse; who for the last 8 months have had right upper quadrant pain; sometimes radiating round to the back and bouts of heavy nausea. Previously in May I was diagnosed with tiny scattered ulcers from the stomach through to the small intestine; this was thought to be related to the anti-imflammatory's I had been taking for acute back pain previously experience in mid Feb to mid March. This problem is cuurently resolved. However; the ruqp and nausea has continued and after a trip to A&E who ruled out a perforated ulcer after bloods and x-rays were taken; and an admittance due to dehydration and pain mx my specialist just monitored my symptoms and treated with Motilium and analgesia. I continued to experience actue episodes of ruqp and nausea and called my gastroenterologist to help me. He arrange for me to be admitted for tests and after an Endoscopic U/S sludge was discovered in the Gall Bladder; and it was decided to remove the GB immediately. The surgeon was certain the sludge in the GB was due to 20 KGs I had loss from dieting from Feb 09 to June 09. After post -op pain had subsided I still had bouts of nausea and occasional ruqp. I visited the specialist before I took a 5 week holiday in the UK. It was decided I would continue to take the Motilium and analgesia as required. My first night I was gripped with horrendous abdominal pain totally different to before more mid-upper and under rib pain which took my breath away to descibe would say these were more like a spasm pains. I had 3 waves of these pains which all lasted about 2 minutes each and left me feeling very nauseous. Over the next 4 5 weeks the nausea came in waves and pain was intermittant. Then in Mid-October these spasm pains returned with a vengence. The next day my specialist mentioned a dysfunction called 'Sphincter of Oddi'; bloods taken were negative and he just gave me alternative options to control these spasms and nausea. Tiny mini-like-spasms felt leading up to xmas were manageable; then xmas morning the spasm came out of the blue; unbale to take the Buscopan until pain subsided I was unable to eat/drink anything all day; eating around 18.00 that evening; the same pattern the next day with some back shoulder blade pain that kept me awake all night; with one addition the sharp stabbing pain right-sided and under the ribs (just like GB pain). this became unabearable and so visited the casualty Dept; unable to be canulated due to being dehydrated; bloods were finally taken but were nagative; my pain score as the spasm and sharp pains came and went were very hight 8-9/10. I was later transferred to my pivate hospital and looked after by the specialist; where I was treated with IM Buscopan and Morphine Tabs and IM over the next 8 days. My specialist is certain I have SODD but his partner is reluctant to perform the ERCP as the risk of Pancreatitis is high; but I have been started on Diltiazem mg QID and Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg one am and two nocte. what evidence is there to suggest these two drugs will help my symptoms and after how long will I noticce they are haviing an effect; and how long will I need to take them???,2010,2010,45,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Prograf is a medicine that slows down the bodys immune system. For this reason; it works as an anti-rejection medicine. Prograf helps patients who have had a liver/kidney transplant protect their new organ and prevent it from being rejected by the body. This medicine can cause the amount of potassium in your blood-stream to increase. For this reason you should avoid large amounts of foods that have a high potassium content; for example dried fruit; bananas; tomatoes and low sodium salt; while you are taking this medicine; also avoid potassium supplements. I had a bad reaction from eating these foods. I had been warned about grapefruit juice; as it increases the amount of Prograf in the blood-stream. I did not know about the problems with other foods. Being a health food addict; this is what I eat. I had noticed I had not felt good for a couple of days but did not think that much about it. After about 3 days I knew something wasn't right with my body. I went to the emergency room at my local hospital and after many blood tests I found out that I had too much potassium in my body. I was fortunate the level was not that high. It was an easy cure and I'am fine; (no damage to me or my new liver); but I wanted to warn everyone about this. My doctor told me there are many foods that are being tested to see what there reaction is when Prograf is used by a transplant recipient. The new foods being tested are all citrus fruits. Pomegranate and apricots are now being studied to see if they have the same effect as grapefruit juice; (increasing Prograf levels). My doctors advise to me is; "If you eat something and later don't feel well; don't eat it again." Listen to your body. :o) ~Kande,2008,2008,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having "unexplained" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always "pounding;" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi all; Have never been able to post before...so even though I am doing better I thought I would leave a post with some of my questions. First; thanks to the doctors and CC for creating this site. 1. I had a lone A-Fib back in July...none since. Had some PVCs in late July and early August...but hardly any since. I guess I am wondering the million dollar question...how can I keep my A-Fib episode from coming back? 2. I have heard of people having A-Fib once and it not coming back...what are the percentages on this? 3. What are the overall numbers of no A-Fib recurrence for someone cardioverted? That was what was weird about mine...I stayed in it at the hospital for about 10 hours and the meds were not converting me...is this cause for concern? 4. I have been exercising (2 miles 4xs a week); and doing yard work type stuff. I am still afraid to lift heavy objects; and play basketball or football...would any of these things increase the risk. 5. It seems like A-Fib doesn't have to effect life exp. or quality of life...thoughts? 6. I went to see a regional research center EP in mid August. He looked over my myriad tests from both March and July. He said he saw a totally healthy heart and "zero" reason to even do an EP study...I assume there is no reason for another opinion? 7. Docs who cardioverted me put me on 120mg of Cartia and after Coumadin for 3 weeks I am now on aspirin...does this sound about right? 8. My AF just appeared out of nowhere when I rolled over in bed one night...any reason for concern? Thanks in advance...,2006,2006,29,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,: Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on "spectral" and "verapimil". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible. I feel mine very strongly and they leave me somewhat short of breath after continuing for longer than about 1 minute (30-40 PVCs in one minute). I have tried most of the "...lol" meds (sotalol; pindolol; spectral; atenolol; acebutolol; enderal)and a few combinations of the above without any real relief. Though I have been told to just "forget them" I cannot; and they are seriously affecting my quality of life ( I dread getting up from a sitting position and walking because I know I will be "hit" with PVCs soon after I start walking). Could write much more; but in interest of brevity; I won't. : My question is: Is anyone doing cutting edge research or treatment on this particular arrythm? Can anyone help me with this life-altering condition. I am willing to try experimental meds or procedures. Please feel free to call me at 1-808-455-6864 (Pearl City Hawaii); write me at CDR Terry S.

Wichert 801 Date Drive Pearl City; HI 96782 or e-mail me at ***@****. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply. Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as "non-sustained". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one. Thanks again. Terry,1998,1995,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 46 yr old fem. fit & in good health; B/P 110/70. In June '02; I got sick with an illness which had the major symptom of orthostatic hypotension & other organ symptoms. After 1 wk I could only crawl on my hands/knees due to fainting/weakness.I was sent to Stanford Med Ctr for 10 days.Had an echocardiogram; blood tests; tilt table testing; etc.I was on IV only for 10 days.Their diag: Orthostatic hypotension & gave proamitine. Proamitine made me sick & altered.They sent me home 2 days later & my GP took me off Proamitine as he thought I had a bad virus.After 9 wks I started to get better;no more cardiac symptoms;just getting my strength & life back.Then in March 03; I had tightness in my chest; squeezing in left arm.I went to the ER. B/P was 160/100 and pulse was 180.EKG showed no abnormalities.I was given an Ativan and refered to a cardiologist.I did a Holter monitor and a stress echo.Holter showed several instances of 148 BPM while showering; or just sitting and several PAC/PVC's some coming every other beat.Stress echo showed several PAC's & PVC's that lessened with exercise. After reviewing the Stress Echo/Holter;was told I have benign PVC's & PAC's and just deal with them or take beta blockers.I asked why all of a sudden I started having PAC's PVC's they said they didn't know.I asked if they would go away-they said no.Can someone tell me why these all of a sudden cropped up; and what can be done for them? I have multiple per minute and am uncomfortable. Are these as benign as they say? Organs just don't start acting up for no reason do they? What can I do? Thanks!,2003,2003,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I read the article from Science Daily Feb. 08 and the articles on Hepatitis Central; Liver Foundation and Hepatitis Foundation International. They seem real positive about grapefruit. They also list a few drugs which can't be taken with grapefruit. Just came back from my doctor and he said I could have it. He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit! Going to be shot 17 tomorrow and feel good today! UND at 12 week and doc says I have a 60-65% chance of clearing. Thanks to all of you for helping to keep me positive. So; see what you think about grapefruit!!,2008,2008,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,How prevalent is it for some paitents to be prescribed Flecainide for PVC's by their doctors / cardiologists and told to go home and take their first dose and I'll see you this time next year; as I was told; instead; of having the patient admitted for hospital or clinical observation / testing in order to see how their body responds to it first? In my case; I declined the Flecainide for various reasons. Bon-Bon,2007,2009,,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this?,2008,2008,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me. Could you recommend anything. I am hanging by a thread. Thanks.,2001,2001,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been suffering from episodes of pain and discomfort in the epi-gastric area. It feels like I am going to have a heart attack; it is a pressure/discomfort in upper abdomen and back between shoulder blades with palpitations and difficulty getting a deep breath. It seems to come on as an "attack". I find that it happens most during my walks for exercise; when bending over; before or after meals; and also before bowel movements. I have had several tests run: abdominal ultrasound normal; several EKG's normal; Echocardiogram showing MItral Valve Prolapse; Endoscopy showing gastritis; eosinophilic esophagitis; incompetent LES. I have been taking Achipex in the AM and Zantac in the PM. Plus really watching what I am eating. It seems to be OK for awhile and then like out of the blue I will get one of these attacks. I'm not sure what else to try; the Dr's haven't been very helpful. The last few episode I went in feeling terrible and left feeling the same way; their only suggestion is to double up the medicines. I really believe that the episodes are been caused by the esophageal spasms; is there any way to treat that other than double up the Gerd medications?,2008,2008,39,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I have a scheduled ablation this Friday. I was diagnosed with SVT and I didn't even know I had it. I get a lot of palpitations and I am currently on 25mg of beta blocker x2 a day. I want to know if the ablation is worth it. Will it get rid of my palpitations? The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23). I think I had an SVT once and that was a year ago playing basketball; I came down from a shot and landed hard and my heart started beating fast and weird and I couldn't control it. The symptom went away in about 10 seconds. What does everyone think?,2009,2011,23,Male
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!,2009,2009,34,Female
Diltiazem+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called "overdrive suppression". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights! Can't sleep :( Erik,2010,2010,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this "discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out." I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel "normal" again. Thank you for your response!,2007,2007,,
Diltiazem+hypertension,Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?,2006,2006,,

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I believe I suffer from white coat hypertension. Earlier (until a year ago); when I didn't care about my blood pressure; I always had excellent results when my doctor measured it (115-120/60-70). After I started worrying about my heart (not so much anymore; I usually try my best to help people on the heart rhythm community) my BP readings are higher. I feel my muscles get tense and my heart starts pounding when the cuff inflates; and blood pressure is 140-155/80-95. At home; I get similar symptoms on the first measuring; but it resolves and gradually slows to 120/70 after some tries. I measured it one weekend after a good night of sleep and it was 105/55. I was completely relaxed; for once; at that time. What is quite strange; is that I imagine this started when I started using propranolol (20 mg) for PACs and sinus tachycardia. After this; my heart didn't race when I got scared; but beat harder instead. When I was really scared; I actually had bradycardia; but I got a strange sensation that my blood vessels were constricted (may be imagination..) I got my beta blocker changed to metoprolol (25 mg) and I feel my anxiety getting a bit stronger. But now my heart races a bit more in response to anxiety. Can propranolol actually contribute to higher blood pressure with stress? Are my assumptions correct that propranolol works better on anxiety due to the non-selective effect? Is my BP really normal? My heart is otherwise fine with normal chambers; wall dimensions and excellent contractility (EF 78%). I have some PACs but I'm otherwise healthy; exercise 3 times/week and normal weight. Thanks in advance!,2009,2011,29,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello everyone. I am new to this group. I am a 44 year old female. Never had high BP before. It was always around 120/80 except during pregnancy. For whatever the reason it would elevate then. About a year ago during a routine GYN exam; my doctor told me that when I came in and the nurse took my BP that it was very high. 175/115. He asked me if I had previously had any BP problems before and I said not that I know of. So he was nervous for me and wanted me to go to the hospital. But I was able to immediately get an appointment with my primary doctor and went right in to see him. He put me on a BP med which didn't agree with me and so I eventually stopped taking it. When I went back to see him to get a new medication to try; my BP wasn't bad so he said let's just monitor it to see if it goes back up. It didn't. But then it started to be 140/90 and it would sometimes go to 150/90 and now it is 160/100. So it went back up again. I went to see him the other day because for the past week I have not been feeling well and new something was off. I have been having a pain in my neck and hearing a heartbeat in my ear and having a lot of headaches. So he said that he is going to start me on a water pill to see if that helps to lower it. Now previously; in the past I had once been put on Furosemide. I had a bad reaction to it. I had some of the side effects listed under dangerous side effects and had to stop taking it. So I reminded my doctor of that and he put me on Hydrochlorothiazide. I took this for one day and was extremely sick the whole day. I started with some dizziness; and headache; then went to cramps which turned into very bad cramps. I wasn't too concerned at first because I read that as your body adjusts to it you can get a bit dizzy; and headache; and stomach upset. But when the cramps started getting so bad; I got worried. I began having diarrhea This continued on and off throughout the day. I called the pharmacist and asked if this was normal and he said no. That it was not normal and to not take it the next day and to tell my doctor. So I have to tell my doctor today and ask if there is something else I can take. I would like to know from anyone here if there is a water pill that you know of that is gentle on a sensitive stomach. Any advice would help. Thank you.,2013,2013,,Female

In addition to hypertension I have high cholesterol values(Tested on 20/03/2009: Choletsrol was 5;6; LDL= 3;5 ; HDL =1;42; b on 05/05/2009 i did another test in different lab; results were Cholesterol= 6.9; LDL=4;90; HDL=1;20. I do not take any drug for cholesterol;have started using fermented red rice. I am still smoking. " Lodoz"2;5 mg seems to control my blood preasure fine. I don't have problems with heart rate (usually between 70 and 80 during the day and around 60 in the morning) before taking beta blocker I usually had quite high HR (approximately 90) I'm writing all this because it seems that I started to suffer from "Erectile Dysfunction"or at least everything seems to be pretty much different than before. Behavior has been changing during period of taking drug. In the meantime I was reading a lot and would appreciate professional help;advice; suggestions and comments. I have found out that there is not easy to stop taking "BETA BLOCKERS" if needed it has to be gradually. I wonder would it be worth of trying switching to other BETA BLOCKER that is more selective such as "NEBIVOLOL". ; could I switch to ACE inhibitor (was taking one 5 years ago; they were working for me at that time as well.My blood pressure was then marginal and quit after about month and a half) or maybe should I switch to something like "LOSARTAN" Thank You very much for help in advance Kind regards; Bruno,2009,2009,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 39yrs old; white; male; nonsmoker; occasional drinker < 2 drinks per week. I have been exercising using the same routine for more than 20 years. 15-20 miles per week running; 3 days upper body; 1-2 days swimming. I eat basically the same type and amounts of food since the inception of this routine. I currently have a blood pressure 149/90. During runs I get tired momentarily; jog for 20-30 seconds then am fine again for another .5- 1 mile. Runs are at least 5 miles in length. Usually I feel better after runs; but lately feel drained -slight headache.,2008,2008,39,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 44 year old white male and after a recent physical (dec. 2008) it was determined that i am hypothyroid; and now being treated with levothyroxine 25mcg. after normal blood pressure it is now in the hypertension zones 152sys. over 105dis. to make a long story short i am now on 40 mg. lisinopril; with 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide; and 10 mg. pravastatinsodium to combat the hypertension and the higher than normal cholesterol reading. As of today my tsh level is normal but my blood pressure is still up in same high area;it hasnt changed and i still feel jittery; and jumpy. any input on why the treatment is not taking effect. thank you,2008,2009,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I'm wondering if there is a good beta blocker that does not interfer with thyroid meds in the way that propranolol does? Is furosemide a good safe hypertension med if one gives due consideration to potassium depletion? The idea of a heart drugs scares me. I'd rather take a diuretic if there is one that works. Which hypertension medications are best for someone with hypothyroid? Thanks Silver White,2002,2002,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,At my recent physical; my doctor took my blood pressure while I was crying and deemed it high and prescribed me medication for it. This was surprising to me as it normally is around 115/75 to 125/85 except that day when we took my pressure while I was crying it was 161-92. I've been monitoring it since that time (I haven't started the pills yet) and my blood pressure still remains around 115/75 to 125/85 with the a slight increase immediately after exertion (up to 143/85). Is it accurate to read a person's blood pressure when they are obviously emotionally upset and base your medical opinion on that reading? Will taking the pills (hydrochlorothiazide 25mg) cause my bp to drop too much?,2008,2008,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have been being treated with atenolol then started lisinopril @ 10mg; upped to 20 then 40mg over the last 2 months with no change in my BP.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello! I have been on my medical journey for almost 8 years now. I am 29 y/o female; 120lbs 5'6. I have hypertension and vascular insufficiency along with fluctuating aldosterone and renin levels. My blood pressure is currently under control with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 90mg of adalat cc. However; the blood pooling in my legs causes me great discomfort even when standing for short periods of time; I have researched POTS and that seems to fit except for the fact that I have high blood pressure. Has anyone else had similar symptoms as a young woman and found a diagnosis at some point? I have made my rounds to numerous nephrologists; hypertension specialists; pulmonologists; endocrinologists; and cardiologists to no avail other than the suggestion I have hyperaldosteronism that was later ruled out. Renal artery stenosis is also something I have been tested for but some physicians have still suspected it. I am being referred to a cardiologist again due to the increasing issue I have having with circulation. My husband and I don't have kids yet and are uncomfortable even considering the possibility until more conclusive findings occur. Any input/advice is greatly appreciated!!,2014,2014,29,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Thank you so much for answering my questions.I'm a 48 year old female. Along with the hypothyroid problem -I take metformin (500mg with meals)for insulin resistance. I was told it was 'borderline type II Diabetes'. So; would that be the problem then? If so how would I handle that? I've also had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia -though a lot of the symptoms have eased (if not abated yet);since starting thyroid med. The only BP that I take is HCTZ diuretic(hydrochlorothiazide) 25mgs in the morning. Would you consider that aggressive enough treatment? I was prescribed Inderal initially; along with the diuretic. But it caused a problem with worsening hypothyroid symptoms;(blocks conversion of T4-T3)- so I was put on the Ace Inhibitor Altace (with HCTZ). After 2 weeks I was tested and showed a marked problem with creatinine levels. I wonder -if I'm only able to tolerate a diuretic (as it would appear) - whether a change to a stronger one like Lasix (Furosemide) might do some good in dropping the extreme BP spikes? Its good to know hypothyroid doesn't cause the BP problem. I'm wondering if levels of thyroid MEDICATION might - even though levels are presently optimized? BP readings done on multiple days. Thanks so much little0ne,2002,2002,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I have been having a lot of hypertension and tachycardia lately. I take 2 blood pressure medications; 80 mg of Inderal LA; and Norvasc(sp?). I am calm and have my blood pressure taken daily; but it has been up there lately; usually about 160/90 with a resting pulse rate of about 114. I feel some tension in my neck; and I am usually very tired. I have been diagnosed as hypothyroid and also take synthroid. I guess my question is how fast is too fast for tachycardia. My father died of a heart attack with no symptoms. Thanks in advance for any help.,2007,2007,,

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello doctor; I am a 24 year old male who takes Losartan 100; Toprol xl25 and Hydrochlorothiazide 25. Recently a psychiatrist prescribed me Lexapro 10mg and Xanax 0.5 twice daily to hopefully treat the anxiety/panic disorder that has made my life very difficult the last few years. However I am concerned as I suffer from high blood pressure and racing heartbeat and now I am afraid to take the Lexapro as I fear its going to worsen my not so good blood pressure and heart rate. Is this a valid cause for concern? I DONT want higher blood pressure and heart rate. Should I continue taking the Xanax as prescribed if I dont wish to take the lexa? Also is it possible to just medicate myself on Xanax and skip the antidepressants altogether!? Im not depressed; just anxious and riddled with daily panic attacks.,2012,2012,23,Male

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi Dr; I am a 27 year old male with a history of both athleticism and sedentary lifestyle (professional endurance athlete up to 21; and afterward; mostly sedentary after). I am 6'3"; 220lb; with a BMI of 27.5 (overweight as per CDC website). Two years ago (age 25) I used a caffeine and ephedrine 'thermogenic' weight-loss drug for 6 weeks. As i recall; the dosage was apx 20mg ephedrine; 200mg caffeine. I did not intensify the dosage and have not used it since. 18 months ago I had my blood pressure taken; which was at 155/80. Last week i took my BP again at the doctors office - 180/80 (i was very stressed and anxious that day). Today i surveyed my blood pressure while resting in bed; and on a very light diet of fruits and vegetables. It was taken with a personal blood pressure machine at on both arms - no noticeable difference. These are the results: Systolic: 148; Diastolic: 69; Heart Rate: 64 *these are averages from a sample of 16 *outlier not included in sample: 181/72 after argument. Summary: 18 months ago: 155/80 (Physician) 1 week ago: 180/80 (Physician) Present: 148/69 (Personal test) Both my grandfather on my mothers side; and my grandmother on my fathers side have had heart-bypass surgeries. My Uncle on my mothers side had a heart attack at age 60. Thoughts and or Recommendations? Thank you very much for your time and this service.,2009,2009,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi All; I have been suffering form Hypertension for Past 3 months .I feel giddiness . I went to cardiologist and When I was diagnosed ; I had BP around 160/110 and Pulse rate 93 BPM. I took ECG and reading was normal. I gave all the blood test which Includes Kidney profile; Glucose & LDL & HDL. Everything is normal. My doctor prescribed me telmisartan 40 Mg . I took that for one month and later revisited same doctor. Pressure was around 150/100 again. So doctor prescribed me telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide - 40mg tablets. Last month I felt severe giddiness and visited another doctor. She measured BP and it was around 140/90 and she told me that because of elmisartan hydrochlorothiazide tablets ; I'm getting giddiness. She changed the tablet to Losartan 50 mg . Still I face minor giddiness and pressure was not reduced. My questions are 1) Why I got Hypertension at this age even though all my blood results are normal. Is it stress related 2) Should I Take medicines for Life Long? 3) Eventhough after taking medicines also ; my BP never come to 120/80 ? What is the reason? Thanks,2010,2013,29,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,49 yr old; over-weight female with history of hypertension. 3 months ago I received a stint in renal artery for renal stenosis. After procedure BP was normal without mediaction for appx. one month; however hypertension returned and has not been alleviated. Follow-up CT scans and nuclear studies reveal no restenosis. I was placed on Norvasc; Altace and hydrochlorothiazide to control BP at 145/95 (average). Test for vasoactive amines was negative. Since starting medicines partial relief has been given to the flushing and severe face pain which occurred 1 month post stint procedure. Is flushing associated with BP? What is the deciding factor to determine if hypertension is truly idiopathic?,1999,1999,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi - I am new to this forum. Starting a few mos ago; I had sudden onset malignant hypertension (250/150!) - always had low BP before this. Coincidently; also developed a 7cm ovarian cyst on left ovary. I have had US (both kinds); CT; and MRI and some descriptions were simple cyst; hemmoragic cyst; complex cyst; endometrioma (depending on who was reading it). Every Dr I've spoken to has acted like it was a something we could wait and watch while they searched for a cause of my sudden-onset hypertension. However; I also stopped having periods since Sept (the hypertension started in mid-summer) and my FSH and LH are very high; so the Drs say I am in menopause. I just turned 44; which I realize isn't young; but sudden menopause? and why is it a functional cyst if I'm in menopause? Also; my estrogen and testosterone are in the range of someone in normal reproductive years. I keep thinking all these things are related; but the Drs act like they are all unrelated coincidences (one guy actually said I simply had incredibly bad luck - rofl). Has anyone else developed hypertension w/ an ovarian cyst or ovarian cancer? My CA125 was 15 and I have a history of endometriosis on the same ovary (endometrioma removed 12 yrs ago). I also have the creepy bloating that many people on here have mentioned and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Has anyone else else had this sort of combination of things happen suddenly? Especially the hypertension? Thanks in advance for any insights any of you may have. This is the best site,2006,2006,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,6 monthes ago I started getting shortness of breath in the shower in the morning. It has gotten progressively worse. Mostly with exertion. I also get light headed and have dizzy spells. 3 monthes ago; I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. During routine work-up; an echo was done. My pulmonary pressure was 44. They repeated it a month later and it was 43. I was seen by a specialist who felt he needed to do a right heart catheterization. It was normal. An ECG and stress test have been normal. All bloodwork is normal. For the last couple of monthes; I have intermittent pressure down the centre of my chest. It can sometimes last all day for a short time. No shortness of breath associated with it. I am not panicky when it happens. It doesn't feel cardiac to me. In fact; I usually feel fine other than that. Eventually; I feel a "forced cough". Its like a balloon that is deflating and it is sputtering. Its like something is pushing air out. Its weird. The pressure is occurring more and more frequently. The cardiologist that did the stress test said that my blood pressure is constricting my pulmonary arteries causing my SOB. My BP has been ranging 94/50 to 110/76. I take half of a hydrochlorothiazide. My family doctor thought maybe its anxiety so she put me on Buspar. She doesn't yet know about the chest pressure or cough. The Buspar has not changed any of the physical symptoms. The specialist said after the RHC that maybe if it is in fact pulmonary hypertension; it maybe just too early to pick up. Can that be true and what do you think of everything?,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; Diagnosed with variable blood pressure. If I take my BP while seated or reclined - after relaxing; it is always hypotension (ie 68/40; 56/38)It gets even lower at night. If I've just walked in to do so; without relaxing first it always quite high (ie 168/135; 172/139) and takes a long while to come down. Given HCTZ (25mgs) for hypertension. Unable to tolerate Ace Inhibitor (Altace) and Beta Blocker (Inderal). (I take thyroid replacement hormone for hypothyroid and Inderal blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 hormone. The Altace raised creatinine levels). Being hypothyroid I really have to be vigilent about exercise; or the weight piles on. But; I'm really nervous about exercising now that I have this wonky BP. I always thought with hypertension a person's BP was up ALL the time. Are these kinds of WILD swings; common? Should I be limiting activity? I really don't have to do a lot to really raise it from hypotension to hypertension-just walk across the room - so what will exercise do to it? What causes such wide swings? I've struggled to finally get the hypothyroid meds optimized and within range; and I feel pretty good. Now I find out I have this weird BP thing too. What hypertension meds will not interfer with thyroid meds? Would you recommend a stronger diuretic (furosimide)? Does furosimide interfer with thyroid hormone replacement? Is there a hypertension med you'd recommend? Can thyroid CAUSE this variable BP problem? Can thyroid meds cause it? Should I be as scared as I am that my BP is all over the map?

Thank you for your advice and suggestions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Maria You should eliminate salt from your diet. In some patients this step makes their blood pressure much easier to control. You should also not take ibuprofen (found in Motrin or Advil); that whole class of medicines; called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents; can contribute to high blood pressure. Many nasal decongestants can contribute to high blood pressure. You should avoid alcohol and tobacco. If you are overweight; just losing 5 to 10 pounds can make a big difference. Of course; you should take your medicines every day and not skip doses. If you are taking certain herbal medicines; these can sometimes cause high blood pressure also. If the above measures don't work; you could be started on a fourth blood pressure medicine. Before doing that; I would make sure you do not have a rare cause of high blood pressure that would be treated surgically or kidney disease causing high blood pressure. Your doctor should know which tests to order to rule out the causes of secondary hypertension. I do not know what could be causing your headaches. Sometimes if blood pressure is very elevated it can cause headaches. Lightheadedness could be caused by blood pressure being too low. You do not build up a tolerance to these medicines over time. I hope this is useful. Good luck. Feel free to write back with further questions. If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a cardiologist at desk F15.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I went to the doctor yesterday and I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure. I am really skeptical about taking this medication; or any medication for that matter. I am 21 years old and I cannot figure out why my blood pressure is high in the first place. I do have a lot of anxiety problems and I wonder if that contributes to it. I also take Paxil for my anxiety and I have been told that can cause high blood pressure. So my questions are: Is hydrochlorothiazide something that can be discontinued later after my blood pressure lowers or is it a drug that is meant to be taken long term? Has anyone had experience with Paxil causing high blood pressure? Thanks.,2011,2011,20,Male

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Based on my analysis of blood tests; my 70-year old aunt currently has Stage 3b CKD and is actually close to Stage 4. Back in 8/2008; her GFR was 49.5. A year later; it's 32. This is a loss of 17.5ml/min over 12 months. Every test I looked at; her BUN (22-23); Creatinine (1.3-1.6) and Choloride (112) are elevated. I suspect it was out-of-control hypertension which caused her kidney function to deteriorate. I measured her BP at 200/110 several occasions over the weekend. She says she was stressed out on weekends. But her resting BP on weekdays was still around 160/100. I don't know what her internist has been doing but they apparently thought her hypertension was under control. She stopped taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg; something she was on; a while ago. I put her back on it and made an appointment with her internist so that a nephrologist can be seen. What are we looking at here? Am I correct in my analysis? I had to self-teach nephrology in 2 days! I'm more concerned about the rapid decline in GFR than her 3b being so close to 4. We just ordered her November blood results to be sent and I'm afraid to look at the results and see really how low her GFR has gotten this time.,2009,2010,45,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi there. I am a female; 19 years old; otherwise in good health and weight. My electrophysiologist recently put me on a beta blocker (Metoprolol) 25 mg twice a day for hypertension and a ton of other symptoms he said must be due to Neurocardiogenic Syncope. I was diagnosed with asthma a couple years ago and it seems as if the beta blocker is causing shortness of breath and a feeling that seems similar to how I feel after exercising; a sort of chest tightness I would say. Is this common for beta blockers to do to people with asthma? I am afraid that the dose will be increased as my blood pressure is still high (last two readings were 132/100 and 140/92). I am going to talk to my PCP tomorrow about it as well.,2008,2009,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I recently suffered severe pain abdominal after taking Tylenol #3's for a migraine. I was told that codeine causes spasms of the sphincter of oddi. Felt like the most terrible gallbladder attack of my life - altho I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Since then; my abdomen just under my ribs on BOTH sides is really sore; but particularly bad on the upper left side; going into my back. Kind of a dull boring pain - unless I move suddenly without thinking - then its severe. I don't know if its coincidental that this came on after the 'oddi' incident or not. I DO have a small hiatal hernia. I take thyroid replacement hormone; Metformin 500mg 3 times a day with meals; and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. WOULD ANY OF THESE MEDS CAUSE THIS KIND OF PAIN? SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT PANCREAS PROBLEMS? STONES? WOULD THE HERNIA CAUSE THIS TYPE OF PAIN? I'm a 48 year old female. Thank you! little,2002,2002,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a mother of one child and trying for a second. My first pregnancy I was on Aldomet for hypertension and did just fine. Now my MD would like to try Metoprolol 25mg bid for this pregnancy; when it happens. I cannot take the ACE inhibitor I usually take and I am now on the Lopressor. Does anyone know of a woman that has taken Metoprolol and what are the risk factors w/ pregnancy? Is it really approved to take during pregnancy? Do you know if miscarriage rate is greater w/ this drug?,2007,2007,,

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a a 48 year old male approx 50 pounds over weight and have mild hypertension. I have been on Statin therapy; Zocor; for about 2 years and my blood pressure had dropped from 140s/90s to 120s/80s. I was recently put on Celebrex for my arthritic knees and during this time I have seen my blood pressure increase to low 130s/mid80's. Could this be the result of taking Celebrex? It has leveled off now and I know these are not dangerous numbers; but I would be more comfortable back where it was. I have had great results with the Celebrex; but should I look for an alternative?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I just today had a doctor prescribe hydrochlorothiazide to me. I filled the prescription and then came home and phoned my oldest friend in the world; a 59 yr old Internal Medicine specialist to talk to him about it. His initial reaction was; and I quote; "I wouldn't take that stuff!". He told me that I should tell the first doctor that; after researching the hydrochlorothiazide; I am fearful of taking what he prescribed and that what I would like is for him to prescribe an ace inhibitor. I have NEVER liked taking pills and am not sure what to do. Any thoughts? I will be 59 yrs old in 3 months. btw; the first doctor also prescribed 81mg aspirin. My doctor friend back east told me that the most recent studies have shown that an aspirin regimen has little to no effect on someone until AFTER they have had a heart attack or other... Any thoughts and or comments would be greatly appreciated. I realize you cannot diagnose or direct me. I am just looking for another opinion regarding these different classes of drugs. I am not interested in getting gout; diabetes; kidney or liver issues; etc... Thank you.,2015,2015,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 34 yrs old male; from India. I am overweight by 30 - 50 lbs. I try to exercise everyday and have developed fair stamina by exercising. I have an average to good physique. Till now; the only physical problem I have is Hypertension. I used to take Amlodopine 5 mg tablets fdaily or a long time [5-6 yrs]. Before 2 years the drug was chaged to 'Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide'. This is also a same 5mg tablet that I am taking daily. Recently my BP is more in normal range; even if I dont take the BP medication for a couple of days. I used to masterbate since I was 14. Have a very good sex drive. I think out of fear of impregnating my partner; whenever we do sex without a condom; I use to come very fast. But with a condom I can go on for 5-10 mins of thrusting apart from all the foreplay before it. - I used to follow the 'start and stop' method. Since last 2 months; I am noticing that; I do not have much control on my ejaculation. As soon as I proceed for penetration; I am coming too fast; even within 1 min. Sometimes as soon as my partner touches my penis. - Also; I am noticing that; I can not force the flow of my urine as I could do in past. Are both of these happenning because of weak PBG muscles?Can only kegel cure these? Should I stop my BP medication. Please suggest; what action should I take. Thank you very much Doctors for your help beforehand.,2011,2011,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern. What typically used to be 120-125/70-72 has started to creep up to systolic pressures in the 145-155 range with little or no change of the diastolic pressure. It seems as I age; presently 64; isolated systolic hypertension is beginning to appear as it did with my parents. Thanks; Cody,1999,2006,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I've noticed over the last few years that my top number is going up; although my bottom number is around 70. Each doctor seems very unconcerned; and they always seem to blame it on stress. Well once it was my physician and I had a bad cold; the next time it was at my dentist's; and today at a rather stressful checkup for something unrelated. I always had around 115/70; but now it's been at around 125-130 and today it was 143 (although as I said; I was FILLED with anxiety at this visit...) The bottom number today was 73.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 38 year old black male in excellent shape!! Two years ago I began having Palpitations which continues today. I reported my symtoms to the Flight Surgeon (FS). The Flight surgeon ordered an 24 hour monitor which showed I was having PVCs; about 4-5 per day. Also the monitor revealed I had a non-recurring 4-beat run of V-tack which brought about more test. I was given the Treadmill Stress test; Echo; Stress Echo; Calcium Florscope scan; chest X-ray; and a Thalium Stress test. All of the above mentioned test reveall my heart was normal no MVP or anything. The test however; did stress me a bit; so I now take 12.5mg Hydrochlorothiazide and 20mg of Zesttril daily for mild Hypertension. My BP is well controlled 116/72. My question is: Can an individual have a v-tack episode and have a normal heart; does one's heart need to be electrically or structural abnormal for this to take place? And what do I do about these PVC's? The FS say to forget about them until I am able to take a Bata-blocker after my Military flying career is over.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I'm 4 weeks pregnant & had high BP before becomiong pregnant. I was on Toprol XL 25 mg once daily. I went to an OB/GYN today who said my BP was still running high and upped my dose to Toprol 50 mg once daily. When I called my pharmacist; he said he did not think Toprol was the best thing to take for BP during pregnancy to ask for something safer. My questions are: Is it safe to take Toprol during pregnancy? If not; what BP medicine should I ask my OB/GYN to put me on? My BP is about 133/90-100 on average. I'm 27 yrs old; & this is my 2nd pregnancy. I DID NOT have toxemia during 1st pregnancy. But developed high BP after the birth. Thanks.... LPN Girl,2007,2008,,Female

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 49-year-old man who has been diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency ; along with as-yet unhealed leg ulcers of my lower left leg for the past three years. In addition; I suffered a stoke this spring when plaque in my Carotid artery broke free and entered the brain. Also; moderately high blood pressure necessitating the use of 40mg of Diovan each day; along with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide each day to control the blood pressure; along with statins to control cholesterol and hopefully gradually dissolve the plaque buildups. Now recently; my brother suffered a heart attack; putting him on ventilator; necessitating a transfer of him to a rehabilitation facility about 7 hrs away. Now; I have been driving the 14 hr trip every other week to visit with him. Now; my concern is; (I would normally take this up with my physician but I don't see him for another 2 months).....Am I at any greater risk of developing a clot (DVT) in the leg with the ulcer; leading to a pulmonary embolism....because of my circulatory issues with my leg and my high blood pressure ? I understand that some people who travel by plane frequently or are otherwise forced to sit in a fixed position for long periods of time are at higher risk....but would my circulatory issues increase that risk even more ?,2009,2009,,Male

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have taken a large amount of medications over the last 20 years: Depakote ER; Remeron; antipsychotic for short time; Hydrochlorothiazide; Atenenol; Trileptal; Luvox; Synthroid; Tiazac; Lipiter; insulin and some others. I have struggled most of this time with uncontrolable diarreahea. Eventually I started taking Imodium AD which helped to some extent. After a colonoscopy and tests for anything that shouldn't exist in the colon; ie: parasites etc. my surgeon told me my problem was all the meds I was taking (it was enough to kill me) that my colon is healthy. Working with my other doctors I have reduced a number of the meds without harm. I am still on meds for Diabetes; for Hypertension; and for Low Thyroid. Generally; I am in good health; physically and mentally active. However; I still suffer the diarreahea that comes in fits after I eat a meal and often when I am out shopping; or walking for excercise. I find the Imodium helpful to some extent; but I can never be sure it is enough to prevent sudden bouts of the diarreahea. I drink plenty of water daily to prevent dehydration and eat conservative meals. I have lost 30 pounds intentionally as I was overweight due to medications. There is no blood or "fats" in the stools. They are a normal medium brown in color; sometimes they have been very dark almost black. Seldom have I appreciated a solid stool. I have searched the internet regarding IBS; IB; Colitis; etc. and have yet to find my symptoms of anything to match. It is as though I have too much water in the colon to be absorbed normally and everything just washes out at its own will. If you have any thoughts regarding this matter; I would greatly appreciate them and anything I can do to correct my problem. Thank you.,2009,2009,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 45 year old female and had a baby 3 months ago. I developed hypertension after she was born and was put on 200 mg Labetalol twice a day. It did what it was supposed to do; however I also developed post partum anxiety/depression and was put on Escitalopram; Alprazolam (as needed) and klonopin (1mg) at night only. The side effects of the labetalol for me were awful; so once my readings got better; I weaned off of it and am now not taking anything for Bp which usually stays in a good range (120-135 over 78-85). Some days it's a bit high and some days it's normal. 2 nights ago it spiked to 163/99 and my heart rate went down to 51. This concerns me as I had Bradychardia after my baby was born and the BP was high; but it went back to normal. It went back to normal/borderline over the past couple of days; however I also started taking Hydrochlorothiazide the morning after the spike (prescribed by my ENT for pressure and tinnitus in my left ear). So I guess my question is; is the low heart rate normal with that type of BP spike? They did an echocardiogram when I was hospitalized after my baby was born and said it was fine and my EKG's were fine; etc. Obviously with my anxiety; this still worries me. My cardiologist does NOT want to change my BP med; even though I told her that the side effects were bad on the labetalol and made my anxiety worse. I know there are a LOT of BP meds out there. I am not breast feeding; so that isnt' in the equation. Thank you for your help.,2013,2013,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,For months I have had dizzy and lightheaded spells when standing or walking. It all started in March when I was homeless living in a motel. Was driving and felt really dizzy. Pulled over dialed 911. At the hospital was discharged with dehydration. Next 6 weeks; still lightheaded when walking or standing. Went to clinic and was diagnosed with hypertension 145/93 and a ear infection. Was put on Azithromycin and Hydrochlorothiazide. 1 week later checkup; still had ear infection and high blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control. Thanks - Cody,1999,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello I've been diagnosed with PAC's for 25 years; noticed them from time to time but once diagnosed; never thought that much about them. They are not enjoyable; but at the same time; not that serious. About 3 years ago I had extensive lithotripsy (3K pulses) to remove a large kidney stone; since then I've had several other stones; none that required ESWT; but noticed a general rise in my B.P. It went; over a period of 2 or 2 1/2 years; from 130/82 to 180/107 on a regular basis. Suspicions arose that perhaps renal artery stenosis had occured and I was placed on a number of B.P. meds; none of which helped. My most recent MRA showed no stenosis of the main artery to either kidney. At the same time as the MRA; I was placed on Hydroclhlorothiazide. Within a few days; my blood pressure had dropped to 107/72; sometimes even lower. At the same time; my incidence of PAC's increased quite noticeably. I had been given propanolol to use if needed for the PAC's and took it rarely. Now I need it often twice a day. Is there any relationship between the lowered B.P. and increase in PAC's or am I just noticing them more due to the lowered B.P.? I can live with the PAC's as I much prefer that to the hypertension problem; just wondered if there is a connection. I'm taking; in addition to the hydrochlorothiazide; Benicar 20mg/day and Coreg 10mg/day. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated.,2007,2007,,

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Since the beginning of this year I have been getting pretty ill. I would feel ok one minute than the next I would have some diarrhea and some vomiting most recently I had a lot of vomiting diarrhea and when I get these episodes I would sweat profusely and get verry weak and tired. I would go to the emergency room and they would tell me that it either my diet change ( as per my Endocrinologist ) or most recently food poisoning ( I was told my white blood cell count was a little high; they didn’t give me antibiotics ) which is why they called it food poisoning or they’d say I had a drop in potassium/dehydration. I am getting so sick of not knowing what is going on and I’m sick of the pain; dizziness the weakness diarrhea and vomiting it happens every couple of months. I have had dozens of blood test 2 CT Scans one with contrast one without and out of all of these tests alls I know is that I’m hypertensive and I have stage 2 kidney damage. Has there been anyone else with these symptoms?,2010,2010,44,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,BACKGROUND: I'm 28 living in Madrid and recently given Losartan (100mg) hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) to control hypertension. Because I'm pretty young for hypertension this prescription was also accompanied by an extensive batter of tests (blood tests for kidney and liver function; ultrasound of heart; kidneys and major arteries; electrocardiograph) which all returned very normal results indicating primary hypertension. While I don't love the fact that I'm in my twenties and need medication for something I've always associated with much older people; it does run in my family on both sides and I'm glad that it's currently controlled. DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM: For several weeks I had been experiencing mild; but regular; pain in my abdomen/rectal region. It was relatively dull; and thus generally difficult to pinpoint where exactly; so generalizing it as lower abdominal and rectal pain. Unfortunately over the last two weeks it seemed to progress somewhat rapidly. Included things like pain in my lower back/sides; and a constant feeling of needing to stretch (bend over at the lower back). It was worsened after lots of walking and lessened somewhat when sitting/resting. TEMPORARY RESOLUTION: I understand that this is not a good idea; but after week of feeling like a problem was escalating I went off my blood pressure medication for 4 days to see if it could have been a side affect of the drug. Within 36 hours the pain was completely gone. I immediately made an appointment with my physician; at the time feeling relieved that I had identified the problem as a simple and reversible side affect and assumed that among the plethora of hypertension treatments out there that another one would likely be better tolerated. Additionally; the Mayo Clinic lists "abdominal or stomach pain" and "lower back or side pain" under "more common side affects on its website. (http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/losartan-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20067341) Again; I understand the implication of going off medication without seeking professional advice first; but I was traveling in another country where I do not speak the language and was unable to reach my doctor by phone. I've discussed it with him and assured him that I'll be sure to get in touch with him before ever making a similar decision. Additionally; feeling that my several day test was enough to inform my conversation with my doctor; but not wanting to continue without his advice I went back on the medication and several hours later began noticing the abdominal and side pain (back pain seems more mild; but also manifested last to begin with). That seemed pretty definitive to me that I'm just not tolerating this treatment well. FOLLOW UP: So yesterday I had my appointment with him; and was surprised by the response. He said that losartan has no interaction with the GI tract and that he things my discomfort is caused by a lumbar nerve. He ordered a lumbar spine x-ray which I have on Monday; and prescribed ibuprofen. He asked if I've had diarrhea or constipation (I haven't been tracking closely; unfortunately but I don't think so); pain in my legs; and that's it. There was also zero physical examination of my back; and limited questioning about my back symptoms before ordering the x-ray; which struck me as unusual but I made the appointment for exam and follow up for next Tuesday. I also told him that I had some concerns about the diuretic (hctz) as I already urinate frequently; and I wondered if the addition of a prescription diuretic was "overactivating" my kidneys in some way. He dismissed that fairly quickly; and I'm not very concerned about my kidneys after all the initial testing; but trying to include the observation in all conversation. Last night I called my mother in the US (a nurse) who ran this all by a family friend who is a physician (internal medicine) who agreed that I should stay on the losartan/hctz (although he noted that he thinks 100mg/12.5mg is very aggressive first step into treatment); but was much more curious about bowel movements and whether or not I had experienced constipation or diarrhea. NEW QUESTIONS: I suppose more than a second opinion (although appreciated); I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with abdominal pain or back/side pain while on hypertension medications? If you were able to get past them; do you feel like I've left out critical information in my conversations with my doctor? Unfortunately because my Spanish language; and his English; are somewhat limiting our ability to communicate about this to the level I'd like I have to do a lot of preparation in advance of my appointments to make sure I can describe things well. Would love any input so I can try to more effectively describe what's going on and make sure he has all the information he needs; and hopefully having me a bit less confused. Thanks for any help!,2015,2015,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have had eratic blood pressure for the last 3and 1/2 years. In 2005 I was diagnosed pre-hypertensive; my BP was 155-160 over 80-90. When I am at my Gynecoligist's office my BP is high 160/92 before the exam and then lowers after 130/80. Except this time; it was 162/99 and after went down only to 150/90. My Gyn Dr. said to monitor it for the next 2-4 weeks and if it stays above 140/80 to go to my PC physician and get on some meds. I suffer pretty bad from seasonal allergies and have been coughing and sneezing alot. I have had some quick pains in my chest (left side) but they don't last long (10 seconds or so). I have not been sleeping at nigh; partly because I am worried that I am going to 'Stroke out'. My brother is a Fitness Director/trainer and told me not to go on BP meds that they are bad for the body. Is there a pill that is either low key or 'natural' that I may be able to take? and has it been too long with this high bp?,2008,2008,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have been experiencing very bloated; swollen; painful; stiff ankles for about a year now. If my pressure goes up above 110 over 70 flat; then my ankles swell a lot; and it takes doubling up on all hypertension medications to break the cycle and come all the way down to 110 over 70 flat. But if I have to stay up late; or if I have a lot of going to do; or if I have to go up and down a lot of stairs; which happens often; or if I get stressed out for three days in a row; MY ANKLES BLOW UP AND STAY UP UNTIL I OVER MEDICATE DOUBLING UP ON ALL THREE MEDICATIONS FOR A WHOLE WEEK. Then I will be stuck with a week's worth of medication missing AND MY ANKLES GO RIGHT BACK UP UNTIL I DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. The doctors and the coverage have no viable solutions to any of these problems; we did cardiologist; we did hormone levels for women's health to see if that threw of the other adrenal related hormones; we did thryoid testing; we did gastrointestinal testing; we did mental health; we did orthopedics; we did carotid artery testing; we did electro-veinous circulation testing; we did bone density testing; we did moderate exercise in a chair with moderate walking; we did leg therapy to strengthen muscles and work on underused leg blood gates; MY ANKLES ARE SWOLLEN TWO WEEKS OUT OF FOUR AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING A THIRD HYPERTENSION MEDICATION OUT OF THE COVERAGE; OR THE DOCTOR. WE HAVE NO DIAGNOSIS; WHAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS; AND WHY ARE NONE OF THESE TREATMENTS WORKING???,2009,2009,50,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have a perplexing case study for which I have been able to offer little help to this patient. I hope there is someone out there who knows about this condition or who can direct me to someone who does. She is a 66 y.o. white female who presented with cc of; "I've got a burning sensation on my lips. I've had it for 20 years. I have gone to many different dermatologists; physicians and ENT's who have given me some creams to put on my lips; it hasn't helped and now my entire mouth is burning." She stated that her palate; gums; lips and tongue burned and it would come and go. It gets a little worse as the day wears on. Her latest episode of it occurred after she brushed her teeth using Sensodyne toothpaste. Clinical exam showed no obvious reddening of the soft tissue areas. Pt. is taking several medications. They include: Ativan for depression; hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for hypertension and Benazepril (ACE inhibitor for hypertension); Imipramine 50 mg for depression; and 81 mg asiprin for prophylactic arteriovascularity; and hydrocodone for back pain(2 yrs; possibly addicted to Lortab). Burning Mouth Syndrome came to mind for me as top on the differential; but what is causing it? The patient swears that it all started after she got her braces on when she was about 46. "they poked into my lips; which created sores and they've been burning ever since." I suggested taking her off the ACE inhibitor. They have been shown to increase the incidence of BMS. I also suggested drinking plenty of fluids and using Biotene mouthwash and toothpaste instead of the alcohol containing mouthwash that she has been using everyday. The Bioten exacerbated the burning sensation. She used it for two days and could not take the pain so she quit using it. What else can be done?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I am a 43 y/o male and my normal bp is 120/80 and rhr 69. As of recent I have noted getting dizzy when standing or sitting down and experiencing vasodiatation of the head after exercise. As of recent I have been experiencing pressure in the head; a skipping of heart beat feeling; loss of short term memory and my resting rate is up to 84-90 and bp is at 98/82 sitting and at 118/100 when standing. I have had a complete brain MRI; blood work and all is fine. The change in my rhr and bp ( the closeness of the systolic and diastolic witht he fluctuations in it when sitting and standing) is conserning and the headaches are unbearible. Any ideas...I do have an appt with a cardio and neurologistfor the 27th of March. Any possibilities of the vagus nerve or neurocardiogenic problems. Please solve this mystery....Jerry,1999,2000,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI of 43.5 and a moderatively active lifestyle due to school/work. I walk 30 minutes every day; at a brisk pace. I have primary hypertension despite a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril (I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide but due to my IBS-D I ended up dehydrated and requiring FRT in the ED). Due to my HR being chronically low; I'm not a good candidate for beta blockers so I'm on Lisinopril which just can't seem to manage my BP. My average resting heart rate is 48! I have a pulsation visible in 4/10 nailbeds that coincides with my heart rate; I've since learned it's called Quickne's pulse. I can't remember the last time I DIDNT have edema in my feet and legs. Some days it's worse than others; but every day it's pitting edema. I get a tightness in my chest sometimes and I can't seem to catch my breath. I'm tired all the time. I've gone to my PCP and had several several blood panels; urinalysis; etc with no conclusive results. I've gone to the ED due to the pain in my chest and inability to catch my breath and was tucked away to finish the cardiac enzyme protocol then shipped home with some Maalox as if it was some acid reflux causing my feet; hands; arms and face to swell. SOMETHING isn't right. I'm frustrated and tired of getting the run-around. Please help!,2018,2018,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear Cleveland Clinic Physicians; Background: Male Age 65; high blood pressure; daily medicine doses: atenonol(50mg); vasotec(25mg); hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); imdur(30mg); lipitor(20mg); and aspirin(81mg). When I measure my blood pressure I take three consecutive measurements about 30 to 45 seconds apart. The first measurement is always highest(150/80); the second measurement(138/75); and the third measurement(125/72). What is the correct blood pressure? Is it the first measurement; the average of the three measurement; or the average of the second and third measurements? Also; I take these measurements three times a day and there is a variation. In the morning it is always highest and about an hour after dinner(6:00 PM) it is always the lowest. During the day the highest measurement may be 155/82 and the lowest measurement may be 106/60. Is it unusual for blood pressure to vary this much during the day? It seems as I am aging my systolic is beginning to creep some; however; my diastolic seems to remain normal. Is it time to tweak some of my medications to lower the systolic or should I wait to see if this continues for a few weeks? I first started noticing these changes for the last three or four days. Also; my blood pressure will be lowest about two hours after a 30 minute daily jog. Is there a blood pressure medication that would just treat the systolic and not the diastolic? Thanks; Cody,1999,2006,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was taking Lotensin/Benazepril for a couple of hears for mild hypertension (~145/95) and it was being effective. A few months ago I started having various neurological symptoms including: 1) Numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. 2) Needle-stick like pains in my feet. 3) Trembling of my hands; arms; and thighs. 4) Feelings like being splashed by cold water in my legs; arms; and torso. I had some tests (an MRI of the cervical spine and an EMG/NCV) for possible herniated disk. The MRI was normal and the EMG was "inconclusive" according to the neurologist. The connection to the benazepril didn't hit me until one day. I stopped it and over the next couple of weeks the symptoms decreased markedly but not entirely. I had an appointment with my doctor and we talked about it and he changed be to lisinopril. I took it one time and about 2-3 hours after I took it the symptoms; all of them; were back stronger than ever. Especially the trembling. It's pretty clear to me that there is a cause-effect relationship here. So it's been about 3 weeks since I took the lisinopril and I'm back to where I was before I took it. I have some symptoms; mostly the tingling and the needle-like pains. I see that some of these symptoms; while uncommon; are associated with ACE inhibitors. So my questions are do you think these problems are actually caused by the benazepril and lisinopril? If so; are is the damage they may have caused permanent or should I see improvement over time? I'm obviously very leery about trying another hypertension med. I am seeing my GP doctor in a week. Thanks,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 47 years old male; Ht.5'6"; Wt.150. Exercise regular; non smoker; occasional drinker. I take Concerta for ADD. Have taken Zocor for Cholesterol of 220 which reduced to 165. Take dyazide for blood pressure. BP runs about 145/95 without medication. Rarely add salt to food. Eating habits are fairly decent except for time interval which is very little food usually during the day until dinner time; it seems to be my best method for maintaining weight which will increase very easily. Many years ago I weighed 180 pounds. My doctor prescribed Dyazide for the high blood pressure. After not identifying it as related to medication I was experiencing erection difficulties. Not libido; but maintaining a firm erection. I went off Zocor; and Dyazide 3 months ago for financial reasons and the problem went away. I have started to take the Dyzazide againg and the problem seems to be starting again. It appears the problem is therefore Dyazide related. I am going to see my doctor in a couple of weeks and am trying to be informed before I see him. What medications for treating BP are available that would have the best chance preventing this side effect and not have other more serious side effects?,2002,2002,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My husband died on July 5 while we were at our ranch in a very remote location. He had no history of any heart disease. His mother had arythmea; which was corrected surgically approximately 2 years ago; but no other familial heart disease. He was diagnosed with borderline hypertension approximately 5 years ago; but it was under control with the use hydrochlorothiazide. On the night of the 3rd; when we went to bed; he said his legs felt weird. Not painful; but heavy or numb. The next day; the 4th of July; he said he still didn't feel great; but he felt better. We drove to our ranch; which is in a very remote location; that day and did normal activities; driving around the ranch; etc. My husband grilled burgers for dinner. He had no strenuous activities after dinner. At midnight we went to bed; but he got up after about 10 minutes because he said he didn't think he'd be able to sleep. At 3 a.m. he woke me up to tell me we needed to leave because his heart was racing. He got in the truck; and I got up; and grabbed my purse and my phone. When I got in the truck approx. 2 min. later; he had a seizure. I dialed 911; and got the county EMS; who indicated they would send an ambulance. His breathing was extremely loud - almost like barking- for approximately 2 minutes. As I was driving toward the ambulance; I could hear him breathing; but he suddenly stopped just before we reached the ambulance (about 20 minutes after he woke me up). The EMTs did not start CPR for nearly 10 minutes; and did not seem to be in any hurry to do so. They drove the ambulance directly to the JP's house; who pronounced him dead approximately 40 minutes after my husband woke me up. The JP insisted it was a heart attack; and because this county doesn't have an ME; they have to rely on another county for autopsies. I was told that they absolutely would not do an autopsy because the JP was convinced it was a heart attack. I may never know why my husband died; but I'm hoping someone can tell me if they think this sounds like a heart attack or something else. Is there any way we could have known he was in trouble? Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I went yesterday for cataract surgery; this was canceled. My heat rate was 36 to 50 bpm; with pvc's about every 3rd beat. I have had a very low heart rate for at least 10 years; (39 to 44 bpm; resting) and a "heart murmer" since 12 years old; I'm now 74. I take Enalapril (5 mG); Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mG); and Lovastatin (30mG). My regular Dr wanted a second opinion before he would OK the cataract surgery. I went to a cardiac specialist who gave me an "echo cardiograph" and a stress test; on meeting with him a week later he classified me as "a low risk for the surgery". No mention was made of the pvc's at all; and he did take an EKG. When I took the stress test my heart rate went from 42 (resting) to 124bpm; and all was pronounced OK. I did not experience any feeling for the pvc's at all. What should I do to correct this problem? What medications are suggested? Could the stress test have started this pvc episode?,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. My blood pressure before I was put on medication was averaging about 160/95 on average; sometimes going into the 190/105+ ranges. I was recently put on Hydrochlorothiazide (25mg twice a day) to lower my blood pressure. This has helped lower it to somewhat but I'm still seeing the 140/90+ ranges constantly. I have had several EGKs; everything fine; chest x-rays - fine; blood tests - all good; and several urine tests which all came back good (except 1 last test). I am constantly having chest pain and have been having it on and off for the past couple weeks. The past week it has been especially bad. It is a constant pain; sometimes dull; sometimes sharp pains like someone is stabbing me with a knife in the heart and it will radiate to my left arm. I am very easily winded; like walking up stairs will make me breath heavy and I feel exhausted. Several times my heart rate has been 110-116 resting. The last time my heart was racing I had just gotten up for bed and was getting ready for work. I hadn't done anything physical; and only had a half a glass of pop. The doctor keeps telling me everything looks fine; and for some reason whenever I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal; yesterday it was 125/75. I immediately went home and checked my blood pressure and it was 145/89ish (after 5 minutes of resting peacefully). Every time I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal yet when I go home it's high. I honestly think either his machine doesn't work properly or he's taking the reading wrong. I have a good blood pressure monitor at home; and I follow the steps exactly as the manual states. The machine is rated for clinical accuracy within 5 points and other people who have tried it come back normal. I am worried that the readings my doctor is getting aren't accurate and he doesn't think it's as bad as it is. I've told him of my chest pains; how they come and go and get worse with moving around or doing light housework; etc; yet he feels I should be working. I have an extremely high stress job; sit for extremely long periods (my shifts are 12 hours); I work 2 days; 2 nights. Should I see another doctor? I really don't think I should be working until the pain is gone for good and my blood pressure is lower. I have no idea why the rapid increase in heart rate is happening either. The doctor thinks it could be the medication he put me on but it doesn't happen every day; only once in awhile. Any thoughts would be appreciated.,2008,2008,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Ray on June 05; 1999 at 11:49:17 Several years ago it was discovered that I have a horseshoe kidney. Each urinalysis for the past 10 years has indicated blood in my urine. Is this to be expected with this congential condition? Also; recently; I had a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with Bactrim DS. This is the first infection I have had in ten years. One additional question; will diuretics such as Bumetanide or Hydrochlorothiazide have a harmful effect with horseshoe kidney?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi I am new to this forum. I am 46 years old 5'4" and weigh 305 pounds. In the last six months I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure; high cholestrol; type II diabetis. I have horrible osteoarthritis in both knees and am currently receiving a series of shots in my knees. I have degenerative disc disease and herniated disc L-4 and L-5. I have horrible pain in my left outer thigh. It is sporadic; but when it happens all I can do is scream!!! It feels like fireworks on going off. If anyone know what that is or has any advice please let me know. My doc put me on gabapentin and said it is neuropothy; it has not helped at all. The last several months my feet and ankles swell to the point I can't walk! By the way I can only stand for a very short time; like 20 or 30 seconds without having to lean againt something or sit down.I have been fighting with my insurance company Health Alliance HMO to have Lap Band Surgery! They keep denying me due to my hypothyroidism. They insist my thyroid needs to in the normal range for a minimum of six months. I am on 200 mcg of Synthroid and it is still not normal. My endo stated that should not stop my surgery! I will die without it! If anyone can help with any advice I would appreciate it greatly! My husband passed away from pancratic cancer in 2005. Therefore; it is me and my wonderful sixteen year old daughter! If something happens to me she has no one. My mother died in 1999 and my father died last year. I am an only chlild and so was her father. Here is a list of my meds: Synthroid 200 mcg; methadone 60mg; lipitor 10mg; celexa 50mg; hydrochlorothiazide 50ng per day; metformin 500mg; didrex 50mg 3xday. I also take a multi-vitamin; fish oil and an low dose asprin daily. Thank you for any advice you can give! Again it is 3:00 am so I am sure I am rambling. I had a lot to say & really didn;t know how to get it all out! Thanks again!!!!!,2009,2009,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 40 yrs/male. I work out 5 times a week: walking; running; cycling. I am a little on the heavy side 6'0 209lbs. I don't drink; I don't smoke. My cholesterol are normal. My blood pressure most of the time is normal 124/77. Occasionally I would get some kind of "attack" where my BP is 124-138/92 . When I get this attack my feet and hands feel cold; my heart rate increases; and I feel a little bit light headed. this happens maybe 1-2 days in a week or 2. My doctor gave me 12.5 hydrochlorothiazide. This does not help. It does lower by blood pressure further down (106/65) on most days but I still get this "attack" occasionally. 2 years ago I did stress test and the result was good. How long the result is valid? I absolutely have no clue on what is happening to me.,2011,2011,38,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello my name is Dale. I am 23 years old and since the age of early 21 I developed a very odd case of hypertension. Whereas my old blood pressures where in the 120/75 range suddenly I developed 160/90 blood pressure. Since then things have really gone downhill. I have developed pretty severe anxiety and basically dropped out of school about 1 1/2 years ago. That's not the worst; I have been dealing with severe heart palpitations and heart flutters in the last year; and about 3 months ago I suddenly developed shortness of breath that has stuck with me to this day. I was exercising pretty regularly up until this shortness of breath started and had actually managed to lose some weight; however since the shortness of breath started it has become nearly impossible; although I still manage to ride my bike even with the shortness of breath. Recently I consulted a Doctor of Osteopathy who performed some saliva tests on me and they showed that my cortisol levels were pretty elevated; im not sure if this consitutes Cushings but was wondering if you guys could comment. Also I should add that even on 3! Count it 3! Blood pressure medications Toprol XL 25; Losartan Potassium 100mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg I am still averaging high blood pressure readings 140-150/80 . When I went to the hospital with the shortness of breath it had climbed to 190/100 and at that time I was on only the HCTZ and the Toprol. So my cortisol Morning- 8.7 Midday-8.2 Evening-6.4 Night-4.3 Reference Ranges are supposed to be Morning- 2.0-10 Midday- 3.0-6.0 Evening- 2.0-4.0 Night- <1.5 Also my DHEA is elevated slightly at 671.1; supposed to be under 644. So I guess my main symptoms are 1. Shortness of Breath 2. High Blood Pressure 3. Heart Palpitations; flutters. 4. Chest Pain,2012,2012,23,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My triglyceride level used to be at the 78-85 level in the past 3 years. Yesterday my blood test shows a triglyceride level of 125. My HDL is also slightly lower than my last year's result. About a year ago; I had a change of medication to Diltiazem 120/24mg for my high blood pressure. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker. Will Diltiazem change triglyceride and/or HDL levels? Anna,2010,2011,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,History: 43 year old male w/ history of anxiety and panic disorder. These emotional disorders were in remission until a flare-up last August. At that time; I began psychiatric treatment with cognitive therapy; along w/ Klonopin .25 mg X 2; and Zoloft 25 mg. X 1. (I am still on this treatment; and the anxiety and panic is well under control.) Last August; during the height of my panic; my BP was at 150/95 and heart rate at 100. My cardiologist was convinced this was due to my emotional state; and said once my anxiety is under control; my BP will subside also. (I always had good BP and low HR in the 60's.) Cardiologist prescribed Toprol XL 25 Mg a day; and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day.....Now; with my anxiety under control I am getting morning readings of 115/70 with a HR of 56; and evening BP of 106/60 with HR as low as 49. My questions: 1) Is a HR that low dangerous? I'm feeling fine-perhaps a little more tired than before; but no fainting spells. 2) I see my cardio in November; and I'm sure he is going to take me off the meds.....Is there a weaning process involved ? 3) Can uncontrolled Anxiety really cause HBP?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Maria on September 11; 1998 at 09:39:36: Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better. Thank you for your help and I am grateful for this forum.,1998,1995,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the "world famous" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it "stabs and jabs"; another doctor called it "electrical discharge headaches"; another doctor called it "cluster headaches". A previous doctor prescribed "indomethecin"; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide. The pain is far beyond what any human should have to endure. .,2012,2012,49,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I recently underwent a series of test: echo; ekg; stress test; and heart cath. My doctor said I have dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% and left bundle branch block. I have been receiving treatment for high blood pressure for several months. I am currently taking atacand 16mg twice a day; clonidine .2mg three times a day; hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day; norvasc 5 mg once a day; and K-DUR. My blood pressure is still not under control. My question is how much relation is there to the cardiomyopathy and my blood pressure? If my blood pressure is ever under control will the cardiomyopathy improve? What are the risks that the cardiomyopathy will worsen? Is it normal for blood pressure to be so resistant to mediciation? There are others we have tried (lopressor; cardizem; to name a few) with no results. I am 53woman and slightly overweight. My doctor says my blood work looks like a 20 year old (no problems). My father died of a heart atttack at 47 and there is a history of much heart disease in my family. Thanks so much for responding to my concerns.,2000,2000,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My mom was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia approx. 17 years ago. Priror to this she worked as a social worker and after she had me she retired and ran her own daycare out of our house. She seemed fine with it at this time although there may have been small hints of something not right in stories she told the relatives. She's currently 59 years old and in addition to schizophrenia she also has stage II hypertension; chronic headaches; a severe skin rash that leaves open sores over her body (especially when scratched) and sometimes her mouth will twitch to the side (kind of like bells palsy but it comes and goes). Since I was a child when she first developed most of these symptoms I can't recall the exact order in which they occured however I have included them here because I beleive they may be somehow related. She's currently on hydrochlorothiazide and propanalol to control her headaches and hypertension. I'm wondering if one of these medications could also be causing her rash. Her schizophrenia symptomps display as paranoid thoughts beleiving she is being spied upon by 'the neighborhood'; especially the police; school teachers and the liquor store people. She has extreamly poor hygine; rarely baths and goes months without doing the dishes or cleaning up making her house smell really badly. She can become extreamly abusive especially when confronted and asked to acknoledge her problems. When I was a child I remember her occasionally telling odd stories to the relatives however she seemed much better able to take care of herself. Her hygine was much better; she drove longer distances; etc. When she was first diagnosed we brought her to UCLA medical center because she would randomly walk into the neighborhood and keep walking with no where to go. She was treated there for a while and seemed to get better and sent home with medication (although I can not remember which medication it was). Sometime after this I found her lying in bed; slurring her words and cussing really fowl things I had never heard her say before; swearing over and over again. She had taken many boddles of her medicine (I think it may have been hadol or another drug in it's class at that time (approx. 1985). I called the paramedics and they rushed her to the hospital and gave her charchol to neutrialize it. I believe that her overdose may have made her illness much worse. I do not remember her being so absuive before this point; and now she routinely swears and curses at everything. Also afterwards is when I beleive she developed her facial twich and she used to sit in the car stare into nowhere and roll her fingers together. She wasn't on the anti-psychotics for long but could the overdose have given her tardive dyskenia or caused her to be that much more absusive? Is there anything I can do to help her now?,2003,2003,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My potassium levels keep fluctuating...they are now 3.3......I am hypokalemic and I am on Diovan; and potassium supplents......The doctor mentioned Liddles syndrome........Does anyone know anything about this?.....I also have mild MVP....and PVCs'......I'm 51 and going through menopause.....I've also just been diagnosed with osteoporosis........I'm not even postmenopausal; yet.....Does anyone have the low potassium; high blood pressure problem?.......Thank you!,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 41 yr old female; 5'3"; 130lbs and recently had a abnormal echo stress test. I then had a left catherization done and was diagnosed with "hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction". I am on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide meds of which I take 1/2 tablet of a 12.5 mg tablet daily. My cardiologist stated that the diastolic dysfunction is caused by untreated high blood pressure; but I've been on blood pressure meds (hydrochloritiazide) for over 3 years prior to getting this latest diagnosis. My question is whether or not there are any other possible causes of diastolic dysfunction. I've had other symptoms over the last few years (fatigue; weakness/loss of strength; numbness in hands/feet; dizziness; foggy memory; slight carpal tunnel in both wrists per EMG test) and have undergone a few tests (checking for Rheumatoid Arth.; Lupus; EMG test) all of which came back normal. My blood pressure has always been low; in fact too low (81/48 lately) since I've been on the blood pressure meds. I'm just trying to find out if there may be another root cause of why I'm not feeling well. I have two young kids (4yrs and 9yrs) and have actually had a doctor tell me "you feel tired all the time because of the kids". Well; I'm not buying it. Please help me solve this mystery once and for all if possible. Thank you in advance for any insight you may provide. I look forward to your response.,2007,2008,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life. Please help;someone!,2012,2012,29,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted by Ray on June 05; 1999 at 11:49:17 Several years ago it was discovered that I have a horseshoe kidney. Each urinalysis for the past 10 years has indicated blood in my urine. Is this to be expected with this congential condition? Also; recently; I had a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with Bactrim DS. This is the first infection I have had in ten years. One additional question; will diuretics such as Bumetanide or Hydrochlorothiazide have a harmful effect with horseshoe kidney? Is a calcium channel blocker; such as Verapamil; acceptable for hypertension with horseshoe kidney? Posted by HFHS M.D.-CK on June 08; 1999 at 12:47:58 Dear Ray; Horseshoe kidney is a common anomaly with about 1/400 being affected. It is more common in males. Horseshoe kidneys are fused together across the midline. Horseshoe kidneys may be associated with skeletal; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal ; or genitourinary abnormalities as well. One third of patients remain entirely asymptomatic. When symptoms are present; hematuria; stones; infection; and blockage of urine flow are seen. Vesicoureteral reflux and an increased incidence of urologic cancers has been reported. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil are acceptable to use with a horseshoe kidney. This information is provided for general medical information purposes only. Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition. More individualized care is available through our department at the Henry Ford Hospital and its suburban locations (I-800-653-6568). Sincerely; HFHS M.D.-CK * Keyword: Horseshoe kidney,1998,1999,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Ok here it go's. Im really worried about my husband he is 35 years old and he is on 4 different blood pressure meds. He is on Lisinopril 10mg ; Atenolol 50mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Even with all theese meds his blood pressure is still way to high! It seems every doctor visit they add more meds. Ok I guess my question is; is it nessasary to be on 4 different blood pressure meds and is it safe? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :),2010,2010,28,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,64 years old; 6' 2"; 210 pounds; retired; work out daily at a gym. History of high cholesterol. I had a heart attack five years ago. A recent stress test concluded I needed an Angiogram; which lead to two stents installed. The Operative report included: 1. Unremarkable left main. 2. Anterior descending demonstrating two areas of excentric plaque treated with 4 x 12 and 2.5 x 8 stents; with excellent results. This is the area of ischemia on his receont isotope stress. 3. Circumflex free of disease. 4. Dominant right coronary demonstrates multiple areas of non-critical stenosis with intercurrent thrombus. This area was not approached at this time. Inferior wall demonstated scar with no reversibility on his recent isotope stress. 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction 48% with some inferior wall hypokinesis. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 38 pre-; 30 post-left ventiriculogram. I am taking Plavix; Coreg; Aspirin and Vytorin. My questions: l. Since the stents were installed two months ago; I run out of breath and tire rather quickly when exercising or climbing stairs. Does the stenting procedure itself require a healing period; during which time the heart isn't working as well as it could? 2. I'm curious what the left ventricular end diastolic pressure readings indicate. 3. I am having severe muscle spasms in my back; particularly at night; and haven't done anything to aggravate the muscles. I read that Vytorin can cause muscle soreness; but could it also cause muscle cramping? Thank you for this forum.,2004,2006,64,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,hi i am a 29 year old male overweight about 60 pounds i had an episode of afib about 8 months ago;had all the tests run everything was unremarkable;so the cardio put me on 50 mg of atenolol 2 times a day havent had any problems since;i went to my gp and had a physical everything was fine but my bp reading then was 149/84;he said to come back in a month to recheck i just went back and my reading was 153/84;and he said i should try hydrochlorothiazide;in terms a water pill i guess;my question is could that episode of afib been because i high blood pressure?;i have talked to a dr friend of the family and he told me that reading of 153/84 doesnt warrent meds?also isnt atenolol a high bp med? should i be on both?or should i even be on any? i am confused dont want to take pills if i dont have to thank you,2003,2003,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Thanks for taking my ?? I had an echo done nearly 5 years ago ; it showed only borderline hypertrophy; I had a echo done this past Tuesday which the cardio said had progressed from borderline to mild; a change of about 2mm if I remember correctly; B/P was 140/85 in the doc's office; at home every time I take it is always control around 115/70 most of the time. He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate. Thanks.,2005,2005,40,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear Dr. I am female; 45; 5'11" 300lb; strong/not aerobic; drink alot of caffeine every day; take quite a bit of ibuprofen monthly;never smoked;no alchohol. Paternal Family Hx: obesity; arteriosclerosis; hypertension; DMII; colon ca; stroke; mci; bypasses. Maternal Family Hx: breast ca; prostate ca. Childhood hx: scarletina; recurr. ear inf. Events: age 29; orthonovum 1/35 for dysmenorrhea; sudden loss of vision in left half of left eye at work in am-blood pressure high; no hx of migraine; vision faded back in within the hour. No headache till after vision restored; then headache grew to disorienting proportions by night. Discontinued bcp's. Never recurred. age 35; referred by gyn to renal/hypertension dr-good workup; hbp; prescribed Procardia-I didn't like what I read about it; never started meds; never rtnd; no symptoms at the time. Renal clearance/labs wnl. Cholesterol ~220. (Hx recurrent UTI's once a year over 10yr period; culminated in passing of "grit" with ultrasound showing renal ?pyramids? and mildly fatty liver. UTI's never recurred after "grit" episode. Ouch.) age 40; heart ct for a study showed arteriosclerosis-80% of my age group better than I. age ~41; allergies started after severe exposure to kitty litter dust and a throat sinus ear infection that went untreated too long. Since then tb test +; chest xray neg; possible latex allergy; cat/dog/horse/maple tree allergy; flu shot reaction; mosquito bite reaction; peanut butter reaction; severe reaction to bactrim and balloons-both prev no problem-face like blowfish w balloons; large hives and tiny blood blisters w Bactrim. Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; "crossed the border to mild asthma" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the "stroke." I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My "chart" is 1/2" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead. I do not agree with the hormone therapy for menopausal women-but I know it offers some cardiovascular protection? Here comes the wacko question-is anyone in the medical field currently prescribing bloodletting for menopausal women? Thanks-these forums are excellent because focus is on the details; not the first impressions.,2002,2002,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was diagnosed as mildly hypertensive a few years ago (now 47 y/o; ns; nd; normal weight and lipid profile). I ran about 150-160/90's before; now run 130-140/mid-upper 80s on 20 mg Lisinopril qd. I feel like this isn't low enough. I recently had an MRI/MRA of my head for unrelated reasons; and the report came back with changes "most consistent of involutional small vessel white matter changes beyond upper limits of normal for patients age. Consider small vessel ischemic risk factors such as untreated hypertension." Does this mean I need better control of my hypertension? When I am at rest or in the docs office; it is always about 120-130/mid-low 80's. At work; however (night shift RN; busy unit) it runs 140-150/mid to upper 80's to 90. My pulse is rarely lower than mid 90's (80's at rest). Thyroid functions ok. My doc says not to worry; that this is fine. I say that as I work fulltime; my BP's at work reflect my usual state more than resting or office BP's. My family history includes several relatives with longstanding hypertension; stroke; MI; and aortic stenosis. What is your opinion? Aim for lower; or ok as is? What would be the next usual agent to add if a lower BP would be desirable?,2004,2005,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control. Thanks - Cody,1999,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 46 year old male with a history of hypertension for the past 10 years. I am taking 1Co-Eziday(Losartan Pottassium 50 mg+ Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg)(50 mg)tab once a day for the past 2-1/2 years with Loprin 75mg. I also have a deficiency of Vitamin D; detected last month for which I am taking Inj. Indrop D3; orally once a month; plus tab Dolmit; once a day. Since the last 1 year I am experiencing erectile sysfunction i.e. insufficient erection or erection which I cannot maintain for some time. My wife gets irritated due to thjis reason and I also feel a loss of self esteem and reduced pleasure. I consulted a specialist who advised me to relax as; according to him; my problem is mainly stress related. He appears to be right since when I take a break from work or proceed on a vacation; there is a marked improvement. I have almost perfect body weight and exercise regularly. I also do not drink or smoke. Kindly advise me whether I can take the vitamin supplement 'Vigour" produced by the Vitamin Company safely; in view of my medical history. The company claims that it has essential vitamins and herbal supplements which can do wonders.I shall also deeply appreciate any other advice on the issue. ahansari.,2010,2010,46,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 56 years old with a family history of heart disease; hypertension and diabetes. I have had high blood pressure; semi controlled; for 10 years. I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond. The extent of coverage of the pain is only pinpoint area on my chest and forearm. They appear and disappear right at the same time. There is no accompanying tachycardia; shortness of breath; or palpitation. Neither is it associated with heavy physical exertion. Have you had patients with this kind of chest and arm pain? What do you recommend for me to do?,2010,2010,55,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi ; I am a long time member of this forum. On 2008 I finished 1 year Interferon + Ribavirin tx. Since then I feel very well; beside that the liver disease left me with mild Rosacea. About 3 years I started to have mild Hypertension and I decided to take meds - Co-Diovan (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE / VALSARTAN) since then. The blood-pressure was not high but I decided to take meds rather then do jogging every day. Only recently I notices that Urea (B) and Uric-Acid cam above normal right after I started with Co-Diovan. I also started 2 years ago with Avodart and Xatral against slightly enlarged prostate. Recently I had pain in the Thumb toe. family doc gave me diet against Gout. Also I did X-ray for a periodical checkup and the doctor (another doctor) now suspect that I maybe have Ankylosing spondylitis. I am worried. Tomorrow I will make some blood-tests. I would be happy for information. Are there any now relationships between those diseases and HCV or Interferon or the hyper-tension meds that I am taking ? I would be happy for any good information. Thank you; Jack,2007,2017,,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 44 year old male; non-smoker; currently on the following meds: Toprol XL 25 mgs and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgs for anxiety-produced hypertension; along with Klonopin 0.25 mgs and Zoloft 25 mgs for Anxiety and Panic Disorder. I have been on these meds for 1 year with good results. I have always had good lipid readings; however; since beginning these meds; it appears that my lipids have risen. My recent test are: TC-220 HDL-56 LDL(calculated)-113 TRIG-253 CHOL/HDL ratio-3.9 My questions are: (1) Am I a candidate for Statin therapy? (2) Can the LDL be accurate; being that it was calculated with a TG level of 253? (3) Can the current meds I am on raise lipids? (4) As an aside; concerning APO B/A1 ratio; seven years ago I had mine measured and it was 0.82; with A1 being 146; and B being 120....Are these safe numbers? Thanks; Jerry,2003,2004,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type "A" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise. Would this be enough or is medicine the only way to go? thanks for all your time and help,2006,2006,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,hi. I am a 21 year old male who is 5'9" and weighs 160lbs. I NEVER smoke or drink caffeine; and I run four sessions of 3 miles/22 min. of cardio each week. I limit drinking to the weekends (and even then it's minimal); and I do not exceed 1500mg of sodium content daily. I consider myself very healthy and have never had health issues; surgery; or been on meds. nothing at all until now - just out of nowhere. about three weeks ago I had a terrible upper respiratory infection; which sent me to the doctor. he took my BP there and was shocked to learn it was in the 190/105 range; so he ran an EKG and breathing test and both were fine. to be cautious he sent me to the ER; where they performed a urinalysis and another EKG. both were fine. keep in mind; by the time I got to the hospital (10 min later); my BP was down to 156/94 or so. went back to the doctor a week or so later and my BP was still in the high range - now 170/95 or so. he wanted me to go to the ER again; but I refused - saying I prefer taking care of it there since I can't afford to pay $3000 again (I have bad insurance) for the ER. he said fine and prescribed me 5mg of lisinopril and told me to buy a home blood pressure monitoring machine. I have been taking lisinopril and using the monitoring machine I bought (Omron HEM-790IT) for about two weeks now. BP was high at the beginning; but the past week or so has gotten quite better. in the mornings and at night it is around 125/80; and when I return from school/work it is at the most 140/90. I understand the latter number is no good; but I figured it wasn't anything severe enough that an even better diet couldn't change. but again. my diet is already pretty good now here's the odd part: after a week or so of these readings being between 125-140; I went to the doctor's for the first time in two weeks expecting at least SOME improvement. after all; I have been eating extremely healthy; drinking tons of water; and taking lisinopril - in addition to the fact my home BP machine shows readings that are just pre-hypertension or barely stage 1. but when he took my BP; it was STILL in the 170s. I was shocked and he just let out a sigh of disappointment. he prescribed me hydrochlorothiazide to take along with lisinopril; and told me to come back tomorrow after taking a dose of both tonight and tomorrow. he also told me to bring my BP machine; just to compare readings. now; I know what white coat hypertension is; but I thought it only allowed your BP to raise maybe 10 points above normal. I certainly did not anticipate a growth in 30-40 points! I am extremely stressed about this situation... I'm only 21 years old; work out a lot; eat healthy; don't smoke... why is this happening to me? I initially thought it was just due to my respiratory infection; but that has been gone for almost 2 weeks and my high BP is still present. I'm a college student so I am somewhat stressed; but nothing too severe. I feel fine - never any headaches; aches; or anything like that. the only thing that's stressing me out right now is this darn BP. it just seems like I can't do anything... I eat healthy; do everything right; but still... I don't want to be on meds forever it would at least help if the meds were working when I went to the doctor's... any thoughts or suggestions?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I've had Progressive M S for over 4 years now. I seriously thougth I had dealt with all those issues faily well till WAM! In Feb this year I began having seizures! Big ones; little ones; jelly bean jumping full seziures. Treatment was MASSIVE intravenous bags of Steriods.? By May they had all stopped thank you God! But the results from the steriods was extreme! I had gained over 25 lbs! In less than 4 months! In the past week my insurance had changed manufacturers and my medication for Hypertension; TrianterenW/hctz 37.5/25 "CAPSULE"; was replaced with a "TABLET"! On them for about 12 days and I noticed my feet are swelling more and more and more and still swelling! From both legs starting at the kneecap-all the way down to the almost hidden toes. And walking is excruciating! I elevate; drink lots of water (admittedly not every day prior to this time)-cause I am a Diet-Pepsi 'aholic..lol Of course I called the mail order company and they said-sorry your insurance changed in june and now we use Mfg. Sandoz. No replacement possible. I tried using my mom's (i know I know-but it was my old kind); just until I can see my Dr. Nothing!...I even drank water like crazy! My daughter is a Paramedic so when i told her of the problem she asked me to push down on the ankle area and tell her what I saw. I said the dent is still there! It won't re-inflate; so to speak. What does that mean? She said are you having trouble breathing? I said no. She said Physicians diagnose patients by a level of this method; and call the Dr. asap for a visit. Thats 2 days away and now I am a little freightened. I have tried ice; elevation; water and nothing makes it go down. I even wake to the swelling! She asked if I had injured my leg or back at some point recently? The only thing that comes to mind is last week my knee tried to keep giving out on me and had a hard throb to it. I put ice on kept it up and went on with my life. Nothing is changing it. Any ideas about this and has anyone else been through this? Is it M S related? Neurological Dr. changed my injections from Avonex to Copaxone in January...??? I know it could be anything but anyone been through this? I need your help again friends..... Thanks from my fat little feet....>>>>> Spukkie (Spuk),2008,2011,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was "a little off" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested? Lots of questions. : ) Regards; Michelle,2001,2001,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I went to get my first B12 injection the other day and I was shocked that the doctor didn't put on gloves to give the injection. Is this common? Also; they prescribed phentermine (30mg) and the water pill triamterene/hydrodcholrothiazide (75 mg). Since I have high blood pressure; I really want to avoid taking the phentermine since it elevates your heart rate. Has anyone used just the water pill and B12 (along with sensible diet and exercise; of course) with success or is the majority of weight loss help from the phentermine? Finally; has anyone in Los Angeles used the services at Westchester Wellness & Weight Loss? They're nearby and I was thinking about trying them... THANKS!,2008,2008,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am male 40 yrs and I am prone to irregular hb. I have irregular heartbeat quite often. if I drink just 1 cup of coffee or 1 can of soda or if I exercise a "little bit" harder I would have irregular hb for 2-4 hrs. the hb would be very erratic and scary. beep ...beep ..gone beepbeepbeepbeep...gone...beep...beep..gone...beep...beepbeebeep. This started to happen 1-2 years ago and seems to get worse (I become more sensitive; happen more often) . In the past I was a heavy coffee drinker (2-4 a day). I am taking 1/4 of losartan hctz 100mg/12.5 a day for my hypertension. I went to ER and wear holter monitor twice and they said I have pvc . they said it's harmless. I am worried that the diagnosis was not correct. should I be concerned ; why I am having this; is this normal? why it is progressing? I specifically asked the dr if I have afib and he said no. Could it be the hydrochlorothiazide? but it's very very lose dose.,2011,2012,39,Male
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor. Can anyone give me suggestions I'm to young and on to many pills and refuse to be disabled but it looks like that's not gonna be my choice if something doesn't change soon; thanks.,2016,2016,,Female
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,It appears that any significant amount of protein in any form creates several painful and uncomfortable side effects in my body when consumed. This includes meat; eggs; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. For example; if I consume eggs then I get persistent headaches; brain fog; heart pain; increased blood pressure (I’ve had spikes to 165/105); numb and prickly skin; stiff neck muscles/tension; a burning pain in my kidneys; a changed sense of smell (I start smelling a particular thing that isn’t there and/or my skin is creating some kind of specific smell); and in general I just feel like I’ve been poisoned. Any form of exercise increases the severity of the side effects and causes additional pain. Eggs and seafood appear to create the worst side effects; but I get the same or similar symptoms to a lesser extent when eating other types of meat; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. This has lead me to start eating a heavily non-protein rich vegetable and fruit based diet; and has helped my side effects and blood pressure significantly; but this means I have to avoid almost all “normal” food. Does anybody have any clue what might be wrong? I have asked my kidney doctor; but he doesn’t even make an attempt at explaining to me what might be the problem. I have listed a bunch of medical information and history below in case it is helpful. Any ideas at all are appreciated.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have been told that they are recommending lower blood pressures more than before. I am 30 years old male and when the nurse did my blood pressure at work it was about 150/90. This was on two weeks apart. They told me to go to the doctor and then it was 134/76 so he didn't do anything. My blood pressure has been up for about 10 years. I work out and lift weights and do aerobic exercises and am very muscular. I am 6'4" tall and weigh 240 lbs. My parents have a blood pressure device that I use when I am over there and the blood pressure stays around 140-150/90 or about there. Should I go back to that doctor or go to a cardiologist who is a expert in blood pressures? What blood pressure should I have at my age? What else can I do?

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better. Thank you for your help and I am grateful for this forum. Dear Maria; Topic Area: Hypertension High blood pressure; or hypertension ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active - exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. Q: How does medicine help control high blood pressure? A: For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Q: Will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? A: Generally; someone with high blood pressure will be on lifelong medication. Q: At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? A: Usually hypertension can be managed by a Internal Medicine doctor. Q: Will there ever be a right combination (of medication) to treat this condition? A: It may take several trials to find the right combination of drugs. There are many different medications and new ones are coming out each year. Q: My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? A: Heart disease tends to run in families. Those who have a family history of heart problems shoud take extra care of themselves (i.e. weight loss; high blood pressure control; exercise; etc.). Q: Is 250 BP reading Max (85%) on this treadmill a bad reading warranting the patient on BP meds the rest of one's life? A: Not necessarily. But this is an abnormal result and is weighed into the decision to recommend starting medication. Q: Does readings like I indicated above warrant BP medication...Did the 130/80 at the start of this Thallium Test mean that this number is "not Normal" either ? A: Normal BP is 120/80 or less. Blood pressures above 140/90 generally warrant starting medications. If the BP is controlled with life style changes and weight loss it may be possible to stop medications.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Several months ago; I wrote to you about some studies' that show Fish Oil Supplementation has a tendancy to INCREASE LDL. Well; apparently; that seems to hold true; at least in my case. Before Fish Oil my lipids were: TC-180 and Direct LDL-87. Only 6 months later; without a dietary change; my lipids went to TC-235 and direct LDL of 150. Tri's remained boderline high at 170-200. My cardiologist is having my blood retested this week; as he thinks a lab error occured. (1) Is it possible in 6 months for a TC and LDL to Increase that much without significant dietary change? (2) Are Lab Errors Common? (3) The only other medication I added between tests were Zoloft; hydrochlorothiaizide and Toprol XL-Would any of those have a lipid effect?

What if the Lasix stops working; is there another direutic I can take that you know about? 2. I'm really apprehensive about taking the Spironolactone because I know it helps remove ascities from the belley and if you don't have ascities in the first place; does it create a new elimination route to remove the ascities?,2008,2011,,Male

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,PART 1 My non medical opinion. Highly technical discussion of MELDNa calculators vs MELD of Na factor. I kindly suggest that you do not read further especially if you easily get frightened about test results. This is about various ways of MELD scoring including Na factor and where it might apply. It could cause unnecessary fear; be incorrect and/or not apply to your specific situation. These scores can only be evaluated by a hepatoligist or an gastroenterologist experienced in HCV; hepatology and Cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate or severe hepatic impairment; CTP class B or C) should be referred to a medical practitioner with expertise in that condition (ideally in a liver transplant center). (DISCLAIMER) All comments by myself or other members are our own opinions and do not imply professional medical advice. Direct quotes with links provided should be source evaluated. My suggested non exclusive criteria include: 1. Professional medical opinion or another non -medical opinion. 2. Is the Professional medical opinion based on 1 or more doctors; the degree of opposing opinions and general consensus. 3. The strength of the supporting facts of the opinion such as case studies; Clinical Trial Phase; Type and numbers I respectively ask that before commenting that you read this entire text and links if needed. Familiarize yourself with a limited basic idea of the discussion and not go too far off topic. __________________________________________________________________________ Introduction I created this discussion based on my observation of the MELD-Na calculator when entering my sodium blood serum results after 1 week of treatment. I guess i have developed a "hobby" of playing with them to see various outcomes suggested. Background technical information if needed _____________________________________________________________________________ http://hepatitisc.uw.edu/browse/all/core-concepts 2.4 Evaluation an d Staging of Liver Fibrosis 2.5 Evaluation and Prognosis of Patients with Cirrhosis Importance of Distinguishing Compensated versus Decompensated Cirrhosis: Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score (CTP): Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) (especially have a layman's understanding) History and Background Used to predict what patients should be listed and in what order for liver transplant. The higher the MELD score; the lower the 3-month survival Calculation of MELD Score Limitations Clinical Use NOTE: Some of the core concepts have been updated at different times and may not reflect the current situation. __________________________________________________________________________________ The Meld calculators The Meld calculators can be varied updated and may have have different additional criteria including Na results and/or other including algorithms. http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/model-end-stage-liver-disease The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. Mayo Clinic researchers published the original MELD model in 2001. Refinements have been developed since then. These models are for use by medical professionals. The MELD Model The MELD-Na Model The MELD Model; UNOS modification There are more but mainly looking at MELD vs MELD-Na Model Another hosted by The Bologna Liver Oncology Group (BLOG) University of Bologna - ITALY in italian but can be google translated but you should be able to guess what input is needed. This auto show the results for different MELD calculators all at once. http://www.livercancer.eu/calculators.html NOTE this show two including Na with different results and have been unable to find out much yet about the differences One other one http://gihep.com/calculators/hepatology/meld-na/ _______________________________________________________________________________ Discussion with my guesses included and/or lack of specific knowledge unless confirmed by medical source. 1. The basic and updated MELD calculators use On Dialysis :Yes/No ; Minimum values must be 1 Creatinine 1.0 or less mg/dL is 1;0 Total Bilirubin :1 or less mg/dL is 1.0 INR 1.0 or less ratio is 1.0 because figures less than 1.0 because the natural logarithm of 1 is 0 and a value less than 1 would yield a negative value. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample; raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical system used. No units are used 2. The lowest possible score is 6 usually mean just over 1% chance of dying in the next 3 months. So who does this apply to with HCV? a) Not to those with confirmed F2\F3 or lower without any reason or test to confirm F4? b) MELD would apply to F4 Class B or C c) What about F3/F4 well compensated? The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically. and Ascites Grade 1: mild; only visible on ultrasound and CT it is possible to miss these. Either a less recent test; a doctor without the treatment experience/knowledge of cirrhosis/hepatology and/or a patient not mentioning very mild symptoms that seem chronic (don't want to be seen as weak or a complainer) could be reasons. 3.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am praying that someone will be able to help me. I am a 32 year old female that was diagnosed with Type diabetes at age 15. I have been on insulin from then and for the last 4 or 5 years I have been on a pump. My HBA1C Levels have been good so I have no issues with my diabetes as far as I am concerned. I was diagnosed with Poly CysticOvarian Syndrome...I have never had normal periods and I have always had to deal with acne. In order to conceive my first two kids I did like 5 cycles of Clomid with each. All pregnancy's were normal. About 5 years ago; I just started with shortness of breath. It felt as though an elephant was sitting on my chest and I couldn't get the deep breath in. In order to get a deep breath in I would have to try and force a yawn and after several attempts at forcing the yawn I might get lucky as to drawing the breath in. I have been to the emergency room on numerous occasions and because my pulse ox was always 99 they would basically dismiss me. I also have most relief lying flat on my back with my arms extended so I feel like I am opening up my rib cage. When I lay on my side I can barely breathe because it is like my rib cage is collapsing and can't expand to get air in. They have tried me on advair or singular and stuff like that because they said I have asthma (diagnosis which I still don't believe) but it doesn't work or help me out. I was referred to the cardiologist and was told I have Mitrial Valve Prolapse...(Which till today I still don't believe that diagnosis) and was put on lopressa but the medication would drop my blood pressure so low that I couldn't stand up. So that medication was stopped. After that they told me I was mental and had anxiety (zoloft; adavant and the one people always get high on); in which I think they told me that because they didn't know what was going on. I am always tired and the things I use to do its kinda hard to do them anymore because I just have no drive; stamina or energy to follow through. The only other medicine I was on in addition to my insulin was the birth control pills and my doc decided that I should stop them; but I got pregnant that very month...considering I had PolyCysticOvarianSyndrome and paid to have my first two kids; I guess that was a blessing. I had another baby and she just turned 2. I am now on Mirena which is a kind of IUD. My hair is also brittle and combs out no matter how much I do treatments for it. Over the last few months I have started with balance problems in addition to the shortness of breath. What would happen is when I get up I would have the "almost" blackout effect as I would call it; its like I am so disoriented that I just have to hold on; it is not the roller coaster feeling that comes with vertigo but it lasts for about 30-40 seconds and I just have to catch myself so I don't fall. This has started happening more frequently; when I bend down to wash my face and get back up or bending over to brush my teeth or even just closing my eyes; I sway all over the place. Its like shutting off an electrical breaker and cutting it back on quickly; so there is like a glitch in the system which cause just a temporary loss of power and then it resumes where it left off. I also get the dots of flashing lights when this happens and it honestly is just a bad feeling of the constant rocking and swaying motion. I went to my doc for my pap smear a few weeks ago and I told him what was going on and he was like noooooo this is not normal. They referred me to the Cleveland Clinic over there in Florida. (I am from the islands so medical facilities/ resources aren't the best). When I went there I had a neurology consult and a cardiology consult. They did a brain mri and a few other tests. One of them showed that the pressure in my ears was abnormal and the doctor told me to do therapy to "train my brain" to deal with the swaying.....at which I asked him if I was to just live with it? His response was basically yes. I was like but I have not lived with this all my life; and I understand the concept of developing a disease and treating it but I know the cause of my diabetes; my pancreas stopped working. BUT to tell me that I just need to accept it and live with it is unacceptable because we still don't know what is causing it. I went up to International patients department who scheduled all my appointments etc and busted out crying and requested a second opinion. He gave me 12.5mg a day of hydroclorothiazide a day and although it has help the swaying some the medicine makes the shortness of breath a little harder to deal with because when I take in the breaths it causes the area around my heart; the bone included to hurt. I am trying taking the medicine every other day because it is a capsule and honestly I don't think it is helping effectively. International Patients sent me to the ENThroat doctor and he recommended some other balance tests etc including a tilt table test but everyone seems to be missing something because I feel all of the symptoms I am having are tied together. It has been 5 years now that I have been dealing with this and it is taking a serious toll on me. As it stands all my symptoms are: Rocking and swaying blurry vision on and off- one day I can see clearly and others its blurry lack of energy no stamina shortness of breath sharp pains when drawing a deep breath decreased libido hair breakage blacking out with out actually blacking out and I usually have a minty feeling within my head; somewhat tingly Medications I am on: Novolg insulin in the pump- no more than 45 unites per day that includes basal and bolus doses. Roaccutane- 20mg a day to clear up the acne finally- I have been on it for the last 7months and the only side effect was dry lips. Mirena- inserted in 2009- has a 5 year duration Hydrochlorothiazide- 12.5 mg every other day I have just finished my roaccutane treatment and this is the first time since I was about 14 that my skin has been clear. Confirmed Diagnosis: Diabetic-Type 1 PolyCysticOvarian Syndrome RESULTS from Cleveland Clinic Tests: MRI BRAIN and IAC's without and with gadolinium- Their impressions were: 1. No enhancing lesions post gadolinium. 2. Mildly prominent cisterna magna. Slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricals. 3. Non specific UBO's in the white matter with the largest being about 4-5mm in the medial left temporal lobe. This could represent demyelination; vasculitis; migraine; a normal varient or ischemic change. 4. No evidence of mass or enhancing lesion involving the IAC's on either side. 5. Left maxillary sinusitis with hypertrophy of the turbinates. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Electrocochleography ECoG: Their impression: 1. Today's results are most consistent with the normal transmission time through the lower auditory system in both ears; there is no electrophysiological evidence of the VIII nerve or pontine level auditory pathway lesions. 2. ECoG examination was ABNORMAL in both ears; presenting electropsysiological evidence of increased labyrinthine pressure in BOTH ears. TESTS they have recommended which are not scheduled until the middle of September: 1. Audiogram and eng 2. Tilt Table test I know this was long winded...but any help/input would be GREATLY appreciated. Any recommendations for tests; the type doctor to go to; anyone who has experienced this type thing; anyone who knows of anyone who has experienced this type thing......JUST HELP PLEASE.,2011,2011,,

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Not sure where to post this; but here goes. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis/proctitis at age 13; but I'm certain now it's been UC all along. For 12 yrs they tried all kinds of things - cortizone enemas & prednisone; etc - but nothing helped. Finally referred to a gastroenterologist in 1980 who said there were some "new studies" that indicated that colitis might be caused by an imbalance in the bacterial environment of the intestine. From the little I've read here so far; that seems to have held true. It also held true for me. My Dr suggested that I add Metamucil to my diet 3 times a day and for the 1st time in 12 yrs the bleeding stopped. I discovered flare ups came after eating pork - I've since decided it's the preservatives in pork (and lunchmeats) that I react to. By avoiding those foods; and using Metamucil for the odd flare-up; I've managed to keep my illness in check for 30 yrs. Until now . . . About a month ago I flared up. This is the 1st time Metamucil hasn't worked. AMs are worst but I'm sometimes up in the night; too. The frequency is much more than ever before; and I've actually had a couple of major accidents when I couldn't get to the washroom in time. The Metamucil has helped some - for the most part once the AM has passed; I manage most of the rest of the day without having to run to the washroom at a moment's notice. But I'm alarmed that Metamucil is not helping the way it always has before. I should mention that I am currently living where I have no health benefits. It's not that I couldn't see a Dr; but we'd have to pay cash and we really don't have the $$. And Drs here are very keen on surgery for this type of illness - I know of a half dozen people who've had the surgery - my daughter's 15 yr old bf among them; and his Dr refused to even consider alternatives. So I'm reluctant to subject myself to Drs. I was encouraged to read that the use of probiotics and such still seems to be used. I guess I'm looking for some suggestions for additional options to help me get this under control again. Thanks to all.,2010,2010,,Female

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have suffered from disabling migraines for over ten years and have recently been diagnosed with complicated migraine syndrome.

Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I am a 54 yr old female from Australia. I have had 2 blood tests(Liver Function) several weeks apart which showed mildly elevated ALP - 126 and 132; and also my platelet levels were not right (I did not get the reading). I requested the clotting tests because I was bruising easily on my hands and arms; small purple bruises from simple bumps. I have had a dull ache in the right upper side of my abdomen; just beneath and also under the rib; also some muscle? pain in the back in that area (I put it down to muscular as it usually appears after physical work). This has happened occasionally over some 20 years; and which I have described as an echo of gall bladder pain (I had mine removed in 1980). Sometimes it feels like a cross between that pain and ulcer pain. 3 nights ago I had a severe bout of pain which lasted several hours. I have had duodenal ulcers in the past as well as reflux; and I have been taking famotidine 40mg daily for many years. I have been on medication for hypertension for 2 years now; and recently had the dosage raised - telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. I have been taking piperazine oestrone sulphate(oestrogen) 2.5 mg for 4 years (for hot flushes) and fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg for many years (for Excema and itchy skin). I am presently 85 kg in weight; having recently lost 8 kg. I used to walk for at least 30 minutes of a morning; but after a prolonged period of suspected bursitis was diagnosed with a torn gluteal tendon which requires surgery to fix. I have been taking 2 Vioxx (rofecoxib 12.5 mg)anti inflammatories daily for 14 months. My lifestyle is really busy; we run a small business and are active in many industry associations; also travel frequently; hence my reluctance to have surgery which will require complete rest for several months. I feel like I am falling apart physically. Consequently on a recent trip to the USA I purchased some Tylenol PM to help me sleep at night (it hurts to lie on my leg); and have been taking 2 every night for 6 weeks. My GP sent me for a CT abdomen scan this morning; but I am unable to swallow the mixture; so I did not have the scan. I have difficulty swallowing even cough mixture. I do also have haemorrhoids which bleed a little; and sometimes pass mucous; but eat unprocessed bran every morning with porridge to stay regular. My questions are - do you think I could have the pain and elevated tests because of the drugs I have been taking; especially the Tylenol? Could the elevated ALP readings be from lack of sleep(I read that somewhere)? Would those symptoms on their own be any indication of liver or other GI problems? Is the bruising a symptom of any GI problem or possibly an age thing? I would have thought I was not old enough. Is it possible to have investigative tests without having to swallow mixtures? - I have avoided suggested colonoscopies and barium enemas at various times over the past few years; I seriously cannot swallow the mixture,2003,2003,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,A week ago I had a Tia. I was unable to speak and could not move my left arm or leg. This went on for about an hour and 15 mins. After a night in the hospital; and an Mri and other scans. I was released. I was told I should have no side effects. But now I have bad head aches on my left temple and I get a stabbing pain on my temple and neck; that last that last just several seconds. Also my speach has been effected slightly. Often I will be talking and a word will pop in a sentence where it doesnt belong; and I forget just what I want to say. Could you tell me how long these symptons last? Thank you jjjtll,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have muscle spasm in or around the ribs on both sides (in the front under the breast and sometimes in the back at the same horizontal position); it feels like a ball rolling; in that it switches sides. It occurs even at night during sleep; painful enough to wake me. I only know that when I relax and stretch (the side where the knot is) using several positions I have to wait till it goes away; in many cases to have it return in other places described above. What does it mean; how do I treat it. I have high blood pressure and the meds deplete my potassium so I take a prescription supplement for that. What should I be asking my doctor.,2007,2007,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement. Anyone with any help or suggestions I would REALLY appreciate it.,2008,2008,,
Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was really hoping for a suggestion as to why I may have developed an indentation in the top of my head. At first I thought I was crazy; and that it was impossible for that to happen; but over the last few months it seems to have grown and now anyone who feels the top of my head can easily feel it. It scares me; especially since my husband had brain surgery less than 2 years ago- (symptoms completely different of course) I am 35 years old; the only time I remember hitting my head really hard is when I was in elementary school and I fell and hit my head on a tile floor. I have had a history of passing out and having seizures but the doctors never figured out for sure what caused it and it hasn't happened for a few years. The best they came up with was blood sugar; and dehydration as a cause for those episodes; although I never had a MRI or anything of my head. I don't get pains from it; it may be a little tender if I press on the indent kind of hard. Is there any condition that would cause my skull to cave in? please help!,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Am I to stay on Atenolol for the rest of my life? I have been on it for about 8 years now. Is it really necessary to take it everyday? I was diagnosed with a swollen left ventricule and a slight heart murmur.,2011,2011,54,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been on Atenolol for about 5 years for High BP. Over the past 6 months my feet have become extremely cold; My Dr said it could be the Atenolol. He checked my cirulation and did blood test everything was normal. He weened me off from 25mg; to 12.5 a day to 12.5 every other day to now off. Has anyway gone through this? How long will it take for my feet to feel normal if the Atenolo caused it?,2012,2012,50,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Mother is 83 and on numerous medications. Her heart dr. has discontinued the atenolol for her high blood pressure since she is also on revatio (new term for viagra) and he feels this should control her pressure. He also states the atenolol is contributing to her excessive tummy extension and extreme swelling of her feet even though she is on furosemide for water retension. This is the first we have heard of atenolol contributing to water retension. Please give us your opinion. Thank you; Concerned Daughter,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks in advance for your answer. History: 53;non smoker;no drugs non drinker. About 2 months ago became aware of increased amount of PACs and PVCs. Had them since childhood but only a few to non a day. Holter and other tests led cardio to diagnos as benign. Had less than 1000 PACs per day and less than 50 PVCs. They started to increase from 1-2 an hour and within a week to the present 1 every minute which was my reason to seek medical attention. The doc started me on a low dose of atenolol due to moderate hypertension and the palps. 25mg a day but it knocked my heart rate to 42-50 and pressure at peak to 85/55. The dose was reduced to half of a 25mg x 3 times a day which kept the pressure at a more constant 115/75 or there abouts. The palpitations also are milder but not much less in number. Question #1: I have been on the atenolol now for 4 weeks and now there is trace blood in the urine as well as hematospermia. Urologist thinks its not due to the atenolol but to a prostatitis and is giving me Levaquin 500mg once a day for it. Have been on it one week but the hematospermia persists and the urine test still shows trace of blood. Can the blood in urine be from the blood from the hematospermia. I know that your not a urologist but could still tie things together. Question #2: I've read posts that indicate that having these PAC's and PVC's will someday lead to a-fib of varying seriousness. Is this true and is it always the case or rarely? It seems as if one thing after another. Always been healthy now 4 things in a row. Are they tied together. Thanks,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,if lisinopril and cozaar aren't working to lower bp in combo with atenolol and hctz; in fact either causes higher bp and not feeling well; what is another possible choice,2014,2014,,
Atenolol+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 53-year old female who is not overweight. My blood pressure has always been good; usually 112-120 over 66-72. Two months ago; I suffered a severe headache that literally dropped me to my knees. I was outside talking to a neighbor; bent down and straightened up and my head started hurting; in the area a baseball cap would fit; and wouldn't quit. My husband and neighbor had to carry me into the house. I was taken to the hospital; my blood pressure was quite high (due to the pain; I'm guessing). They did a CT and found nothing. Two weeks later; my head started to hurt; I checked my blood pressure (I'm a nurse and was at work); my BP was 179/119. I went to Urgent Care; but was sent to ER instead; where they did an MRI/MRA of my brain. My blood pressure was 204/120. They gave me Atenolol; and after my BP came back down into the safe range they released me. The results of my MRI came back normal; but my MRA was abnormal. Apparently I am missing the A1 segment on the right; however; I am still getting sufficient blood flow to the brain. The ER doctor called me and said it is probably something I was born with; and doubts it presents a problem; but still wants me to see a neurologist (which I am doing end of the month). My blood pressure is still high; I check it three times a day and yesterday it was 165/102; 159/102 and 154/85. The day before that: 153/90; 124/84;157/94. This morning I took it after I got up; and before coffee; it was 143/100. I should mention that I have been taking Atenolol 50mg q.d. Prior to that the ER had me taking Clonidine twice a day; but only gave me a two prescription. My BP still ran high. I'm just wondering if high cholesterol could be the cause? or part of it? I have no idea what it is currently; but two years ago it ok. My PCP hasn't suggested having it checked; but am wondering if that might not be a good idea? I am not taking any medications; either prescribed or over the counter; except the Atenolol. I am somewhat concerned; especially since this seems to have come on so suddenly. I would appreciate any thoughts you might have. And when is a BP reading considered to be in the danger zone?? Thanks.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 23 year old female with a long history of hypertension. I was first diagnosed when I was about 8 when my doctor saw on a visit that my blood pressure was within stroke range. I had been on atenolol (50mg) for years until I hit some hard times and could not pay. I went back onto atenalol last year in october because of constant pressure on my chest and a particular episode where I had sudden chest pain; felt like someone sitting on my chest and numbness in arms/feeling like ice in veins. I was stupid and didn't go to the hospital right away but I was smart enough to go to a clinic and get me my medicine again. I have been taking my medicine and I have lowered my sodium intake as well as attempting to lose weight. I have PCOS which causes insulin resistance making it very hard to lose weight but with my metformin it's been slowly going down. Yesterday at work I suddenly developed a new kind of palpitation. It felt like a flutter at first and then like banging from inside my chest. The beats were irregular with no pattern and very fast. I felt disorented and dizzy and went to the break room. Several other coworkers tried to help me as I was unsure as if I should go to the hospital. One could clearly feel my pulse just by placing her hand on my shoulder. I could feel the blood surging from my chest above my right brest up into the side of my neck feeling almost frothy. I was shaking and even now most of what happened seems foggy. It calmed down after ten minutes and after taking it easy sitting down to work my head cleared. Even still I feel a bruised achy feeling in my chest almost like a cold feeling. I can't sleep because I can feel my pulse and the ache in my chest. It's not sharp or getting worse but just feels like the after affects of someone hitting me. Could this be something new or is my hypertension needing addressed further? What could this event have been?,2010,2010,23,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I've been taking Lisinopril 40mg; and crazy dizziness and headaches occurred and brought my blood pressure down to around 90/50; so my doctor had me take only 20mg lisinopril per day. With 20mg; my blood pressure was constantly at 160-170/100. Then; the doctor told me to take Atenolol 25mg at night and lisinopril 20mg in the morning. It brought my blood pressure down to around 100/60 regularly; but recently it started going up again. I often have electric tingling/weakness in my hands/arms/legs and feel like I will faint. Blood pressure fluctuates from 160/100 to 100/60 from one day to another. Doctor thinks I have panic attack and should take Xanax for it. But; I feel like the medication combination (atenolol/lisinopril) is giving me hard time. I asked doctor to please change the medication but he refuses; and he thinks it's the anxiety attack that's the cause for all this. What should I do? Is Lisinopril/Atenolol a proven combination to help hypertension? Thanks.,2010,2010,49,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I've taken Atenolol for 5 years......started 25 mg one per day hypertention for three years and then 25 mg twice per day for 2.5 years. My cardio doctor wanted to take me off of the atenolol because my pulse is around 45....he had me take 25 mg once per day for three weeks and then for 4 days take .5 of the 25 mg tablet once per day. I took my last dose yesterday. Does this sound correct? What effect will this have on my feeling if any? Is it ok to continue to work out cardio ?,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Long story short. Diastolic murmur due to dilated aorta; 4.5 cm. no aneurysm or dissection; also hypertrophy of septum at top margin with potential occlusion of maitral valve. On atenolol for a month to reduce contractility and rate in attempt to decrease septal hypertrophy. I'm a long distance cyclist and notice that my exercise tolerance has decreased and having slow progress building new muscle when doing pushups; etc. Question ; is atenolol the best choice for this condition? I am asymptomatic except murmur. Stress test showed no arrhythmias; BP and pulse in expected range. Are there other meds; Does Yerba Matte defeat the purpose of atenolol? What the heck do I do to feel strong again?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Atenolol is taken to reduce the heart rate when suffering from High Blood Pressure/Hypertension - therefore whilst on this medication does it mean that the person has to work much harder when exercising to raise the heart rate to burn calories?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 74 yr old female; very active; moderate weight. I've been treated for hypertension for over 10 years; trying various meds with limited success. Have been on Atenolol 100 mg; Hydroclorothiazide 25 mg; Losartian100 mg and Amlodopine 5 mg for several years now. Over the past 4 years I have had episodes of feeling unwell for an hour or so and eventually fainting. After a full workup I was told that no cause was found other than perhaps I become dehydrated causing my BP to drop to very low levels i.e. Labile Hypertension. My BP seems to normally run around 135 to 145 / 78 to 85. Checking it when I am starting to get the 'unwell' feeling I find it has dropped to 103/71. I realize that this is a 'good' reading but I definitely don't feel well when it is this low. Yesterday it was in the low range all day but went back to 'normal' at bed time.

Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor and has suggested a short term disability (90 days) from work to determine if stress is actually the root cause and to see if being away will lower the pressure. As well; although no kidney problems have been shown; he is also referring me to a kidney specialist for an additionial consultation to determine if he can see anything else that may be causing this issue. At this time; I feel I am getting excellent care; however; I am very concerned that these elevated levels will trigger a stroke. I would appreciate your comments on any other plausible medicial condition which you may feel might be the cause and your feedback on the short term disability aspect.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 34 yr old woman. I have 2 children. I am 5'6" and weigh 135 lbs. (so; within normal limits) I have a history of smoking. I quit 7 months ago. I had pregnancy induced hypertension at the end of my first pregnancy which resolved at the birth of my child. I also had hypertension immediately following the birth of my 2nd child that resolved in a couple of weeks. A few months ago I had two episodes of hypertension while at work 177/112 and 160/100. I was working a night shift both times and had drank an energy drink. Both episodes the elevated BP was accompanied by a headache and lasted several hours. I visited my Dr. following these episodes and she thought it was the energy drink causing the high BP. Since then I quit drinking energy drinks and even quit drinking caffeine regularly. ( I now have no more than one caffeinated beverage a week). Since then I have checked my blood pressure periodically and it is usually around 120/78. Two nights ago I was walking around the house and felt my heart skipping around. I have felt palpitations before; but they always went away right away. I continued to feel these palpitations so went in to the ER. EKG showed Premature Junctional Contractions. Dr. stated that these were harmless. Blood work all came back negative. But; BP was elevated between 150/100; 165/121; and 180/111. I was given Toprol 25mg; which I have taken daily since. My blood pressure has normalized; but the heart palpitations continue now more than 36 hrs later. My question is What will cause sudden onset of heart palpitations? and What would cause intermittant high BP? I did not feel anxious; and would anxiety cause BP to elevate that high?,2010,2010,33,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm presently on atenolol 40 mg (along with hydrochlorothiazide) once daily. I will be transitioning to propanolol 20 mg (and hydrochlorothiazide) twice daily soon - my doctor wants me to transition by taking propanolol - 1/2 of 20 mg twice a day for one week and then the full 20 mg twice daily. Why? Won't that cause rebound hypertension? Thanks.,2013,2013,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you. Had an ECG 1/05; also one 11/04 when admitted to hospital with SOB and low BP. Also pulmonary function test in 12/04. Would appreciate knowing what it all means. Please explain the difference between the two ECGs and conclusion given on the PFT. Have omitted normal results. I take CCB+325mg aspirin daily since Dec; previously Atenolol 25mg. 1/05 ECG: Mitral valve thickened w/o restriction. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation Right ventricle mildly dilated. Mild right ventricular hypertrophy. Right atrium mildly dilated Tricuspid valve thickened w/o restriction. Mild (1+) tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 55 mmHg No pericardial effusion or intracardiac shunts IMPRESSION: Moderate mitral regurgitation Mild tricuspid regurgitation Mildly dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle Moderate pulmonary hypertension 11/04 ECG: Mild mitral regurgitation. Mitral valve appears anatomically normal. Right atrium: normal Tricuspid valve: trace tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary artery pressure is 68 mmHg. Moderate pulmonary hypertension 12/04 PFT Mild restrictive ventilatory defect. Question if this is related to her body habitus/obesity (noted height of 64 inches and 134 pounds). Also noteworthy: diagnosis given for complete PFT - pulmonary hypertension - question findings related to same. Clinical correlation is suggested. Abnormal at rest arterial blood gas and pH determination with evidence of moderate hypoxemia. PaO2 was 26 mmHg less than that calculated for her age & position. MBT,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My husband is taking Novasc 10 mg; Atenotol (not sure of dosage) and a durietic 50 plus synthryoid. He is 57 and is quite active. He ihas gained weight. His blood pressure is around 117/74 to 134/84. He is losing his hair; his short term memory is terrible. He can ask the same questions over and over. He is pre-diabetes and we are trying to control it with diet. He seems to be in denial and doesn't want me to come to the doctor with him. He didn't have prediabetes before -we just found out. He has many other apparent side affects but won't admit to them. His doctor seems to think he is OK on these meds. I'm concerend about the meds. Can you tell me if the combination of meds he is taking is dangerous or could be? His doctor told him he would probably have the same side affects with any hypertension meds. Is this true?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a delimma and am hoping someone could help me on this. I had a severe case of SVT in Feb'08 and was prescribed Atenolol 25 mg each day. I was taking Atenolol when I realised I was pregnant; the 1s day of my last period was 2nd March'08. I stopped taking Atenolol on 4th April. My doctor is advising me to go for a termination of pregnancy as this medicine could have serious effects on the foetus. But I don't want to do that as I feel the actual exposure to foetus is really very small to worry about. Any advise is appreciated. Thanks;,2008,2008,36,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Taking Sotalol for AFIB and it is not effective. How does one change from 120mg BID of Sotalol to Atenolol @ 50mg BID? Is there a need to taper the Sotalol?,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi I've been on beta blockers for the last 10 years primarily for hypertension initially caused by anxiety. Up until 12 months ago I was on Propranolol 80 mg daily this was then changed to Atenolol 25 mg daily with a view to stopping using. Basically my anxiety returned and I bottled out of stopping them. However fast fwd a year and I have been experiencing ectopic heart beats quite often when exercising so being worried about these back to the docs I went. I under went a 24 hour ecg and results showed the ectopic beats and Bradycardia down to 36bpm at times. As such I have been told I need to come off the Atenolol which I have been doing for the last 5days by chopping tablets in half which I have been told to do for the next two weeks then stop. I was just wondering what I should be feeling heart rate wise as the pills wear off I already seem t have a much more reactive heart rate to exercise even something as simple as climbing stairs increases the heart rate. I am quite fit and regularly cycle and walk for an hour each per day. It is just ever since my anxiety episodes even though ten years ago as soon as I feel my heart rate I go into panic mode.,2007,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,A year ago at the age of 44 I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and prescribed 25mg Atenolol daily. I was 40-50lbs overweight and in the past year have returned to competetive cycling to help weight management. I'm now riding 40 - 50 mile training rides and about 100 miles weekly but find I've got to a level where no amount of extra training improves my performance; particularly on hills. Cyclists of the same age are often faster. Similarly when using a heart rate monitor I can't seem to get my heart rate above 140bpm whatever I do; whether in the gym or on the bike. I assume this is an effect of the drug. Also I don't get out of breath when training as much as I used to. Does this mean the drug prevents me from working anywhere near my anaerobic threshold? Will no amount of training alow me to improve so long as I keep taking Atenolol? As my level of fitness is greatly improved compared to when I began taking the Atenolol and my weight reduced (by over 30lbs) and bearing in mind the low 25mg daily dose is it logical that if I stopped the medication the higher intensity training I might undertake would benefit my condition?,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Two quick questions: is there a difference between high blood pressure and hypertension (I noticed there are 2 different topics listed here) Also; I began taking 12.5mg of atenolol 2x/day - it's only my second day; so in total I took 3 pills. I noticed a feeling of calm come over me; however; I was told it might make me sleepy. I had the opposite reaction. As soon as I took it; I developed a metallic taste in my mouth; my arms started to hurt (second dose it was okay); but I feel like I have dry mouth (not totally but it almost feels like a swollen tongue). I drank some more but it doesn't really help. The odd thing was that it immediately curbed my appetite. The first day I ate nothing after I took the pill and only started feeling hungry when it was wearing off in time for the night pill. I felt spacey all day from not eating (like low blood sugar) but I had no appetite whatsoever. When I took the night pill; I was up the whole night. It's almost like a shot of adrenaline. It is worrying me. I took my morning pill and the same thing happen. My appetite was gone in no time; and when I had to drive in the afternoon to get my daughter from school; I was so spaced it out it was scary. I thought maybe my pressure dropped. The first day the reading shot up to 1 79/112 (I'm usally 150's/100's); and then stayed high most of the day; but today it seemed to have dropped to mid 120's or so. I went out tonight and didnt' take the pill; and yet i was still soaring with adrenaline (I still can't sleep and it 's 4am); the metallic taste is there and that swelling of the tongue. so bizarre. my daughter was like "mom; go to bed; how are you still awake and hyper." My bp was 179/100's - not good - probably because i missed tonight's dosage. But I'm scared to take it again. I took a xanax .25mg to try and sleep. Any help would be appreciated. I'm seeing my dr on monday.. This is the first bp med that worked a bit for me; as the calcium channel blockers (norvasc and plendil which caused vomiting) gave me suicidal (that's what they called them) cluster headaches and elevated my bp to 250/135. I'm scared that if i missed the night dose i might have a stroke (i read that on one of the boards if u suddenly stop taking bp meds you could have a stroke). I have a blockage in my renal artery (one dr said it is thick on one side but clear on the other; also the renal doppler showed a bruit ad significant restriction of blood flow; the MRI showed it as well.....but not conclusively. I'm getting very frustrated with it all. I've tried natural remedies; lsost weight and yet nothing. So atenolol is my last resort. Thanks!,2008,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I have been given a prescription of Atenolol to treat my arrhythmia. Since the package insert for the drug does not list arrhythmia as one of its indications; I would like to know if this is a common AND effective use of Atenolol. Thank you.,1999,1999,,

Atenolol+hypertension,History: 36 y/o male with hypertension BP 150/110 My internist perscribed 50mg Atenolol 4 weeks ago. After 1 dose; my HR dropped to about 40-45. The dosage was reduced to 12.5 mg and since my BP has been normal (120/70). However; I still have periods of low HR (40-45). I am a runnner (although not much in the past 10 months); but do not know what my resting HR was prior to starting Atenolol. The side effect in the first few days were fatigue; etc. However; in the past week or so; I've had ringing in my ears and a "jittery" feeling that seems to be getting worse. This prevents me from sleeping at times and when I am able to sleep; wake up during the night with these feelings. I take the medication just before I go to sleep. My doctor thinks these symptoms could be caused by anxiety and has perscribed Lexapro. He has suggested I take this for a week and then switch my BP medicine to Lisinopril due to the Bradycardia. My question is: could the ringing and "jittery" sensation be caused from the Bradycardia as opposed anxiety or a side-effect of the Atenolol?,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi! Anybody know how high is "too high" of a heartrate when on 100 mg atenolol a day? I am on the atenolol for borderline hypertension and mostly because of benign palpitations. Have had all the tests over the years...palps diagnosed as stress related. I dont get much exercise...but I do take 6 flights of stairs DOWN every day at work. ( no..I havent mastered going UP yet!) I am very overweight; have been for several years now; so trying to take it slow. Am 46 years old. My normal pulse at rest is between 58-65. I take my pulse when I get to my car after taking the stairs down; and usually it doesnt jump much---is around 95-100 immediatly after the stairs. It goes down to a normal rate really quick--usually within a few minutes... (1-4). THe past couple days Ive taken the stairs down; and feel quite winded--and pulse was 113 on Friday. Thats higher than its been. Long question; but bottom line; what is "too high" while being on that dose of atenolol? I know I cant calculate my maximum exercise heartrate like other people can; because of the atenolol..,2007,2008,,Female

Atenolol+hypertension,My husband is 57 and has sleep apnea; pre-diabetes; hypothyroidism and hypertension. He takes Norvasc; a diuretic; Atenolol; and Synthroid. He is having a lot of side affects like; short term memory loss that he denies; he is losing his hair; weight gain (he is very active man) and seems emotionally unstable. Are these due to the medications? I am concerned that the calcium blocker beta blocker combination is dangerous. Can he get full blown diabetes from the atenolol? He won't let me come to the doctor with him so I am in the dark with this. He doctor is young - aboiut 33 yrs and I am concerned he isn't experienced enough. I don't understand why he is in such denial. I asked his doctor if he is in any danger of dying and he assured me he wasn't. Could you tell me if this combination of meds are common? thank you.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,O.K. I had been debating whether to post my question here because I feel that is is very complex; or at least the lead up to it is. To make a very long story as short as I can; I was very healthy up until I was 22 years old. I am now 24 years old. When I was 21 my father was killed by a drunk driver and this sent me into a depression; although I never went to a doctor or took any medication for it. When I was 22 I graduated from college and took a full-time job as an operations manager; working days and nights alike; at least 70 hours per week. In January of 2007; one month before my 24th birthday; I experienced what I can only describe as a panick attack. I was riding in the passenger seat with my boss; when all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint. I then felt my hands and feet get numb and felt a big pressure in my chest. I asked him to please drive me to the hospital cuz I felt something was really wrong with me. When I arrived at the hospital; I got even more scared and began to have trouble breathing. They brought out the EKG machine to the waiting room and said all was normal. The doctor said that all the blood work and EKG were fine; but that he wanted to keep me over night for tests. Over night; I received three more EKG's; chest X-Ray's; a CT-scan (where they inject a yellow colored iodine to map your arteries); and the whole time I was hooked up to a little box that was monitoring my heart for the entire 24 hours. In less than 18 hours they cleared me to go home with no restrictions. Over the next two weeks of out-patient visits; my Internal medicine doctor noticed that my blood pressure was consistently high; with an average of 145-150/90-95. He put me on Atenolol 25-mg and on Xanax as needed for the anxiety; that he diagnosed as GAD. Well; my blood pressure improved to an average of about 130/80-85 or so; which he felt was satisfactory so he asked to not see me for another 3-4 months. However; during this time I experience another 2 "panick attacks" with similar symptoms to the ones mentioned above. Needless to say; I went for a second opinion with a Family Practitioner; whom assured me that my heart was fine based on the hospital results; but he added a 10-mg dose of Enalapril to go with the 25-mg of Atenolol because his goal was to get my blood pressure to an a systolic reading less than 120 and a diastolic reading of less than 80 on a consistent basis. He also took me off of Xanax and put me on Lexapro 10-mg. In addition; he asked me to exercise more and lose some weight. I did everything he told me and the results were great. My blood pressure now is an average of maximum 120 systolic over 78 diastolic. I run 2.5 miles at least 3-4 times per week; and although my diet isn't the best; I greatly cut back on my consumption of sodium; saturated fat; and caffeine. Now; today I went in to another doctor in my hometown b/c I had strep throat and he was schocked to see that a 24-year old man is on Atenolol. He said that I should immidiatly go see a cardiologist; b/c he suspects that I am on Atenolol b/c there is something wrong with my heart. This scared me more than I can explain. Neither of my parents have any history of heart disease; heart attack; or stroke. Neither do my grandparents. My mom has hypertension as does my maternal grandmother. When my dad passed away at the age of 59 his only ailment was high cholesterol. My question is this: 1.) Was his assumption that there is probably something wrong with my heart accurate; because I am on atenolol? 2.) What kind of a future do I have to look forward to as a 24-yeard old man with hypertension? I know my message is very long but any help you could provide me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!!! God Bless....,2007,2007,24,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Has Atenolol been superseded by more modern and more effective drugs?,2011,2011,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather "sloppy" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms? Should I reduce it more slowly...over weeks or even months?,2011,2011,43,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I was recently diagnosed with Graves' disease. My blood pressure has consistently been high. The systolic reading has generally been between 140 to 160 and the diastolic reading is always below 80. I have been prescribed atenolol to relieve my symptoms and my blood pressure has come down some. Less than six months ago; I monitored my blood pressure daily and I always had normal readings. So my question is: Due to the fact that my blood pressure was normal so recently; is it more likely than not that the recent increase in blood pressure is a result of my hyperthyroid?,2010,2010,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was put on hctz 12.5 mg around 2006; but knowing I have severe "white coat syndrome"; I never took it until I tore some muscles in my upper back and the Dr. insisted I start the med. in May of 07. I have a B/P monitor which checks out against the ones at the Dr.s office; so I was pretty sure my home readings were accurate and they were OK. I was in a great deal of pain from my back injury and PT was making it worse. My personal trainer suggested a med that had helped with a back problem; and my physician sent in a perscription for it. After one dose; I ended up in the ER in the middle of the night with outrageously high B/P. They got that fixed; but it went way up again the next day and I saw another MD who immediately put me on 12.5 mg Atenolol. That was in July of 07. I am 5'2" tall; weigh 116# and have no cholesterol problems or any other (known) medical problems that simple blood tests would uncover. While on Atenolol I got very out of breath on my daily walks and ; being a SCUBA diver; I had a very scary out of breath episode under water that made me decide to try to get off the Beta blocker. My current MD had me take my regular dose every other day for a week and then stop. The first week after stopping; my energy level was off the charts; but this past week there has been a lot of heart-pounding; rapid heartbeats; soaring B/P from time to time; a rushing sound in my ears that makes me think my B/P is way up and my fears just make it much worse. She said I might have to double up on the hctz if there was a Beta blocker backlash; but I really want to stop those; too. Is there any hope for that and is there anything I can do to help myself through this? I don't smoke; I seldom drink and never more than 1 glass of red wine or 1-2 beers. I exercise regularly; and have cut salt out of my life as much as possible and take vitamins regularly along with cutting out red meat. There is a strong family history of heart problems which none of my Dr's seem to address - most don't even get up from the computer to listen to my heart. I am going on a dive trip in March and I don't want to feel this rotten while out of the country. A little advise would be much appreciated. By the way; I am a 69 yr.old female.

Atenolol+hypertension,I would like to know the long term effects associated with Atenolol and Procardia for a child who has been taking these medications since the age of 4 and who is now 8. I know that his hypertension will never go away so he will more than likely take these medications for the rest of his life. Does anyone have any information?,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everybody. I would like to have some hypertension success stories. It is important to me - to know that anyone did this! Please... Please; write HOW did you succeed with your hypertension.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it. I also have an rx for Ativan; but the atenolol makes me pretty mellow; so I don't see using that at all. Anyone have similar profiles or conditions? Anyone know of any interractions to any of these meds with atenolol? My pharm and doc say no; but just doublechecking. Thanks.,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am taking 25 mg of atenolol at night for hypertension along with .2mg of clonidine. I just started taking the atenolol two months ago and it knocks me out. The Dr just increased it to 50mg. I took it and my husband had the hardest time waking me up. When I finally did come around I felt disconnected. The kind of feeling you get when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the restroom and you lay back down and you're out as soon as your head huts the pillow. Anyone else take this medication and experiencing similar symptoms?,2013,2013,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I was disqualified from a job process due to this medical condition called left ventricular hypertrophy. I take benazepril & amlodipine besylate for high blood pressure;and for migraines atenolol. I didn't know they were also used for heart problems. Is this condition treatable or cureable?,2009,2011,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I have been having rapid heart beat and 12;000 PVCs a day for the past 2 years; since giving birth to my daughter. My question is whether or not I should take 25 mg of Atenolol twice a day. My primary care doc says I need to take it; but I've been told by a cardiac doc that my PVCs are benign. So; is taking the beta-blocker just to make me feel better? Or will it actually benefit my body somehow? I have taken it before; and it does help lower my heart rate and frequency of PVCs. Thanks!,2009,2009,33,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,The beta-blockers and CCBs groups of medication are usually subscibed for me to adjust fast heart beat AND lower hepertension. Are these medications suitable for a person with a normal blood pressure most of the time? are there any alternative medications that regulate the high pulse WITHOUT affecting BP?,2008,2008,57,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system? I don't eat red meat or pork and I eat lots of veggies so other than diet; are there alternatives that could help me reduce my BP that I may not be aware of (other than exercise; which I do 7-days a week) and a low sodium diet?,2011,2011,42,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 32 years old male. I have high blood pressure for last 10 years and I am taking Atenlol 50mg for last 6 years. I started running marathons in 2008 and since then I have completed 4 marathons with an average time of 3:40:00. I consulted my doctor and he said its good idea for my health to keep this routine; although Atenlol might be a hindrance in exercise. Personally; I feel quite relaxed after each training run and even marathons. During exercise session my heart rate is always less than 150 bpm while its 40-45 bpm at rest state. I didn't had this problem earlier but now-a-days I feel quite over-breathed in first 30 minutes of the run but it stabilizes after that. I also have the tendency to gain weight very easily. My question here is: - Is it a good idea to run marathons with my disease and prescribed medication? - If yes; then why do I feel over-breathed recently and why do I gain the weight within a week time if I stop exercising ? - I also want to increase my marathon time; but it seems the pace of 5 mins/km is the limit for me. Does Atenlol is really limiting my speed. Thanks in advance for the advice.,2011,2011,30,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hepatologist suggested my doctor put me on something to control Esophageal Varices; which after a test; were discovered in me. The severity is said to be medium. I've don’t some reading with contradicting beliefs from various doctors and clinical trials. However; all doctors seem to agree that a beta blocker like Atenolol is necessary for a long term use. Just want to know if any of you are on this treatment at 25mg per day. I understand there are some risks; but that the result of lowering blood pressure and heartbeats can help reduce the development of a more serious Varices problem; which in some cases can cause death form unstoppable internal bleeding. Anyone? Thanks; Magnum,2001,2008,61,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor; as I am employed in a high stress job with a major financial company and has recommended a short trem disability to determine if being away will cause the BP to go down.Although I am not adverse to this; I would apprecaite any additional plausable medical issue that may be root cause. My situation is being closely monitored and I do feel I am getting good care/treatment;however; I am concerned that this could lead to something bigger ie; a stroke if I can not get this under control. One of the issues I have also dealt with along with this is a rapid heart beat and beta blockers were increased to assist with this problem. Given the secondary hypertension and the heart beat I am somewhat concerned. Could the heart beat issue cause this BP as opposed to a stress related issue.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65. I am a 41 y/o white male 167lbs. Thanks for any advice or expeience. Andy,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. (1) Could you please quote if possible the success rate for PVC ablations at the CCF; also the complication rate for this procedure? (2) At what stage is a PVC ablation recommended or does it depends symptoms associated with frequency? (3) Any new information on why one can go for months or years without any significant amount of PVC and then they flare up at the rate of thouasnds a day for weeks to months on end before subsiding. Could some autoimmune disorder or connective inflammatory disease be a trigger? I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis and this is the pattern with my PVCs flare up; just curious; I haven't had any in over 2 and half years. (4) I take Cozaar 50mg daily and atenolol (atenolol) 100mg daily in divided doses; 25mg 4 times daily; I find it more effective in helping the palpitations that way; my internist agrees with this approach. I read an article recently; can't site the article right now of some negative studies regarding atenolol and treating high blood pressure; would this apply to its effect on palpitations also; Have you all seen the article or information on this information or study? Any opinions if so? Thanks for your valuable time and service.,2001,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Can a severe isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation result in pulmonary hypertension? When I had my first echo a year ago my PA pressures were in the 30s. Last May my mitral valve was replaced; maize procedure done and PPM implanted as a result of sinus node dysfunction. I had right heart failure after surgery that has persisted and become worse. An echo last summer showed severe regurg of TV and PA pressures of 42. Symptoms are now more severe so a stress echo was done last week. PA pressures at rest were 48 and with activity 69 and pulse ox drop to 85. A walking pulse ox went from 98 to 88. IVC and right atrium was very large. I will be having a right heart cath next week to confirm the functional data. I do understand why PA pressures would increase with MV regurg but since it was not up initially please explain to me why it would be up now with the isolated TV regurg issue. Physiologically; I just don't understand that. Would a repair of the tricuspid valve fix this problem? I have seen a surgeon but he has been reluctant to go back in; first surgery was 8 months ago. I have had reoccuring atrial flutter (cardioverted 5 times in eight months; on amiodarone) with a failed ablation attempt secondary to the nature of the tricuspid valve. So an intraoperative ablation has been proposed if they elect to repair the valve. I am young and healthy for the most part though I did have thyroid cancer with a radical neck and parathyroidectomy which complicates taking diuretics. In spite of all of this; I continue to work full time though it is becoming more difficult.,2003,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation for as long as I can remember and take Atenolol daily. I had an ECHO last week and was surprised and confused by the results. I was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and I had mild tricuspid regurgitation along with a mild RV enlargement and mild pulmonary hypertension. The cardiologist did not seem too concerned. He said my numbers were just barely over the normal ranges. My RV dimension was 2.5 cm and my RVSP was 37mmHg. Should I be getting a second opinion? Is this high pressure due to my mitral regurgitation? I am so concerned and was so overwelhmed and feel I did not get all my answers. I would appreciate any advice or commets. Thanks!,2014,2014,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 47 years old; diagnosed with hypertension--155/105 at the doctor. Doctor gave me a choice of atenolol or norvasc. I took atenolol because my BP flies up when I'm nervous; and I've recently been bothered by the sensation of a pounding; although not racing; pulse in neck and ears. I began with only a 25mg dose each day...stragely enough one of the side effects even at this low dose; was an increase in my urine output. Doctor said he'd never heard of it--yet when I checked the bag from the pharmacy; it said to report "exceesive urination." I didn't knw what was meant by "excessive;" which is why I called the doctor. Now he wants me on Nifedical XR; starting with 30 mg..I would have tried to stay with the atenolol if someone could havetold me the reason for more urine output; and that it was not a dangerous side effect...I can't even find reference to it on the web as a side effect--ANYONE with helpful advice or similar experience? (I actually felt much more relaxed on the atenolol--I tend to get anxious when things are bothering me; and I felt much better),2008,2008,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have had hypertension for a while; which I've tried to control with diet and exercise (walking). Those efforts were not successful as I was unable to maintain a diet and exercise program over time. I'm quite overweight. My bp at my last doctor's visit was 160/100; and a week before; at the doctor's; it was 140/100. I have always had fairly good bp; until this past year. I'm 55. Hypertension runs in my family - now; 4 of 5 of us have it; as does my mother. My doctor declined to give me a diuretic; as I have a cystocele (a hernia of sorts in the bladder wall; which makes it bulge into the vagina; causing difficulties urinating at times) although we discussed that possibility. He chose to give me Atenolol; 25 mg. once a day instead; without a diuretic. He - and the pharmacist - assured me it's well tolerated; for the most part; a mild drug; and so on. I have been doing lots of reading on the internet; and also; of the monograph provided with the medicine. I am reading about side effects such as dizziness; shortness of breath; all kinds of awful things. I have dizziness due to vertigo (believed by my Dr. to be due to fluid in ears / virus); and wonder how I'll be able to tell whether any diziness is a side effect or the vertigo. It's all very new and confusing to me. I seek input from any doctors on this forum about how folks do using this drug; as a rule; and whether I should ask for a diuretic instead (I know you can't be that specific as you don't know me). I have no other medical issues that I know of; other than being quite overweight and having a pituitary tumor that was being reated with cabergoline. I also have cut my salt back to 2;000 mg. or less; and try to walk most days; at least a mile. I want to lose weight and increase my exercising; but read about how folks' heart rates slow down; etc. Can someone provide some info that will help me adjust to this medication and/or things to look out for? Thank you. Anna,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Can you please expand on the so-called "J" Curve; and the newly released INVEST study that suggests that lowering Diastolic too much can actually cause a cardiac event. I have read that INVEST and also the JNC study says that at levels below 85 mm; the risk of a cardiac event can increase. Am I reading these reports incorrectly? I hope so; because with my hypertension under control; my Diastolic is averiging in the 60's.....is that good(as I thought); or Bad? Thanks,2003,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I run about 3 miles a day on the treadmill (usually 3 miles in 30 mins). I'm taking 25mg of Atenolol 2x a day for pvcs and mild hypertension (my blood pressure varies between 125/80-140/80 but has gone higher on occasion- I also suffer from mild MVP and occassional panic attacks) I'm 33 yrs old; 6ft; 168pds. Otherwise healthy. My question is when I finish running on the treadmill my heart rate is usually only about 90 after three miles at a reasonably fast pace. I'm not that winded; but my legs hurt. I recently started running again to hopefully reduce my blood pressure and get off the atenolol. Shouldn't my heart rate be in the 140 zone in order to get full cardio benefit? Is this the Atenolol that's affecting my exercise rate? What's the point in running if I can't get my heart rate up? I'm positive the Atenolol effects my resting rate because before I started taking it it was 60 and now it's usually around 45.Any suggestions to maximize my cardio workout while taking Atenolol? I'm too young to be letting this drug interfere with my life. I'd rather be off it. Though the doctor pescribed it mainly for the pvcs and occasional tachycardia due to the panic attacks. Thankyou for you're help. You all work very hard and it is much appreciated!,1999,1999,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ellen on August 06; 1998 at 11:57:47: Hello; I just read an earlier message about not discontinuing atenolol abruptly. I have breathing trouble and chest pain; the cause of which has yet to be diagnosed. I was put on atenolol when I complained that my heart rate seemed to go up when I would stand up (I have "reduced cardiovagal function"). The atenolol helped that. However; the breathing problem and chest pain continue. Well; I have a new pulmonary doctor and he suggested stopping the atenolol. He said that can sometimes cause make breathing worse. Also; he has retested me to see if I have reactive airways; which now it seems I do test positive for. Now I'm taking meds for that for a few weeks to see if it helps at all. I was taking atenolol 50 mg once a day. The pulm. told me to take 1/2 pill for a few days and then stop. He told me if I start feeling bad to start taking it again. I took 1/2 pill for 3 days; then stopped. Began to feel aware of the heartbeat again. It's faster; too. I guess I was excited about the thought that I'd get rid of the atenolol (I always wondered whether I really needed it all all - I can endure a fast; pounding heart as long as I know it's not dangerous. No one ever suggested it was dangerous.) I'm thinking that without the atenolol; maybe the airways meds will have a chance to work better. But have I perhaps discontinued the atenolol too abruptly? Should I talk to my internal medicine doctor about it? Should I be monitored in any way; now that I'm not taking the atenolol? I've just moved to a new city and have a new round of doctors; with whom I am very pleased so far. I've been trying to get a diagnosis for my breathing problem for so long now; and finally I'm getting a truly fresh look; starting from scratch. So; I don't want to ruffle feathers by asking one doctor about the other doctor's instructions about the atenolol; unless I truly need to. If I do ask; how should I approach it? You can probably gather that I tend to walk on eggshells around my new doctors as my naturally assertive manner has not enamored too many of my former doctors to me!! But if I shouldn't let these questions slide and this is important to be following up on; I won't be doing anyone a favor by being quiet. In case it's important to know; I also take Norvasc for hypertension 10 mg/day. Thank you for any suggestions; Ellen,1999,1995,,

Thank you for any suggestions; Ellen -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Ellen; Topic Area: Heart Disease There is no exact science to stopping beta blockers (such as atenolol). Stopping them abruptly can cause "rebound tachycardia" that is a increase in the heart rate. For most people this rise in heart rate is not dangerous. I think that the method your doctor gave you for stopping the medication is fine. If you want to extend it you could take a quarter table for an additional 3 days. Don,1999,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hey all- 21 year old male here who stared 25mg Atenolol for high blood pressure and anxiety 4 days ago.

My BP has ranged from 140/95 to 160/95. About 8 mos. ago; out of the blue; my heart rate soared to about 125 at rest for about 5 minutes. I had been experiencing some difficulty breathing and tightness in my chest after climbing stairs or a 40 - 50 minute walk. I went to my GP and my BP was 180/110. He put me on 50 mg Atenolol. I experienced heavy fatigue/exhaustion. He reduced the prescription to 25 mg. after 3 mos. my bp was 160/100. I had a subsequent experience of heart racing to about 125 at rest which lasted about 3 hrs.; with extreme anxiety/perspiration. Two weeks ago I went back to my GP for a checkup. My bp was 180/100. We discussed my contining chest tightness after walking or stair climbing. He sent me to a cardiologist. Yesterday I went for my visit. He took my vitals (180/100)ran an EKG; discussed family history and my history. He concluded that I have "some" coronary heart disease and probable angina. We scheduled a Thalium stress test for next week and a chloresterol screening so that he could determine the extensiveness of the problem and put me on a program for improvement. Now my questions: What is the difference between a treadmill test and a thalium treadmill stress test? What does "some" coronary heart disease mean? What questions do I need to be asking?

I experienced heavy fatigue/exhaustion. He reduced the prescription to 25 mg. after 3 mos. my bp was 160/100. I had a subsequent experience of heart racing to about 125 at rest which lasted about 3 hrs.; with extreme anxiety/perspiration. Two weeks ago I went back to my GP for a checkup. My bp was 180/100. We discussed my contining chest tightness after walking or stair climbing. He sent me to a cardiologist. Yesterday I went for my visit. He took my vitals (180/100)ran an EKG; discussed family history and my history. He concluded that I have "some" coronary heart disease and probable angina. We scheduled a Thalium stress test for next week and a chloresterol screening so that he could determine the extensiveness of the problem and put me on a program for improvement. Now my questions: What is the difference between a treadmill test and a thalium treadmill stress test? What does "some" coronary heart disease mean? What questions do I need to be asking? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - MTR on May 26; 1999 at 14:20:54 Dear Colin; thank you for your question. From the information you've provided; I'm worried that you may have coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is also called atherosclerosis and causes blockages to form in the coronary arteries. These blockages can limit blood flow to the coronary arteries to cause chest pain during periods of stress (exercise or high blood pressure). A family history of premature CAD in relatives younger than 55 years old; diabetes; high blood pressure; smoking; and high cholesterol levels all contribute to the development of CAD. Your BP is too high and needs to be aggressively lowered to around 130/80. Your cholesterol levels should also be checked and high levels should be treated. An ECG treadmill stress test is the standard version of a stress test where you exercise on a treadmill while your BP; heart rate; and ECG are continuously recorded. A thallium stress test goes one step further by imaging blood flow to your heart with a radioisotope called thallium during an ECG stress test. A thallium stress test is more accurate than a routine ECG stress test. After you receive your thallium results; you should ask your cardiologist about further procedures that may be indicated; how your BP will be treated; and whether you need to take a cholesterol lowering medication. I hope you find this information useful. Information provided in the heart forum is for general purposes only. Only your physician can provide specific diagnoses and therapies.

Atenolol+hypertension,Because I was having some problems with "Atenolol" after taking it for about one year (hot flashes; difficulty with achieving and maintaining an erection; drowsines); my Doctor switched me to "Cardura". She explained to me that it was an Alpha-blocker but explained little else. I had been on 100mg of Atenolol. She is now easing me off of the Atenolol. I am taking 75mg for three days; 50mg for three days; and 25mg for three days; after which I will be done with the Atenolol. Today is the first day that I am on 50mg's and I have also taken my first dose of Cardura (2mg). It caused me to become short of breath; tired; made me irritable; and gave me a headache. Is this because I am taking the combination of the two drugs? Is this a reaction to the Cardura? If so; is there another Beta-blocker that might not have the side effects of Atenolol? I have also read that blood count must be monitored when taking Cardura. She said nothing about this. Should I mention it to her?,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF CARDIO MD-APS on March 26; 1999 at 18:10:27: In Reply to: atenolol question posted by Jay on March 24; 1999 at 10:42:00: Im on 50 mg. atenolol at night. Also take Nubain ( nalbuphine hydrochloride ) for sleep/headaches; and am on testosterone therapy. My blood pressure has stayed the same ( 132/84 in the morning; 150-170/86-105 in the evening ); but my heart rate ( resting ) has dropped from 84 to 60 in a month or so so I suppose it is working. Can you see any possible interactions with my meds? I asked my Doc and he says no but for some reason I dont think he was listening. Thank you. Jay Dear Jay; There are always potential drug interactions in any person on multiple medications; and it really is patient dependent since it is the individuals liver and kidney that break down and excrete the drug. There might be some concern that the testosterone therapy is causing the elevation in blood pressure (levels above 140/80 are generally unacceptable; i.e. represent hypertension.) Don't know much about Nubain (not a drug we use in cardiology very much.) It really is an individual thing; i.e. what drug combination is best and safest for you; in order for you to be safe; if the same physician is not prescribing all three medications; they each need to be aware of what other medications you are on in order to assess what is the right drug for you. Atenolol is one of those drugs that has few if any interactions and I agree it is working if you resting heart rate is 60bpm. To check yourself; go to a medical library or just ask your doctor to let you see the PDR; physician's desk reference and look up under Nubain; the section called drug interactions. Your local CVS or Rite Aid pharmacist would also be able to discuss such potential interactions with you. I hope this information is useful.

Atenolol+hypertension,My mom is 80 years old with a history of coronary artery disease; high cholesterol and hypertension. 12 years ago she underwent a CABG x3. She had a recent angiogram and the graffs are in good condition. Her hypertension over the last year has gotten worse. currently her bp runs around 178/76. She is currently on 50mg Atenolol and 160mg of Diovan and her bp is still not therapeutic. I should also add that she is unable to tolerate an ACE. She has been on the ARB for 2 months and it has made her very tired and weak. I am a nurse and have experience with hypertensive drugs. I would like to see her off the Atenolol and on 80 or less Diovan; Norvasc and a diuretic. Is there any reason why she should remain on the Atenolol? When I spoke to her MD about the Norvasc he thought it was a good idea. Jokingly; I said; "her next complaint will be swelling in her legs." he said; "I'll just add a diuretic." I know that a diuretic will not reduce the swelling in the lower extremidies caused by Norvasc. It concerned me that he diddn't... What would be a good combination of drugs for her given her history?,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By chris on March 14; 1999 at 14:27:00: I joined a fitness program last November. Because of my age (48; female) I had to have an exercise stress test done on the treadmill. I take 25 mg atenolol daily for episodes of moderate hypertension. The technician continued the test until my heartrate was at 140. He was surprised that I could go that high without any symptoms. He gave me a target heart rate of 120-140. The evaluation gave me a cardiovascular rating of "very good to excellent". I find that when I exercise I have no problems at all until I get my heart rate up to 120. At that point it seems that I can only exercise for about 10 minutes; making me wonder if the treadmill test wasn't run long enough. After about 10 minutes I have to cool down or I become short of breath and nauseated. I told my doctor about this and he said that the dose of atenolol I was taking was very small. I should just not exercise as hard. My question is; shouldn't a person who has an overall cardiovascular rating of "very good to excellent" be able to exercise longer than 10 minutes at the lower end of her target heart rate? Could this be an effect of the atenolol? Can I expect to see an improvement if I keep working at it? Thank you.,1999,1995,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Had 6xCABG and dual chamber pacemaker in 1997. Developed AFib 2001. Treated with amiodarone after failed ablation. Generator replaced 2004. Developed amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis and liver inflammation 4-08. D/C Amiodarone; treated several months with high dose prednisone and 200mg atenolol for hyperthyroidism and AF. On 7-08 underwent catheter ablation for AFib. Worked well for 1 month. 80mg Betapace bid used after cardioversion 9-08. AFib no longer a factor. Taking warfirin and betapace af only at this point. Pacemaker generator replaced 10-08 and blood pressure gradually increased to 150/95 five days afterward until present. Previous pressures were consistently 110/70. Pacemaker pulse is set on 80 bpm. Colchicine was taken for 3 days just after generator change. Also have tinnitis with hypertension. So far; no relief with 50 mg atenolol bid and 80 mg betapace AF bid. What caused the blood pressure change? The new generator or setting; colchicine; betapace; prolonged high dose prednisone or luck?,2008,2008,59,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it. I also have an rx for Ativan; but the atenolol makes me pretty mellow; so I don't see using that at all. Anyone have similar profiles or conditions? Anyone know of any interractions to any of these meds with atenolol? My pharm and doc say no; but just doublechecking. Thanks.,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation for as long as I can remember and have routine echos and take Atenolol daily. I have not had an echo in several years and been having some chest pain for the last couple months. I had an echo this week and was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and also had some mild tricuspid regurgitation. RV was mild enlarged and pressure was 37mmHg so mild pulmonary hypertension. I was overwehlmed with all this news. My cardiologist did not seem to concerned said my 2.5 cm right ventricle was slightly out of normal range and the 37mmHG was just over. Should I be concerned and get a second opinion? Also what is causing this high pressure? Is the mitral regurgitation causing this? I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!,2014,2014,,Female

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all! I am a 22 year old college student...200 lbs and 8% bodyfat; great shape etc. I eat a nearly flawless diet and low sodium; all that jazz. Despite this; my BP has always been around 140-150/70!!! I get extremely nervous during tests and when they check my BP. In the office my BP was 175/80..a new record! My PCP put me on 50mg atenolol..claiming that my hypertension is anxiety based since I'm such a nervous person. I HATE ATENOLOL!! I used to be a great athlete..but I can't run good at all now! Also my heart rate was 60..now it's 40!! I felt dead..so I now take only 25 mg. This still makes me feel sluggish...I feel so old at only 22. HERE IS MY THEORY! When I'm not nervous- my BP has always been great (125/70). Unfortunately; I'm nervous all the time. I also get depressed and have no idea why..it's been messing with my relationships for years. In someone like me...a beta blocker makes me feel awful and more depressed..PLUS I can't workout! Going to see a new doc...and I really think I could control my pressure with an ACE-I and then an SSRI to control my anxiety. BTW I'm going to med school next year...so I'm about to get A LOT more stressed! I appreciate the help...should I switch to ACE-I + SSRI? I know a lot of docs use SSRI's to deal with stress; I figure a low dose might help me since I seem to have general anxiety very badly,2009,2009,,Male

If you have failed medical treatment (and it sounds as if you have); then surgery should be considered. There are laparoscopic procedures fundoplication procedures to treat esophageal reflux. Before; committing to surgery; it is necessary to document the degree of reflux and to exclude esophageal motility disorders that may worsen with fundoplication. An esophageal motility study with 24 hr pH probe study should determine the potential benefits and risks of fundoplication. You should be aware that excessive obesity is a relative contraindication to a laparoscopic procedure. This information is presented for educational purposes only. Always consult your personal physician for specific medical questions. HFHSM.D.-rf *keywords: esophageal reflux 0.3,1998,1998,,

Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. How does medicine help control high blood pressure? For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Doctor and Poster: What is NSAIDS?

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 14 year old girl and was diagnosed yesterday with left ventricular hypertrophy caused by my hypertension. The cause for my hypertension is unknown. I don't exercise but Im fit and normal weight. I keep a low-slt diet. I am not being treated with atenolol 25 mg twice a day. So my question is that how quickly does the ventricualr hypertrophy usually progress? When I saw my cardiologist iN january i did not have it and in a 6-month period it developed. I also have mitral valve regurgitation and diagnosed with arrthmias.,2009,2009,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi All! I have hypertension and since a few months ago I started to feel a lack of air. Once I have finished my main meals; my breath gets more dificult. I'm not an obese person; just a little overweighted; I also have GAD (generic anxiety disorder) and I take Losartan; Paxil; Xanax and Atenolol. Cause; by the way; I get tachycardia at some point of the afternoon mostly after eating also. I don't know if this is normal or not; but I think not; cause the lack of air is notable. Some advices will be well accepted; I'm worried that this could be something bad. Blessings,2009,2010,37,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,My mother has hypertension; and had a triple bypass last year. She takes atenolol and pravastatin. She used to take lasix; but it causes her blood pressure to increase by 30 points. Even otc diuretics like midol do the same thing. I know diuretics are common for this condition; and I have not read about this happening to other people. Is there another type of diuretic that would not have the same effect?,2010,2011,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently bought a blood pressure cuff to use at home as my blood pressure varies and I have occasional panic attacks. I am on 50mg of Atenolol (1/2 morning; 1/2 evening) and .5 mg Clonazepam 2x a day. I run 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I have noticed that my heart rate is usually around 42-45 during the day and my hands are always cold; especially in cold temperatures. I assume this is due to the Atenolol; but am not crazy about this side effect. My question is this: My blood pressure is usually around 135/80 when I measure it first thing in the morning. At night when I get home from work it's usually 122/73. Is everyone's Blood pressure higher in the morning? Also somtimes my blood pressure will be higher- around 142/88. Should I be concerned? I am a 33yr old male; 6ft; 160 pounds; and in fairly good shape. I have a slight heart murmer and slight leakage of the mitral valves; but my cardiologist said nothing to be concerned about. How much does Atenolol reduce blood pressure? Shouldn't mine be lower with the Atenolol if I'm healthy? I would like to lower my dosage if possible with my doctors supervision; but am worried this may increase my blood pressure. My doctor says I am taking Atenolol for Atrial Tachacardia- usually brought on by panic attacks - and not for hypertension. Before taking the Atenolol I was told my blood pressure was relatively normal-though sometimes high due to white-coat hypertension.Neither of my parents have high blood pressure; or heart problems. Can you answer any of these questions? Also when I am measuring my BP The first beat I hear Is the Systolic but for an accurate diastolic reading do I record the last audible beat even if it's very slight; or the last beat that's reasonably loud. I'm not quite sure which is more accurate.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My uric acid is 7 md/dl as at 10.6.08. It is just border line (7.2). Back in 2006; it was 5.5. My question:- 1. Why has the uric level increased so much? 2. I have been on Atenolol only 0.5 mg per day. Can this cause the uric acid to increase? 3. What foods should I avoid eating? 4. What foods to eat to reduce the uric acid? 5. Can Peanut butter causes high uric acid? The brand is Skippy. 6. Will uric acid causes a heart attack? Tq so much. Rgds; alanchong20,2008,2008,50,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,My 63-year-old mother; in overall good health; has been having a very low pulse rate. Sometimes; it has dropped to 39! The is the second time this has happened to her in the past 4 or 5 years. The first time; it was due to blood thinner medication. This time; the doctor's are not sure. She has been taking Atenolol for the past 3 years or so; and never had a problem. Her blood pressure was always borderline-high (ie...150/80). However; along with a very low pulse rate; the bottom number of her blood pressure reading has been in the 50's! Of course I am very concerned; but her blood work and EKG came out normal. She will be having a 3-day heart monitor in the near future. Any ideas what may be causing her very low pulse rate and blood pressure. Any suggestions on what specific tests she can do to find out about any problem(s)? Thank you. PS...She just had knee replacement surgery in September; 2007.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,HI! I have been on Verapamil; and gained weight from that. I was also on nadolol; but the heartbeat was still forceful. I asked to go on atenolol (10 mg in the AM and PM) since it helped my mom for the same thing. It is very noticeable and i have a hard time sleeping from this! I recently went to a health and nutrition store...as I read the good effects of Hawthorne Berry on the heart.. I took that; but not at the same time as atenolol. My heartbeat is worse then ever and sooooo strong and uncomfortable! I won't go off the heart meds until I can slowly cut down. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I should do? No insurance becasue of layoffs; so this is hard. Heart tests as of last fall (2008) were normal. THANKYOU!,2009,2009,53,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 57 year old man on 25 mgs. of Atenolol daily for 'white coat' hypertension; a few PVC's now and then and a possible small 'silent' heart attack sometime in my past. With the beta blocker; I take one baby aspirin per day. Also; I have a Left Bundle-Branch Block. After an echo-cardiogram; EKG's; 2 Thallium Stress Tests; my docs have okayed me for an exercise program run by the local hospital and staffed with a trainer and RN. My resting pulse now with the Atenolol is anywhere between 48 - 60; averaging about 55-57. My BP averages about 130/75 at rest. I am exercising 5 days a week; about one hour each day on various machines...attaining pulse rates of about 90-95. A few times I have managed to get to 105-110 for just a couple of minutes; but thought this might be too fast.

Atenolol+hypertension,I have been on 40 mg Pravachol for about 3 months after being switched from 20 mg Zocor due to insurance reasons. This is in addition to 25 mg Atenolol for mild MVP / hypertension. I have tolerated both for a few years (43 now) with no problems; except lately I am experiencing more noticable loss of libido and erectile dysfunction to a moderate degree. Could this be an effect of the meds. that has taken a while to occur? I am considering dropping to 20 mg Pravachol after seeing data that seems to indicate the benefits are nearly the same.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doctor; Five days ago I was diagnosed as having had an Interior Infarct. I am a 47 y.o. male; with a physically demanding occupation. The Doctor started me on Plavix 75mg; Lipitor 20mg and Atenolol 25mg (half a 50mg) all daily. I was previously taking Avapro + HCT to control hypertension. The Doctor advised me to continue taking the Avapro + HCT. Since being on all of these medications my pulse has been regulated from 150bpm to between 68bpm and 88bpm and is regular and strong. I have no chest pain. My blood pressure however has dropped from an average of 120/86 to a minimum of 95/56 and an average of 98/64 with a pulse rate averaging 76bpm. I feel light headed and quite weak; and this is at rest as I am not back at work yet. I suspect it could be the actions of the Atenolol and the Avapro+HCT together lowering my blood pressure too much. My question is; can I stop taking the Avapro + HCT and simply continue with the other medications to hopefully raise my blood pressure slightly without increasing the risk of another infarction or tachycardic episode? Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; My mother is 56 old. She is on Atenolol 25mg; Analetin 5mg(not sure of the spelling); and Zantac (She used to be on Nexuim). Within the last few month she is been having accelerating blood pressure in the evenings. Her pressure goes from 105/65 to 185/150 in minutes. It happens randomly 3-5 times a week usually between 6-10PM. Her pulse could anywhere from 65-95 during the attacks. Her doctor gave Clonidine to control the pressure during the attacks. The attacks have been increasing in frequency. She had CT scan of her kidneys and adrenal glands and they were clean. It is a mystery to us and her doctors. I am afraid if could a condition is getting worse everyday and could be too late by the time we find out the real condition. If anyone has come across such a condition or has any suggestions; we would appreciate your help.,2008,2008,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi everyone Is heat intolerance the last symptom to go away when treating hyperthyroidism? Could it be something else besides hyperthyroidism? About 3 years ago I developed uncontrollable hypertension and some tachycardia. Only atenolol (up to 200 mg/day) was able to control it; although making me very weak; sleepy and depressed. Then blood tests revealed it was all caused by T3 hyperthyroidism. 2/10/2015 Free T3 5.09 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) high Free T4 1.21pg/ml (0.93-1.7) normal TSH 2.67 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) normal Antimicrosomal antibodies 15.95 IU/ml (less than 34 IU is considered negative) Low testosterone is said to continue until I no longer use Atenolol or Propranolol. On physical examination the Endocrinologist said he felt the thyroid gland is enlarged. After 6 weeks on 20mg/day Tapazol (Methimazole) Free T3 4.79 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) still high but less than before Free T4 0.92pg/ml (0.93-1.7) borderline low TSH 5.09 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) high Blood pressure is now much better controlled; almost using no Atenolol. But heat intolerance got worse. Is this normal? The endocrinologist kept me on 20 mg/day; next blood test scheduled for 5/14/2015. Because of my former hypertension and tachycardia he wants my free T3 to get into normal range (to prevent a heart attack or stroke) despite what happens with TSH and Free T4. He said me might try lowering Tapazole dosage once Free T3 gets back to normal. Will heat intolerance go away once my free T3 gets into normal range? Why am I responding so slow to Methimazole? Might it be because only my free T3 was high so now my free T4 is now low; so little reverse T3 is formed.,2015,2015,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,I have a 46 yo male with no known cardiac risks factors other than stating he may have had hypertension in the past but unsure. No meds. Having chest pain and shortness of breath. EKG in ER was normal; chest xray normal; cardiac enzymes neg. Referred to us for a nuclear stress test and the patient was put on atenolol; ranexa; and imdur. However; non compliant with the imdur because of headaches. A 2 day protocol was used. The patient walked 11 minutes and reached 13.4 mets. 95% to his target heart rate. The patient was short of breath and had chest pain. The Ekg did not really show anything significant. The nuclear images were negative other than the RV showed up prominently on the stress study. An echo showed neg but had 3 small leaky valves. Why would the RV only show up on the Stress imaging. No lung uptake was seen. NO TID levels increased and no Lung heart ratio increase. My concern are we overlooking something.

Atenolol+hypertension,Healthy 150 lb age 61; shaken when I had 1st recorded AFib Nov ’07 (after dental surgery) causing me to go on 25 mg. Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a night of AFib episode ( I was urinating frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out. After the fainting; cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on blocker); I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16 two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark below 50 & record beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin; they were going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on before I was switched off to Lisinopril). Since going to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress; very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp. I still from time get a weird feeling in my head (like interference) and worry Memory is not as fast at retrieving…..maybe my magination. Very gratefull so far AFib seems to be in check….fingers crossed. My /optimistic ? If someone has a 6 - 12 month run of only 5-10 short mild Afib episodes; is getting off coumidin a possibility.Aside from bleeding I assume drug has side effects???aside from issue of metal in your chest; once implanted successfully does pacem presence effect morbidity for an otherwise healthy person?,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have mild MVP and had all the EKG's; Echo's; Holter and Event Monitor's galore. Always been told my heart is fine. When the MVP first started in my early 20's it was just Sinus Tachycardia. The older I have gotten the more PVC's have come ( I am 35). First it was ocassionally; now they are coming in a series and when they come one right after the other they feel more like flutters like it cant catch up and I feel nasueaous (not like the normal thud); but I have not felt faint at this point and it has shown my heartbeat to be irregular on blood pressure monitor but blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Once again told they were benign and my heart is fine. Put me on Atenolol 25 mg a day...told me I can increase if I need to; but it seems to me that this beta blocker makes me sleepy and depressed lowers my blood pressure and now I wonder if the slowing of the heart rate is not making my skips worse. Should I increase my atenolol; stop my atenolol or should I try Magnesium. I have heard alot of people say that Magnesium has helped them. If I do stop taking the atenolol I know you are not supposed to stop all together how should I wean myself off of it; again I take 25 mg a day...sometimes I even skip a day.,2007,2012,35,Female

Atenolol+hypertension,Had concerns about "funny" feeling once in a while; like skips or flutters in heart. Had been told on 2 most recent visits to Urgent Care for virus symptoms and then to quick check before cataract surgery by nurse that I had a heart murmur. I saw a cardiologist. He put me on 25MG Atenolol and after doing a Echo he added Diovan 80MG. My blood pressure has never run high--only put on Atenolol as my pulse rate on 1st check was 118. When I went for Echo a month later blood pressure was 125 over 85 and pulse rate was 58. No problems found with Echo---he can hear a very slight murmur but nothing to be concerned about. He wanted me to add 2nd med and come back in about 3 months. I asked about side effects and Dr. stated very little side effects. After seeing on bottle of Diovan that it may cause dizziness I checked on line & see it is for high blood pressure. I did not take this medication. My question today is how do I ween myself off the Atenolol? Would it be safe to just quit it or should this be handled in another way?,2011,2011,62,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I suffer from labile blood pressure.

My doctor wants to put me on beta blockers to help control my pressure and also to help my migraines. I have two questions that he did not know the answer to: 1) Will the beta blockers lower my "normal" blood pressure below what it already is?

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello: I'm a 48 y/o Caucasian male at 5'6" & 200 lbs; Dx'd w/ Paroxysmal A-Fib back in 12/06. No other medical issues except pre-hypertension (135/85) & high BMI. My PCP & cardiologist initially Rx'd weight loss; stimulant avoidance; Aspirin 325mg & Atenolol 25mg/day. All labs values were normal. 24-Hr. Holter showed NSR except for 1 palpitation x 2-3 minutes. Baseline echo results after meds started: Normal left ventricular function; Mild mitral regurgitation (advised SBE prophylaxis); Peak TR regurgitation velocity of 1.46 m/s & Peak RV systolic pressure 8.5 mmHg greater than RA pressure. This last reading - peak RV systolic pressure 8.5 mmHg > RA pressure - apparently is below the normal range of 20-30 mmHg. Can you tell me what could be the causes/implications of this low reading? My cardiologist said he would be more concerned if the readings were above the normal range. To date/14 months later; my A-F/palpitation episode freqency has increased. My cardiologist increased my Atenolol dosage to 25mg; 2x/day & felt another echo is not necessary at this time. If the AF frequency/duration increase further; then rhythm control meds could be considered. What are your thoughts on this plan? Thank you very much. Stan,2007,2008,,

Given her near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue any blood-thinning therapy? 2. Are there any no problematic drug interactions with her medications? We are particularly concerned with some of the Atonolol’s side effects (i.e.; the potential to develop type 2 diabetes; and unsteadiness when walking leading to more falls.) Are there safer; just as effective alternatives to Atonolol for her? We are also concerned with the elevated dosages of Lisinopril & Omeprazole. With these dosages; our mother’s systolic blood pressure has been in the lower end of below 120. Should the dosage be lowered; what should that be ? Thank you.,2009,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 40 years old and married. I do not smoke but I occasional drink. I have white coat hypertension.

Atenolol+hypertension,I've been on beta-blockers for 5 years. I'm 33 now. My doctor put my on beta-blockers for hypertension; and a fairly high heart rate. On the beta-blockers I may have developed Peyronie's Disease; so the doctor took me off of the beta-blockers last week. I was on atenolol 25mg; once a day. He told me to stop the beta-blocker cold turkey and take an ACE Inhibitor. The ACE Inhibitor is keeping the blood pressure normal; about 118/78. But the heart rate is 85 to 110 when sitting. Mostly it's 80 and 90's when sitting; but sometimes it hits 100 or more. The heart feels more rapid when up moving around and doing things. He told me to stop the atenolol right away; but I took 12.5 for 4 days; and now I haven't taken any for 3 days. Is this level of tachycardia dangerous?,2012,2013,,

(diastolic pressures have been in low to mid 90s). My son has LQTS; and we have all been checked for it; with negative results (testing was EKG). Six months ago I had a strange episode where I felt sudden chest pain/pressure with sweating which lasted approximately 10-15 minutes and slowly subsided. I had an EKG done a few days later which was within normal limits. Because of symptoms; a stress thalium test was done which was inconclusive. A cardiac cath was then performed; which did not show any blockages. So; it was decided to continue treating the hypertension with atenolol. I do not understand why I continue to have these strange heartbeat episodes; and if there might be something wrong. I am a 53 year old female in otherwise good health.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I had hypertension and was under medication for that. Then I had comprehensive cardio checkup in April 1998 at the age of 47. Since then; I have been undergoing comprehensive cardio checkup regularly following my doctor’s reporting of dilated aortic root and enlarged left ventricular ED. The following is the case history of checkups. Age Aortic root diameter Aortic / Pulmonary regurgitation Medication 47 4.2 Atenolol 25 mg; Amlodipin 5 mg 48 4.6 ;; ;; 50 4.7 ;; ;; 52 4.6 Gr – I/ nil ;; ;; 53 4.5 Gr – II/ nil ;; ;; 56 Gr – II/ nil ;; ;; 59 4.9 Gr – I/ Gr- II ;; ;; 60 4.9 Gr – II/ nil Atenolol 50mg+Amlodipin 5mg; Aspirin 75; Atorvastatin 10 Also I had CT Angio done which showed Aortic root diameter of 5.4 X 4.7 cm and partially calcified plaque lesions in proximal and mid segment of LAD (about 55% area stenosis). I have consulted both doctors; Cardio-Medical and Cardio-Surgeon who said that there was no medication for dilated aortic root and no hurry in getting surgery at this size. As per their advise I am taking three medications as mentioned. As I live alone at work without my family most of the time; I’m bit worried about it. The doctors did not prescribe ARB. Pl. provide your advise.,2012,2012,60,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,42 yr old woman...5 weeks pregnant...(this will be my 4th child) I have been taking atenolol for approx. 8 yrs. - prescribed to reduce "skipped heartbeats" which caused anxiety/panic attacks. When first given dose was 25mg each day. OB/GYN that I have scheduled an appointment with (have never been seen by him) said that ideally he would like me off the atenolol since it is not for hypertension. I have low blood pressure (averages 102/60 most of the time). I did see a cardiologist 4 yrs ago (holter/ekg/echo)..all good...some pvcs...but nothing unusual. Tried to stop the atenolol in the past...3/4 of a tablet for 1 week; 1/2 tab for a week; then 1/4 tab for a week. It went well but 6 weeks later the skipped beats came back; more flutters; feeling shaky afterward and of course anxiety about it all! Started the atenolol again (1/2 tab) and things settled down(this has been about the last 3 yrs). Stopped the atenolol 2 days ago and today I had episodes of skipped beats (10-20/hr)... don't get so panicky about it anymore since I visited an anxiety specialist (fyi; I never had an anxiety or panic attack until I had an episode of skipped beats and palpitations) Also had the stomach flu yesterday with a fever ( 99-100)! My questions... 1. Is there a good way to discontinue the atenolol? 2. Is discontinuation the better choice while pregnant? 3. Is there a better(safer) beta-blocker to use when pregnant? 4. The increased skipped beats could be the result of being sick and pregnant rather than my stopping the atenolol; right? 5. Should I request to re-visit the cardiologist when I see the OB/GYN so they are in sync? Thanks in advance for any guidance!,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'am a long time sufferer{17 years} of PVC's who's had all the non-invasive tests including a "normal" thallium stress test. With the basic understanding that at least some arrhythmias are caused by some type of cardiac problem such as CAD etc at what point does one request more invasive testing testing like cathierization{sp} to rule out blockage? I mean if I were to explore ablation shouldn't one positively rule out all root causes before a procedure like ablation is undertaken? Also I'll ask you to speculate; the docs on this forum have often stated that PVC's can be associated with hypertension or a result of it. Do you think this is because high BP in some way effects the heart to precipitate the PVC's or is it that the type of person who is prone to high BP {"type A"; etc} is also prone to PVC's? And why then when BP is controlled to normal levels do PVC's not stop? I realize these last couple of questions likely have no real answers just wondering what your intuition leads you to believe. AS always Doc thanx much for your time we all appreciate it Gaspipe,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; Im 27; 250lbs; 5'-11" and I work out about 5 days a week; mostly cardio jogging and Anaerobic sprinting. My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor or doing? Im really worried that my heart will stop or that I have an underlying issue. PLEASE HELP!,2008,2008,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39 year old female who has been suffereing from a racing heart rate for the last two years. Normal heart rate for me is about 120 to 130 upon any little exertion it jumps to 180 to 200 sometimes it feels like my heart is goig to pop right out of my neck it is so strong and the thumping becomes painful in my neck. My gp put me on atenolol; had stress test done and cardiologist said heart was strong didn't know what was causing heart to race; but it was definitely abnormal before we even started it was at 143. Said was not hypotensive and didnt believe I needed atenolol; went back to gp; said this is ridiculous was still have chest pain and heart was racing at 145; must slow it down he said. So I've been on atenolol now for 4 months;helps to some degree but has not gone away. Last couple months been experiencing numbness in left arm and quite a bit of chest pain. Rest makes it better. I have iron defieicency anemia hemoglobin is at 8.8 level for last 7 months. Is it possible that the anemia is causing this problem. Or if you have any ideas; could you please advise. Is my gp right in putting me back on atenolol when specialist said;no. And can this harm me in any way? thanks so much for your time. Any response would be a help. It all gets pretty confusing. One other thing I suffer from extreme fatigue; does this have anything to do with racing heart rate?,1999,2000,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 22 year old female; otherwise OK health. In Sept. I started to get spells of tachycardia and my left arm going very numb. I have had all the tests and all they can find is AR; MR; MVP and a small calcifaction on the aorts...(I know thats spelt wrong) I def. don't have a panic disorder; and the IST was on my holter monitor. The ESP doc said that sinus tach was ok...just ignore it. How can you ignore such a thing? I always have chest pain; besides the sinus tach. Oh I'm on 25mg of antentol. I was on 50mg and I couldn't get out of bed. So now they gave me 25mg. Would taking another 12.5 help? without making me sleepy? When I ask this question they say I don't know. I have been trying to post forever. I do hope you can shed some insight,2000,2000,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I am hypertensive and am on toprol; which works for both my PVCs and hypertension. Once every few days; my BP shoots up to 160/110 etc. for apparently no reason. Not even diuretics is able to bring it down quickly. This goes on for a couple of days; I have dizziness and am not able to raise or lower my head; and then it goes down. What can I do for this and what is the reason for this. Should I go on a second medication continuously to avoid this; or can I just take this extra medication when such episodes happen.

Atenolol+hypertension,For anybody on that med...I just went from taking Atenolol; 50 mg; 2 x a day for..oh geez 15 years at least; to taking the metoprolol. Same dosage..50 mg 2x. I was having LOTS of palps; and the dr felt that the Atenolol just wasnt working so much for me anymore. I started just this past Friday ( 07/24). I know the brochure I got with it; says it can take time to get into my system. But...one thing when I was on the Atenolol...my heartrate very very rarely EVER went out of the 60s. Even when I was active. Oh; sure; if I climbed stairs it would rise up; sometimes near 120 tops; but it fell right away too. I also never felt my heart beat; or pound a bit...EXCLUDING the times when I was having palpitations..of course I feel it then..but when Im just relaxing; I didnt feel it. ALSO...when on the Atenolol; i could even skip a dose..and my heartrate would stay down. Now..on this new med...gosh; if its even fairly close to the time that my next dose is due; and I; say; take a flight of stairs; or make a couple trips carrying heavy groceries; my heart is beating pretty fast. I timed it at 132 bpm; after I carried some groceries in ( its a rather long walk..heavy bags). I dont LIKE this new med; I dont think!! I want my HR to always be nice and low like it was on the Atenl!! But then; maybe im not giving it a chance? Its only been 4 days that ive been on it. I have a follow up appt with the Dr at the end of August..he wanted me to give this medicine about a month..then come and see him. Anybody out there ever go from Atenolol; to Metoprolol..and actually LIKE it?? Ever have this sensation of knowing when its wearing off? I hate that.,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 55 yo female scheduled for a dubutamine stress test next week and I'm pretty scared. I had an adeosine stress test several years ago but they couldn't get my heart rate up during that test and that test was awful! I felt like I was going to pass out. I don't know what will happen during this test. I have a problem with pvc's plus I'm a diabetic and moderately overweight and get SOB easily. Currently I take atenolol and varsarten for hypertension and the pvcs. I am terrified I will go into cardiac arrest or something will happen; my neighbor had this test and he told me his blood pressure went up to 250! (didn't say if systolic or what?)

Atenolol+hypertension,I am hypertensive female; obese ; enlarged heart; ocular pressure. My daughter who is 13 years old; is about 5'3" and weighs about 120 pounds; about the right weight for her height. When I measure d her BP with the digital BP monitor it was 108/69. What should the BP be for a young girl that age. Is this too high for a 13 year old girl. I have a lot of problems and I do not want her to get a high BP at such a young age. I'm finding it very difficult to get her to eat less starchy/ fatty foods. I would like to take your advice and show it to her. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi...I'm a 32 year old female 5'3 & 130 lbs. I've had to take Atenolol for about 8 months. I was put on this med when my BP skyrocketed to 175/118 (I was also sent to the hospital). I have no high BP in my family; weight is normal and I'm too young for this. My doctor attributed my high BP to the Effexor I was taking. I just switched to Wellbutrin and have read that this will also cause a rise in BP. Should I be worried about this? Or will the Atenolol keep working (it also helps with my anxiety). I just don't know what is better...go off the AD and be miserable or take the Atenolol and worry that I'll have a stroke one day.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi doc. Just need your opinion. I'm 27 yrs old male married. Had young hypertension since 2002. Took medication atenolol 50mg per day. Low risk person to infected by HIV. I've been positive ELISA on 27/11/2006; I only repeated my ELISA and done WB on 18/10/2007 (after 11 month; my doc so angry with me). The result came positive for ELISA and Indeterminate WB (only gp160 presence). After 3 weeks (9/11/2007) I repeated WB and done Viral Load. Then the results are WB still remains indeterminate as the first (only gp160 presence) and viral load is undetectable. My doc instructs me do some retest after 3 month. Can u describe my condition doc? TQ very much.,2007,2007,26,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,I am 42 year old male and having Hypertension since the age of 32. I have tried several Beta Blockers & ACE Inhibitors in the past 10 years. I used to change the medication every 2~3 years when they were found ineffective. Following is a list of medicines I have consumed in the order : Atenolol; Lisinopril; Enalapril & Bisoprolol. Recently when my BP was at a rate of 170/110; my doctor prescribed following medicines : Metpure XL 25 (Metoprolol 25Mg) & Arbitel-H (Telmisartan 40Mg). Now the BP at a controlled level.

Though I have been taking different medicines in the past; I never felt so lethargic. I can't run a 100 Mtrs or climb a hill.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi people; I have anxiety disorder and hypertension; this both diagnosed and treated. I have some control now with my panic attacks and extreme anxiety; but the problem is not that; I just tell you that just for you to know some priors; 3 days ago I started to experience some kind of numbness in my right hand fingers (the first 3 starting from the right). Not completely numb or non sensitive but some kind of strange numbness; the rare thing is that I've been having this sensation for the entire day. Now I don't know if this might be because of any of the medication I use to take (Paxil; Xanax; Atenolol; Losartan) or if it's there another cause. Basically what worries me more is that it keeps the feeling and now is 3 days and counting. Any advice will be welcome. Thank you. Metacomet,2009,2010,37,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Dr. I was perscribed Atenenol; (due to left temple pain from a hit on the head) which I had taken for 10 days; until I had chest heaviness/pain; throat thickening and cough. I then couged up blood; had chills; was lathargic with weight loss and no appetite; with 104 fever. I was admitted to the hospital; diagnosed with vasculitus; (limited wegner's vasculitus in sinuses) within days; following this reaction. Recently I discovered that the warnings on Atenenol say; to never stop Atenenol suddenly; due to harmful reactions. Vasculitus is on the list of possible reactions form Atenenol; in looking over the MEd-web. Is this a fact; that stopping Atenenol suddenly is very likely the cause of the vasculitus?

Atenolol+hypertension,I wake up from a deep sleep to a normal; sinus rhythm. The heart rate is typically in the 70's. If I take a deep breath or get up; my heart pounds and the rate jumps well over 120 BPM. This typically last just for a few minutes. I understand adrenaline and cortisol are at play; but I sense there's a rush of these molecules for some reason. It doesn't happen at any other time. And I wouldn't worry at all except for the fact that the four times I've had atrial fib it was spawned by this rapid rise in heart rate after waking and at no other time. How can I control this so it doesn't happen; other than beta blockers? Thanks.,2007,2015,60,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern. What typically used to be 120-125/70-72 has started to creep up to systolic pressures in the 145-155 range with little or no change of the diastolic pressure. It seems as I age; presently 64; isolated systolic hypertension is beginning to appear as it did with my parents. Thanks; Cody,1999,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,For the past few months I've been experiencing a lot of pressure and a throbbing; pulsing feeling in the back of my head (at the base); my neck; and the same pressure and pulsing feeling in my eyes; but its usually one eye at a time. Laying down usually makes it worse; unless I lay in just the right way which is new every time. I've read a lot online and everything says its pressure; stress; anxiety; or tension; but I honestly don't think its either. I've put hot rags and other things to relax my muscles; but that never seems to make a different. It never happens at a stressful time in my life either. Last time it happened was on vacation! My neck also starts to feel wobbly; like my head is too heavy or something. I'm really starting to worry; its almost as if there is excess fluid in the back of my head or something; if that makes any sense. But every time it happens; one of my eyes is also affected. It gets to where all I can do is close my eyes to make the pain somewhat go away. Does anyone know what this could be? Every part of me is telling me its NOT a tension/anxiety thing. Part of me thinks its more sinus related than stress related.. But I haven't had any sinus problems lately and I'm still feeling it. Anyone know what I'm describing? Oh and just some background info: I have been diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and I'm on atenolol for it. I've had my thyroid checked and all my levels were okay.,2011,2011,21,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have abused ephedrine with caffeine in the past for weight loss. Now I got urinary frequency and gastrointestinal disorder after using it 3 months back. My BP readings are like 130/90 at home. In the doctor's office it is 140/100. I got anxiety and panic attacks as a side effect and also stress from these recent health problems. Echo; ECG are normal. I got a 24hrs metanephrines urine test for catecholomines and the result was 1.3 which is bit elevated. Normal expected result is 0.9. My doc prescribed me atenolol(a beta blocker) for my hypertension 40mg once daily. but since my metanephrine result was a bit high; i suspect it might be early pheochromocytoma although the doctor says it is not. he said that people with adrenal tumors have much higher catecholomine levels which is twice or thrice the normal level of 0.9 My question is this; although the atenolol seems to control my hypertension; i have read in an online article that a "pure" beta blocker such as atenolol must never be used in the presence of a pheochromocytoma due to the risk of such treatment leading to unopposed alpha agonism and; thus; severe and potentially refractory hypertension.’ Please advise if i can use atenolol or i should go for an alternative BP medication,2010,2010,32,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Good morning; my question is this - when I go to the Dr. my BP is always high; anywhere from 170/99 to 180/100 - has been for years. I am presently on Lopressor 50 2x a day & Diovan 80mg 1x daily. I do monitor myself at home on a regular basis and it is always low.. morning 123/68 evening 99/52 or lower.. I bring these readings to my Dr. along with my BP Machine;( my machine is exactly what his says) what is going on!!! How can I control this "White Coat"? Sometimes I feel overmedicated.. very tired every afternoon; fall asleep on the couch as soon as I sit in the evening; and have so many dreams at night. Can just the anxiety of a Dr's office do this to me? Is White Coat dangerous? I appreciate your time. Thank you,2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 24 year othersise healthy male. Recently I was diagnosed with mild LVH and hypertension. This may be due to the following facts that have occured in past 4-5 years; unhealthy lifestyle; unhealthy eating; 30-35 lbs of weight gain; etc. My doctor thinks due to these factors I might have had mild and borderline high bp resulting into LVH. Is this a fair assumption? Right now; I am taking Atenolol 25 mg per day which seems to be helping. My question is with a proper care; and proper lifesyle; can I bring back my heart to normal? Can I reduce the BP and not have to be dependent on medicine for rest of my life? With 25mg of atenolol a day; the home pressure reading is below 120/80 in average and at the grocery stores; it is about 128-134/80-86. Is this Ok? Thank you. Jerry,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 46 yr old female; severely overweight. On 50 mg atenolol 2x daily; for mild-moderate hypertension. Have had benign palps for 15+ years. Have had all the tests-including a Thallium stress test ( about 7 yrs ago) and a holter as recent as 7 months ago. I have been told over the years that my palps are stress related; and am on Lexapro; and Xanax used as needed-I have GAD and panic attacks. My palps came back a year ago after being gone for a long time. After an ER visit; where I was put thru blood work; monitors; Chest xrays; etc ( this was about a year and a half ago) I was sent home being told all was fine. Iam pretty much sedentary--my job is an 8 hr desk job-I do come home and do housework--but no exercise on a daily basis. My question--I am trying to lose weight now. I have been ( for about 8 months now) taking the stairs DOWN ( no; not up..not yet) when I leave work each day. Thats 8 flights of steps. Then a walk to the car which is usually the length of a city block. When I get to the car; Iam winded-my pulse ranges from 95-113 when I first get in the car.( thats with the Atenolol). It drops within a minute or two; back to my normal range; which is upper 60s; low 70's. I have noticed that the palpitations really fire up; immediatly after I sit down. After the steps and walking stops. I do not notice them during the steps and walking. On the drive home; my palps are firing pretty good. I keep thinking; this is the time my heart will just stop. Should I stop taking the stairs down? Its something Ive done for quite a while...and have had the palps. I have off and on every day.,2007,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My son is 23; single; non smoker; non drinker; student. He did not have BP before 8 months. His BP range is 140-96 average. Doctor did some test of blood and urine and also did sonography and found nothing. He proscribed Atenolol 50 mg (half tablet a day). Do you think he should go for some more tests to know the reason of high BP? Does he have any alternative of medication? like controlled exercise; Diet etc. Doctor said; BP is the result of stress; but stress is a part of modern life.

Atenolol+hypertension,1) i am 34; m and hypertensive; i take 100mg of atenolol; 5mg amlodipine; 25mg captopril; 1/2 tab of moduretic daily then isordil for angina; i need to lose 10kg; smoke and drink moderately. I recently started having a weak erection and low energy for sex; my bp is usually 130-140/80-90. It goes higher if i drink and results in chest pain and arythmia which goes away after sometime. I tried stopping atenolol but developed a strange cough which lasted over a month. What shud i do to restore my libido 2) how safe is it to jog; my cardiologist suggested fast walking and eventually running 3} my hbp seems to be initiated by smoking and drinking and d severity of d resultant arythmia depends on how many bottles i took (card said i shudnt go beyond 2 bottles a day; and its been ok) can i stop taking my bp drugs if i stop drinking and smoking 3) in d last 6wks i have had 2 very painful abcesses inside both my nose; what shud i do,2009,2009,33,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Im 38 yr old female. Up til recently had very low BP; 90's/60's. Then; out of the blue; started getting dizzy and really bad headaches; and chest pains. At 16; was diagnosed with MVP. I work at a school; so I went down to have BP checked; it was 140/94. IT kept going up; after a week of getting it checked; I went to my FP. He checked it it was 155/110. He put me on Atenolol 25 mg. that didnt work so he increased it to 50 mg. I was sent for echo; which they found; mild mitral valve regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. I had the stress test; holtor monitor; kidneys checked. They were all okay. My father had heart disease and his mother did also. My question is "IS this a progressive thing?" Are the HBP and the valvular disease correllated? Or is a seperate issue? Im trying to make sense of this? I get this pulsating in my neck; and pounding in my chest alot. I was told its nothing to worry about. Its very uncomfortable feeling! Any thoughts would be appeciated. Thanks!,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history? Thank you.,2009,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 35; never smoke; never drink; BMI<22; height:175mm; weight:65kg; I always use to take healthy food; lots of fruits & Veg; high in fiber; less saturated fatty acid; less salt...My HDL:45; LDL:107; Total Cholesterol:168; Triglyceride:95; Blood Sugar(Fasting):83 (all are without medicine)... But my mother had Hypertension & MI at her thirties and she died at 48 on CAD. Now my hypertension was identified accidentally by our company doctor (I was feeling some discomfort due to headache; vomiting and dehydration; at that time My BP was 160/100) and he prescribe for a diuretic for two days. That medicine didn't work and Bp was still high (152/98); then he prescribed for Amlodipine 5mg & atenolol 50 mg and the very next day my BP came down to 130/90.Last one month I'm taking this . presently my BP is 116/78 at evening with medicine. My question is; should I stop this medicine to see the after affect. It is worth to mention here that in recent past my physical activity was little less and now I've increased my physical activity.

Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had an echocardiogram. The conclusions from the cardiologist report are left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 75%. Evidence of early diastolic function. Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. I am age 60. I would appreciate some feedback on this. I have high blood pressure and take Lotrel and hydrochlorthiazide.. I am considering a beta blocker if the doctor insists. The cardiologist told me the results were not bad; but heart is slightly stiff. I know that is diastolic dysfunction. Are there meds for that condition?

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a healthy 25 year old guy. I'm very physically active. I run 2-3 miles 5 times a week and lift weights as well. Hypertension runs in my family. I am currently taking 7.5mg Enalapril and 25mg Atenolol a day. This keeps my hypertension at bay. Typical readings are 120-138/80. I've had blood tests; cholesterol is great; blood sugar is fine. Last year I had a Stress+Echo (November 2009). Everything came out normal. I've had PVCs as long as I can remember. My concern is i'm a lot more aware of them now; and they typically occur with exercise. I notice them sometimes after i've done a set on bench press; or after i've run a couple of miles. I don't get a lot of PVCs in a given day (maybe 2-5 that are symptomatic). I probably am aware of PVCs say 3 times a week. Stress/Worry/Thinking about PVCs exacerbates them. Do you think I have anything to be concerned about? The stress+echo last november showed I have a perfectly healthy heart. Due to being concerned about this; I am scheduled to see a cardiologist next Friday. Could I go into V-Tach or even worse V-Fib and die? Do you think I should have an echocardiogram and holter monitor? Thank you for your input; -Mike,2010,2010,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi doc. Just need your opinion. I found your email from IMR site. I don’t know whether u can help me or not? I'm 27 yrs old male married. Had young hypertension since 2002. Took medication atenolol 50mg per day. Low risk person to infected by HIV.

The result came positive for ELISA and Indeterminate WB (only gp160 presence). After 3 weeks (9/11/2007) I repeated WB and done Viral Load. Then the results are WB still remains indeterminate as the first (only gp160 presence) and viral load is undetectable. My doc instructs me do some retest after 3 month. Can u describe my condition doc? I'm infected or not? TQ very much.,2007,2007,26,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi first I want to say thank you for your time the help that the doctors provide on here in invaluable. I am 26 and have been having IST along with headaches pain kind of where my gallbladder used to be but a little more towrd the center of the top of my stomach and wierd brown spots that are showing up pn my arms and chest and even legs biggest being about the size of an eraser. My heart rate went up the day the pain started and has not come down. without a beta blocker it is around 90's sitting the second I put my feet down to stand up it goes to to the 120+ comes down and goes up with minimal work. I know these are symptoms of IST but I wanted to see if you think this could be a pheo. I know they are very rare but do happen. if it was just the heart rate I wouldnt question it but with the head aches that I never got before and the pain the blood pressure going up even on the beta blocker over heating and the new cafe au lait spots could this be a pheo or only IST what else should I be tested for it they think it is IST... I have also had some nausea but not horrible. I know about Pots as well. I am having a ttt to determine which one I have and a 24 hour urine; should I also have the blood tested aswell? thank you for any info.,2006,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I have palpitations now for over a year. They come like in a set time. I mean; like once a day; at about the same time; I get 2 or 3 irregular beats at once. Then a hard beat; and then a faster but regular heartrhythm again. I can like feel them comming. I mean; a feel funny in my chest; and then the strange beats; then a pauze; and then a hard beat. How comes I can feel this comming? And since I have had heart examinantions; and nothing was wrong; how can I reduce my palpitations. I must say that I don't smoke or drink coffee; or even chocolate; but they still are to much. When they come in triplets; It scares me each time again. So how can I minimize them? thx,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Please feel free to read my other thread in this forum for a detailed history of my anxiety problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night.,2009,2009,29,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had a consistent bp reading of 154/96 and above for several months now. I have been on diuretics but they have made no difference at all. I am due another visit to the bp clinic on the 27th of this month. If this reading is the same then I am to go on another medication and Atenolol (sp) was mentioned. I must admit to being a little concerned about all this as the nurse mentioned to me several side effects. Are there cases where the tablets work without any effects? If I am unlucky enough to be one of the people who get side effects; are there alternatives? I honestly thought that the diuretics would be enough and I am upset at the thought of taking these drugs long term. One other question. My bp is considered to be hereditary as my mother suffers from hypertension and my father died of a massive heart attack. My daughter is now 30 years old. Should she be considering being monitored?

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question regard to the medication call Atenlol. I am 32 yeasr old female; and have several people who's got high blood pressure in my family (all Asian). I was diagnosed as High blood pressure couple weeks ago. I had my nose bleeding for couple of days after my dental surgery the other day. Right before the oral surgeon put me on to sleep; he said my blood pressure was very high; and asked me if I am taking any medication for this. The surgeon ignored my high blood pressure since I never had high blood pressure in my life; and thought probably because I was nervous. (it was 178/148 that day) For 4 days after the surgery; my nose bleed in the morning everyday. I thought it was caused from my dental surgery so I went to see my family doctor. My doctor thought that nose bleed is nothing to do with neither my dental surgery nor my high blood pressure. She thought the high blood pressure was caused by my anti-depression,2007,2007,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I am a white 46 year old male who was diagonosed with hypertension in 1994. Since that time I have been a variety of drugs including diaretics; ACE inhibitors; Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers. I am currently taking Atenolol 50 mg; Felodipine 10 mg and Maxzide 25 mg; and have yet to be controlled for more than 2 months (lower than 140/90). I also am taking Colestid 4 gr x 2 day for High Cholesterol (HDL 59; LDL 153). In 1995 I was admitted to a German hospital with a BP reaction to prescribed Motrin; whereupon I was tested with: 24 hour BP check; ECG; abdominal ultrasound; stress test and a Farbdoppler ECG; with no out of ordinary results. I have recently been tested again with a renal ultrasound and 24 urine test for a renal tumor with negative results. I am about to retire from the military and would really like to get this under control. I have a consult with a cardiac specialist at the end of the month. What should I make sure he looks for?,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have several questions concerning HDL. The last two times I have had my lipids tested my HDL has been quite low (TC 226; LDL 145; HDL 35; trig 225 and after dietary changes; exercise etc. TC 193; HDL 26). 1) I just recently attended a lipids workshop and the cardiologist mentioned a drug called Niaspan that is supposed to lower LDL; raise HDL; and lower triglycerides. I got the impression that this is a new drug and does not have the side effects that taking niacin can have. Is that true? 2) In the literature we received it said that beta blockers (I take 25 mg atenolol daily for questionable hypertension) can lower HDL. I never had my HDL measured before starting atentolol so I don't know if it has had any effect on my HDL level. 3) If I understand it correctly; the statins work by lowering the LDL. Yet Lipitor claims in its advertisements to raise the HDL as well. Is is worth taking this drug mainly to raise the HDL? I'm not sure what my LDL Is now; the second test I had was just a screening but I would think it would probably be a bit lower than the 145 it was the first time. Thank you Chris Smith,1999,1999,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia; left arm weakness and tingling sensation; irregular periods and suffer from anxiety/occassional panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG and low phosphorus.

Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I am at 75.My chest X-ray is normal and ERG is also normal.However I am having short breathing. when i do some work and even after coming from a walk;i need to breathe thro' mouth. Physician opined that nothing is wrong and by habit i express immediately what i want to talk.He advised;to sit down quietly for a while & then talk. Other physician told that some pressure come on heart on ageing and I needn't worry.I am just taking it easy;without any anxiety;but my wife has some imaginary feelings and whether; I need to go to cardiologist.Sir;my blood/urine reports are normal and have no other health issue. My BP is controlled at 145/85mm.Hg; using Amlodipine-2.5mg & Atenolol-25mg once/day in the morning;as it was 160/95mm.Hg on random checks.Physician was concerned about lower- value of 95mmHg as at times it could be 100 or above if remaining unnoticed.Hence I do take mild drugs since sept.2011. Kindly review and advise;if i am heading for serious heart problem. warm regards;,2013,2013,74,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have and c5/6 disk fusion over 10 years ago and have continual pinched neck nerve pain that I deal with all the time. MRI shows continually bad but surgery not recommended (good). Question - since I can feel when the nerve pinches; it is on right side of neck - any pressure and it gets worse and triggers bad migraines but also swells up the back of neck. I use ice and fiornal to control pain. sleep with ice packs on my neck. can this raise my blood pressure? it is high worse it gets so don't like the fact they just want to tell me to take bp med when a lot of time is is normal. can this pressure pinching pain be causing the high BP? thank you if anyone answers.,2007,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I take atenolol for fast heart rate; but lately blood pressure has been slightly high; last night high 140/93. I have been able to control BP through exercise; but medication adjustments and injuries from exercise have resulted in BP slowly creeping up. Yesterday; I must have checked my blood pressure 5-6 times. My left arm is getting sore. My question is; how often should I check my blood pressure when trying to see effect of exercise on BP. Checking my BP is a good way to see if I am working out too hard or not hard enough. Thank you.,2008,2008,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 36yo male who is looking for a bit of advice. My liver is inflamed and has been for some time; the last 3 L.F.T. results have showed rapid increase in G.G.T. levels and I am seeing my Doctor tomorrow (Public Holiday today) to get the result of the 4th L.F.T. The Doc said if the 4th L.F.T. is any worse he is referring me to a Liver disease specialist. Last night after cooking dinner I got a huge dizzy spell and went blind for 1-2 seconds and at 2am while I was trying to sleep in my air conditioned bedroom (AC set to 20 Degrees C) I suddenly felt as if the room went up to over 50 Degrees C and immediately began to sweat profusely and felt like my heart was going to explode and I had difficulty breathing. This only lasted about 15-20 seconds but it was quite frightening. I got up and chugged a glass of lemonade and went back to bed. The episode repeated itself at 4:30am and I got up and had a drink again. I will be discussing these weird symptoms tomorrow with my doctor; but I am looking for advice on if this issue could be related to my liver issues or could it be something else. I am a smoker for 24 Years (since 12yo) and have been trying to quit for the last 3-4 years.,2015,2015,35,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 23 year's old. I recently began to have extreme trouble with dizziness (about 3 months ago) and was told I had high blood pressure. They put me on Lisinopril. I ended up in the hospital a month later (Christmas Day) with chest pains. They then told me they thought the Lisinopril was to blame. They took me off Lisinopril and put me on Atenolol. The Atenolol (over the course of a couple of weeks) lowered my pulse rate too much and started causing my heart rate to become irregular. I ended up back in the hospital where they took me off of the Atenolol and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide. Unfortunately; it too seems to be disagreeing with me; and we still haven't figured out what the cause of it all is. I'll occasionally wake up in the middle of the night; sometimes right after I fall asleep; with a sudden jerking feeling and a need to breathe which usually raises my blood pressure bad. This would lead me to believe I had sleep apnea or something similar; but this doesn't always happen; and the majority of the time; my blood pressure is bad during the day as well. They've done numerous blood tests; thyroid tests; heart and kidney ultrasounds; elecrocardiograms; ran nuclear stuff through my blood stream and tracked it through an MRI; done chest x-rays; stress tests; and hooked me to heart monitors. So far; everything turns up fine according to everyone. I'm still having heart pains; irregular heart beats; bad dizziness; and my blood pressure runs high almost daily.I've been living off of grilled chicken salads with no dressing and drinking water for the past three months; but even a switch in diet doesn't seem to have helped. I really hope I can figure this out soon. My blood pressure this morning was 126/110... the bottom number being the highest it has for some time; while the top was actually low for once. However; the pulse was also 110; and I was only laying down still sleeping just moments before I checked it. I also had an irregular heartbeat once again.,2010,2010,23,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I visited my internist four weeks ago and he found my BP in 140-100. Never have BP problems; neither in my embarrasments. He gave me to take 20mg og Accupril and Claritin d for descongestant because I had an ear infection. This was the reason of my visit; because I was having dizzling sensations too. Two days after that I had my first tachycardia and went to the doctor. He told me that must be from the claritin and change acupril to Atenolol 50 mg. I went to cardiologist and make echo and stress test All WAS OK. She told me to take only 25 mg atenolol. There were two days that BP arise in the evenings to 140-90 and she told me to take 5 mg of monopril in the evenings. Now; two days ago; Iam only taking 5mg of monopril; because cardio told me to suspend it; because side effects i was feeling.I know the heart is ok and Iam waiting the blood test results including thyrod; etc. But I still have this sensation in my head of hot and cold; tingling and pressure in the temple area. Can this be from the medicine?Cardio says it is from a muscular spasm i also have.Iam getting very nervous about all this ; can BP decrease because the menstruation? I am only taking 5 mg of monopril and BP is ok.; I have panic of BP arise again... what can occur if this BP arise. Is the effect of high BP of long term or i can get a stroke in one of this episodes of Bp high;Please help with your answer..,2001,2001,,

Atenolol+hypertension,In regards to your answer I live in a small town with not many "specialist" I have has renal urine tests such as Catacolamines and medinepherines tested all normal. Let me give you a rundown on my daily symptoms. I always feel "hot" my husband says my thermostat is messed up! If you can relate to that. I have what i call hot flashes skin gets hot to the touch all over lasts for approx. 15 minutes to 2-3 hours at this time bp usually rises. Have blurred vision; see white floaters; dizzy; lightheded and have had persistent weight gain. I have noticed that symptoms are twice as bad when it is time for my menses. Has chronic BP for 11 years always controlled; Until last year has tubal after child was born Dr. recommended no more due to PIH. Also ; after i have what i call a spell i get very tired and sleepy. I have also noticed that if i have to urinate and do not go immediatly it will trigger a spell. Can you give me any ideas on what type of tests should be performed that may help give us answers. My physician says any suggestions will be helpful. Thyriod tests normal; Had renal angiogram It was also normal. Please offer some suggestions. I am only 29.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctors; I am a 31 year old woman with a pacemaker and poorly controlled atrial arrhythmias. I am currently taking atenolol 25mg day and frankly find it doing a better job with my migraine headaches than with my heart. So I am essentially stuck on it. I am concerned that in the past my echocardiograms were normal and now I had one just recently that showed that I had mild pulmonary hypertension with right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. I also have a moderate tricuspid valve insufficiency. All of these findings are new. AND with exertion over time I have noticed that I get extremely short of breath. I get depressed knowing that I have so much difficulty just trying to climb a couple stairs. I do have some sort of connective tissue disorder that has not been clearly diagnosed yet. But my key interest is with my pacemaker. I am on my second. The first one was a dual chamber single lead that turned out to be very useless and causing me more problems. So I was upgraded to a dual-chamber; dual-lead; pacer--the left in the old wire so now I have three wires in my heart and two of them going into my ventricle. I am not sure if the pacemaker could be contributing to my new heart findings. However; despite all this; my doctor's office (Internist) never informed me of the new echo findings (I requested the echo on my own volition through my internist. I was told in the past that another echo would be unnecessary). I am very disappointed and have begun to wonder if I should just give up pursuing this. Any feedback would be very appreciated.,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; First of all thank you for the advice! It is very much appreciated. I am a healthy 25 year old male; with the exception of being treated for hypertension. I am currently on 25 mg of Atenolol and 10 mg of Enalapril. My blood pressure is controlled; under 140/90. My concern is PVCs!!! They are driving me crazy. They tend to be cyclical throughout the year. Sometimes they are really bad; and for the past month they have been. Last year I had all the cardiac tests done. Echocardiogram; Stress+Echo; Stress Test and Holter Monitor. All checked out fine. The Echocardiogram was done 6 months ago. I remember the technician for the Echo saying my Left Ventricle Wall Thickness was around 10 or 11 mm; on the upper end of of a "Normal" range Left Ventricle Wall Thickness. My follow up appointment the cardiologist yielded no concerns. She felt like I did not need to see a cardiologist anymore. The thing is I lift HEAVY weights 3 times a week. Squats; Deadlifts; Bench Press....... For 5 sets of 5 reps as heavy as I can possibly lift. Lifting is very important to me. It is a great stress reliever for me; and I enjoy the results I see. I swear it has lowered my resting blood pressure. I also run 3 miles 3 times a week. All the doctors I have seen see no issue with me lifting weights. I never hold my breath (valsalva maneuver) when lifting. For the most part I have PVCs with exertion - running or walking around after sitting at my desk at work for an hour or so. Do you think the heavy weight lifting could have caused me to have left ventricle hypertrophy since I had the Echo 6 months ago? Are the PVCs with exercise/exertion a signal of this? I went to the cardiologist office last week and saw a nurse's practitioner. She did a resting ECG and checked my blood pressure. All were fine. She did not seem concerned. Should I have another Echo to make sure I do not have LVH? I am hopeing this is just anxiety and I do not have a structural heart issue. Thank you; Mike,2009,2011,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I've been taking a beta blocker for over a year now; at first I started taking it every day for about 8 months. Now I'm only taking it during the week; it does help me a lot to function like a 'normal' person. I do suffer from a bit of depression; but overall I'm generally a happy person. I'm a young man; mid 20s. I was prescribed this medicine by my local doctor and have been taking it ever since; I went to see a shrink shortly after but haven't been since. I don't take them on the weekends; and I've stopped taking them in the mornings because of constant tiredness at work. I only take half a tablet each day (25mg). My question is: am I causing long term damage to my body by taking this everyday? Suffer from severe social anxiety; I still suffer from the social anxiety when taking the medicine; except the blushing isn't as severe.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,(1) Can LVH show up suddenly on EKG; in light of a normal EKG the year before? (2) Can EKG's produce "false-positives" for LVH? (3) When it is said that LVH occurs as a result of hypertension; does that mean a length of time of uncontrolled; chronic hypertension; or can it develop over a short period (6 months) of anxiety-produced hypertension? (4) Can successful treatment w/ beta-blockers regress LVH?,2001,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Six weeks ago I had oral surgery for an abscessed tooth and shortly thereafter had angina for about a week. It has subsided completely at present. At the time of the angina bouts I saw my Dr who did a nuclear stress test. It showed some ischemia in the lower regions of the heart so he sent me to a cardioligist who has prescribed me atenalol while I wait for an ultra fast CT scan. My BP was 128/88 or what they called the 'high side of normal'. I am cautious about using drugs if there are alternatives. I am reading a lot of complaints from people with side effects; tiredness; depression; nightmares; etc on this drug. Are these people the 1-5% the drug company claim or is the problem more widespread? At the same time; I have devoured mountains of material on CHD and find an alarming difference of opinions between researchers and even between cardioligists themselves about whether beta blockers are a good step. 90% of research says beta blockers do nothing to prevent 1st heart attacks in people with angina. 10% of the research says they do prevent 1st heart attacks. Numerous cardiologists say they are lifesavers; while others say avoid them; or that there are more effective classes of drugs. The research does favor beta blockers for those who have had a heart attack and want to avoid a second one; but I have only had a brief spell of angina and am not getting them now so would rather work on the Ornish; Esselstyn plant based reversal plans drug free if I can. Is this wise or should I use the atenalol? Thoughts?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues. Thanks a lot; all the best; Leonel,2007,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am on low doses of atenolol 25 mg.for mild hypertension 145/95. I will need to take Larium (Melfoquine) for malaria prophylaxis for 8 weeks. Are there any reports of untoward cardiac reactions when these drugs are taken together? I had a period of PVC's lasting for 8 months at 250 PVC's per day. One year ago I went back into normal rhythm and do not have any except for an occasional one. Thanks for any answer.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jim: Atenolol and mefloquine can potentially interact. Their concurrent use can cause abnormalities on the electrocardiogram; there are reports of cardiac arrest from simultaneous use of these drugs. In addition; mefloquine can cause extra heart beats (PVCs); while atenolol can suppress them. Using two or more medications simultaneously always raises the possibility of drug interactions. The risks of possible interactions need to be weighed against the benefits of the medications. This is something that is best done by your own doctor; who knows you and your medical history. Do not stop taking atenolol without consulting your physician; as sudden cessation of this class of medications can cause problems. If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a cardiologist. Information provided in the Heart Forum is for general purposes only. Specific diagnoses and therapies can only be provided by your doctor.,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm on a low dose of Atenolol (25mg once daily) for a fast heartbeat. After eating a large meal my heartrate will be around 70-110 but feels faster because of the bad palpitations. Usually around 3 hours after that meal my heartrate will slow back down to 50-70 but the palpitations sometimes continue making me feel uncomfortable. Anyways; I just walked up my stairs and my heartrate went up to about 130 with very bad palpitations and I could feel and hear my heartbeat in my ear. This has happened before on morning afters of heavy drinking. It doesn't happen often but when it does it's pretty scary. I couldn't check my blood pressure when I went upstairs cause my blood pressure machine was downstairs. When I came back down and checked it it was good at 123/79 and heartrate was 57. In April of this year I had an echo done and it showed 2nd degree diastolic disfunction but normal size and ejection fraction and an ekg showed leftward axis. What would cause this hearing and feeling of my heartbeat in my ear; this time it was just my left ear. If you have any questions; please ask. Thanks..,2010,2011,31,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Dr. Blood pressure had been well controlled in the past with Norvasc 10mg 1x daily and Metroprolol 25mg 2x daily. However; most recently; experiencing high blood pressure since the Nephrologist switched the Norvasc to Lorsartan 100mg 1x daily. Readings have been in the mid 160's even in the 170's. In addition; the Metroprolol was discontinued (it wasn't really helping the heart palpations) and have been prescribed Atenolol 25mg 1x daily for the heart palpitations. Now; Dr is adding Nifedipine 30mg 1x daily to try and lower blood pressure. Is it okay to take Atenolol 25 mg 1x daily; Lorsartan 100mg and the Nifedpine 30mgs? Isnt that a lot of "different types" of medications especially being recently (less than 1 year) post transplant? Is this safe? I do however need to have the high blood pressure addressed. Advice/help. Thank you in advance.,2010,2014,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I totally can. I told my doc this and she said it was. I'm a 26 year old male; non smoker. The thing is; lately I've been feeling it go up and down quickly. It feels like an uncomfortable pressure in my head and chest with a slowing heart until my heart "thumps" and the pressure subsides. This happens quite often during the evening; usually when I'm standing up doing very little exertion. It doesn't happen as often when I'm laying down but it is still there. I'm coming off of a beta blocker (currently at 6.25mg...i'm very sensitive so I have to come off of it very slow). I'm on a low sodium diet (mostly whole foods) and I take a proton pump inhibitor. I suspect I may be low on some electrolytes. I had some blood work done last month but; for some reason; my doc didn't order an electrolyte test. I've been taking the PPI for probably close to 10 years now. Perhaps this is another explanation? Any ideas what I'm up against? This happened but to a MUCH lesser extent when I was at full dose (25mg twice daily) of atenolol. It never hurts but I'm forced to stop whatever I'm doing until it fixes itself. It's very uncomfortable and my heart will thump sometimes to fix it. It's not PVCs because the heart isn't stopping momentarily. I know what PVCs feel like. This happens to coincide when my heart gradually slowly down for a few beats before correcting itself back to the normal rhythm. Any ideas? It's annoying and I am unsure if it should be cause for alarm.,2015,2015,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old female with a pacemaker; that was placed about a year ago after a sinus node ablation. Now I am in A-Fib on/off all day. I now take coumadin; verapamil; metoprolol and tambocor. The meds. have never worked. My E.P. Dr. said he doesn't think meds. will work and says I need to choose between a new catheter ablation procedure; or an av node ablation. I am very symptomatic as well. I can't lay down at night without several pillows (can't catch my breath; and I feel like my head will pop there's so much pressure; and I have trouble exerting etc.) A recent echo. showed mild tricuspid regurg.; and mild mitral regurg.; also mild pulmonary hypertension; I can't remember what else). I also had a recent V.Q. scan (my internist ordered)because I get very sharp pains at times when I breath in. The result was low-probability. No follow-up after that. I also have a patent foramen ovale. My questions are as follows: A)Do you you have any ideas what would cause chronic a fib after a sinus node ablation? B)Do you have an opinion as to which procedure is best to teat A-Fib? My Dr. seems very confused about what to do. C)Also I'm wondering about what mild pulmonary hypertension may indicate; and should it be followed up? D) Does a low-probobility v.q. scan correlate to pulmonary hypertension? E)Should I tell my E.P. DR. the results of the V.Q. scan the internist did? I'm sure the rsesults are probobaly insignificant but none of it was explained to me so I'm a little curious. I have alot of faith in my Drs. I truly appreciate any help or insights you have. It all has been so much to deal with lately.,2000,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Dr.; I am f; 5'5" and 125lb; and soon to be 47. I am in good health considering many diagnoses. I have had a little more than a few echoes. I was diag with mild mvp; mild mr; and mild tr. This last echo took place in the hospital this year and had an added element. It said mildly elevated pulmonary pressure. (I was admitted to hosp with L. shoulder and arm pain; and a coincidentally abnorm ekg. It turned out to be c-spine pain.) The cardio asked if I smoked; had asthma; pneumonia at any time; or severe case of bronchitis. The answer is "no" to all. Both my parents had emphysema late in life; neither smoked. Mom did have chronic bronchitis and later asthma; pneumonia a number of times. (Mom had 2 bypasses and a MVR and died of CHF). Dad worked with chemicals for printed circuitry; don't know if that means anything. We lived in front of a furniture factory that left paint all over surfaces in our yard and in the kitchen window. I gave that history to explain possiblities for the emphysema; because I wonder if it may be related to something here. Are there any further tests I should have for the PP? Or just wait for a symptom or a few years for another test? Thank you.,1999,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently visited a cardiologist in Miami; Florida after having severe intermittent chest pain over the past couple of years. I also suffer from pac's and pvc's and bouts of fast heartrate. I had a stress test and holter monitor done in 1987; everthing was completely normal and was assured not worry. After having a severe bout of pvc's/pac's in 1998; my doctor put me on atenolol 25mg twice daily which I must admit controlled the palpitations so well I almost feel cured. I don't suffer the side effects of most beta blockers for which I am grateful; mostly only nightmares. I decided to visit a cardiologist after suffering from severe attacks of chest pain; which my doctor diagnosed as costachondritis. The cardiologist did an EKG and an echocardiogram after I told him of my symtoms. He said my symtoms were not anginal and that my ekg and echo were normal besides showing marginal concentric left ventricular hypertrophy which was probably due to mild hpertension; usually 140/90 in the dr. office and 120/75 at home. I visited my internist who visits where i live every 4 months and gave a copy my report from the cardiologist. He did an ekg and said it showed no signs of hypertrophy and my report was essentially normal. The only other thing that was mentioned in the report was that I had no frank mitral valve prolapse; but that there was a redundant pattern of motion of the mitral leaflets. My question to you; do you think the hpertrophy that I have is of any clinical signifance or if i should get an repeat echo in another year and do you thinks the redundant motion of the mitral leaflets could suggest a mild mitral valve prolapse as i do present with most of its symptoms. Thanks for taking my question and i apologise for length and detail; also a great thanks for this beautiful forum Thanks again; Hank.,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dr. Mark; Can you tell me what the symptoms are of Pheochromocytoma? My endo said that if my symptoms don't improve within two weeks we'd look into my hyperthyroid symptoms more to see if something else was going on (I'm on methimazole and atenolol). I have a lot of symptoms that coincide with pheochromocytoma; however; my b/p is 80/60 on the atenolol; and the only headaches I get are the everyday headaches. I had an abdominal CT scan about a year ago that was negative for appendicitis. I just feel like I have adrenaline surges that go through my body and they can occur when trying to sleep or just watching tv. I have a very hard time believing that this is from anxiety. Thanks.,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have noticed recently (over the past few months) that I have been acting oddly. First of all; I find myself having to urinate frequently. This usually occurs during school but sometimes in the evening as well. It is not everyday that I feel like this. Yesterday; for example; I had to urinate 9 times between 8:30 am and 3:30 pm; however; today; I only had to urinate 3 times. In addition; I think that I have become increasingly moody; but; to be perfectly honest; I have always been known for my moodiness; so its a little bit hard to tell; lol. Now; today I went to the doctor to check up on my high blood pressure; which I seem to be doing more and more these days. She had me do a urine test; which came back as very high in sugar (I didn't ask what the number was.) When she pricked my finger; however; my blood sugar was low; 67; I believe. My doctor said that the urinalysis must have been inaccurate; but; given my symptoms; I am not so sure. Is it possible for me to be diabetic and just expel massive amounts of sugar through my urine? Oh; I almost forgot; I can feel when my blood sugar is low; and it doesn't happen very often. I could definitely feel that it was low when the nurse pricked my finger. Do you think that I should just ignore it or what? A few other odd symptoms: I randomly will find that a toe; finger; or maybe even a whole hand will become completely cold. It is like it is not even part of my body. It isn't numb; just cold. The feeling typically goes away after a while. I am noticing red; splotchy stops; especially on the front of my ankles. Is this related? Finally; I have felt tired a lot lately. Is this a part of it? Now I take atenolol; which is a beta blocker; for my hypertension. I am not sure how much of this is related to that. PLEASE give me your thoughts! I have another doctors appointment in a week and want to go in armed and ready! Thanks guys; Paul,2007,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Doc; Maybe you can give me a clue as to why I'm having these. Last night I opened my eyes at 4 am and saw something similar to a Jackson Pollack's painting. Little squiggles and lines; all moving and changing shape. When I closed my eyes I still saw these but in shades of gray! They lasted for several minutes and dissappeared. I've had night time hallucinations for over 10 years now; sometimes I see complex patterns; like mosaics or tiles changing colors or shapes. A few times I saw hazy snow like a bad tv reception. Are these migraine auras or what? I am a 53 yo female; on meds for hypertension and diabetes. Hx of migraine. Any ideas appreciated.,2003,2006,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Two part medical questions : I have been treated for high blood pressure for last 15 years (was taking Atenolol-50 mg & Lisinopril-30mg). Recently; I was diagnosed with palpitations (PVC's) by a Cardiologist. (via EKG test) I was directed by this physician to start taking Atenolol (100MG) and Lisinopril (40MG) as treatment for the PVC condition. Assumption is that by lowering my BP it will eliminate or better control the PVC events. Does this sound appropriate? Since I'm very nervous and apprehensive when these PVC events occur (which probably drives up my PB even more!); would the additional use of Ativan (.05mg) or Celexa (20mg) help calm me while I deal with these conditions .... or would they conflict with current Hypertension medication? Patrick This discussion is related to drug side effects for PVC treatment.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello all My doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 40mg when my blood pressure was 170/105 at hospital about 6 months ago. I had dizziness (electricity going through my brain feeling) and fatigue; hard time breathing before the doctor's visit; but even after the medication; the symptoms continued. But; my blood pressure was regulated to around 110/80. Then; slowly; my blood pressure started coming down even more to 100/80; 90/70; then 80/60. So Doctor told me to take only 20mg of lisinopril every day. I did. Then; even more serious headaches; dizziness; and feeling like fainting; and high blood pressure. So Doctor then prescribed Atenolol 25mg per day. One week of trial. Even higher blood pressure around 170/110. So Doctor then advised that I should take both Lisinopril 30mg in the morning; and Atenolol 25mg at night. This has been working quite well for few weeks; bringing my blood pressure to 100/60 almost every time I measured it. But; recently; I started having those peak moments where I would start freezing/trembling; severe headaches/dizziness; and my legs had no strength that I fell few times. My arms/hands felt like there was no circulation; that I coudnt even hold a drug bottle. Blood pressure around 165/110. Then; I took Xanax. This helped almost every time I had this happened to me. But; these days; those happenings where I would have crazy dizziness and weakness in all my body and my blood pressure going up skyhigh come to me more often. Everytime I take Xanax; it does help; but only temporarily. Doctor tells me that I am having panic/anxiety attacks; and the medications actually do work; because all that matters is the average blood pressure; not just few incidents per week. I feel like there must be some other hypertension medication out there that should get rid of these symptoms and get my blood pressure stable. Because when it's stable; I feel OK. These days; not. I have high blood pressure very often even with the medications... not the anxiety attacks... I don't know what to do. Doc tells me to stop worrying and keep my current meds; but I want to change them.,2010,2010,49,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Recently I've been having episodes of spiking blood pressure; makes my ears ring; I get a headache (sometimes burning; sometimes at back of skull); etc. Went to GP; did 24 hr urine; CT scan of head; carotid doppler; renal scan all negative. She sent me to my cardio; bp in office was 150/100. Said that since all the biggies were negative he felt a lift style change was in order. I take Avalide 150/12.5 and Atenolol 50 mg; am/pm for Avalide and he did up my Atenolol to twice a day. He wants me to walk 30 mins a day and lose 25 lbs in 6 mos. However; my head aches the minute I more my ears ring to. He seems to think they are not connected. I'm really; really terrified! Oh and I had a heart cath in Oct 2008 all okay; but he did mention an S4 but said it would go away when the pressure comes down. He said; "this will pass" and I asked him "before I do"; he didn't seem concerned. He is one of the best in NYS. Can anybody give me some reassurance? I so worried and that's probably not helping anything for sure.,2008,2009,47,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am 48 yr old male with Juvenile onset Diabetis. About 6 months ago I had a brief spell of a-fib that caused a chain reaction of doctor visits; cariologist visits; tests that all came out normal. My cardiologist put me on metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice per day. Although he told me it was a benign drug I have many side effects including fatigue and drowsiness; some dizzyness; and loss of sex drive and ED problems. The side effects were really hampering my ability to function throughout the day. About 3 weeks ago i tapered off metoprolol of which my last dose was 1 1/2 weeks ago. everything went fine but now am having issues with blood pressure spikes; chest pains. tachy-cardia spells and dizzyness. I really feel crummy. My thinking was that I was having withdrawls from not taking metoprolol but why the symptoms after almost two weeks from taking it? I am tempted to go back on the drug to alleviate these symptoms as they are kind scary. I do not want to be on this drug and feel there is no need for it. I have mild hypertension and proir to metoprolol was taking low dose of lisinopril which I am back on now.,2013,2013,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have recently developed hypertension 140/90. My usualy heart rate is 72 to 80. I lead a very health lifestyle and exercise daily. I was started on atenolol 50mg qd. Soon after taking it I developed bradycardia 48 to 52 and the BP went up to 160/96. Could this be a reaction to the medication?,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; has anyone took birth control pills and blood pressure pills together? My pharmacist said it was safe to take them together. I take Aetenolol for high BP; and am wanting to start a low dose birth control pill. If anyone has taken these pills in combination; were there any side effects for you? Did your blood pressure remain low? Thanks....,2002,2004,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control. Thanks - Cody,1999,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 43 year old male; and have been on atenolol and lotensin for 7-8 years for hypertension and nagging PACs. Two years ago at my cardiologist's recommendation; I began taking 40 mg of Zokor (I have recently reduced it to 20 mg/day) since I have gotten regular readings of total cholesterol at 200-230; HDL 29-45; LDL 140-170. There is a history of heart attack on my mother's side (herself at 48 and her father at 39 years old). Tests from holter monitors; treadmills and echos indicate no signs of CHD in me yet. I am considering stopping the Zokor even though it is doing the job; because I swear it is causing my hair to fall out which is a big deal to me since I have always had a lot of it. My cardiologist says Zokor isn't the likely culprit. My question is this: Could Zokor and/or the other two drugs be contributing to the sudden thinning; and would it do any good to switch to a non-statin? I really hate taking so many medications.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping you will give me an opinion on this. I have had a lot of symptoms over the years that now suggest that I could possibly have Behcet's disease. I have an appointment with the rheumatologist I saw for similar problems (about 10 years) in February. I am a 49 year old premenopausal (as far as I know; tested last January) female; with a not so great lipid picture(TC 216 after much effort; LDL 145; HDL 26; Trig 225). My weight is normal; don't smoke; take 25mg atenolol daily for mild hypertension. Lately I have noticed what I believe could be angina symptoms and this has me concerned. When I walk uphill I get chest discomfort that goes into my neck and sometimes my left shoulder. If I slow down or walk on even ground it goes away. It never happens any other time (such as under stressful situations)and always happens when I walk uphill (although sometimes worse than other times) I joined a fitness program about a year ago (had to stop because I developed sacroiliac problems but I do walk 2 miles 4-5 times per week)where I had what was called a submaximal multilevel treadmill stress test. These angina symptoms did not happen during this test; which was declared normal. My question is that I have read that vasculitis of the coronary arteries can cause symptoms similar to angina symptoms. Since Behcet's disease is a vasculitis type disease; often with episodes coming and going intermittently; I am wondering if that could possibly be causing my symptoms that resemble angina. If so; does this still mean that the coronary arteries are not getting enough oxygen; or would angina symptoms from vasculitis not mean the same as angina symptoms from CAD? Thank you for your opinion. As I said; I have an appt with the rheumatologist and plan to discuss this with him. Chris S.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Physicians at Cleveland Heart Clinic; Is it unlikely to have angina like symptoms only at rest and never while jogging/running daily? If so; what may be the causes of these at rest symptoms? I always believed angina was escalated with exercise and/or cold. Also; during an angina episode is one's blood pressure and heart rate likely to become elevated? Thanks - CM,1999,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I currently have a history of svt; taken care of by a ablation. I currently have severe pvc's that can drive me out of my mind when they occur. I was on atenol 25mg daily; which unfotunately caused my airway to constrict so I had to go off of that. (It worked great). My Cardiologist put me on Rhythmol 150mg 2x day. I have read bad side effects of this medication and am terrified of taking it.I didn't take it yet. Is there another choice of medication for pvc's I can talk to my Dr about? What about Calcium channel blockers? Is Rhythmol that dangerous of a drug for a healthy heart? Thank you,2002,2002,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I was recently diagnosed with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism and have been on Levoxyl(or something like it initially LOL) for over a month. Interestingly; my average blood pressure reading has significantly declined latley. It was borderline; 130's (sometimnes 140's) over 90's for last few years; but have now been getting readings in the 100's (systolic) with diastolic readings in the upper 60's. Last echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction and had me wondering if the thyroid replacement is causing the BP to fall? Is it possible the diastolic function will show improvement now? I have always been active; exercise-wise; but have recently also started to be even more active. Maybe it's because of that? Thanks for answering. -Kit,2005,2007,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I appreciate any and all who can help me. Currently taking calcium channel blocker-diltiazem for tachycardia and high blood pressure; HBP not too high; but heart rate is. Does anyone know anything about carvedilol? How safe is it; what are the side effects? Has anyone heard of it being prescribed for tachycardia? HIgh blood pressure? I am sick of taking/switching medications; most of all I am sick of having tachycardia and believe my heart rate is just naturally higher than others' heart rates. They told me to stop the calcium channel blocker cold turkey and start the new medication; I thought I was suppossed to wean off of my current medication. What's going to happen if I don't wean off of it? This is driving me crazy!!!!!!!,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had some 'interesting' symptoms of late; they seem to lean towards colon cancer; though it has been 'suggested' here that it could maybe be colitis [which though I don't believe; I don't don't either]. Before these symptoms; I was being investigated for kidney disease; all was clear; cystoscopy; scan [like the one they use on pregnant ladies] and an X-ray. Recently; I have been feeling slight pain in my right kidney area; though before I'd have described it as 'my top rib' and the pain comes as I sneeze; cough; pass a constipated stool; walk too far etc; but now; today; I have been asked to call in for blood tests; and I find the abbreviations slightly alarming considering all else what clear; so I wonder if you could help shed some light please? ::Clinical Details:: Stage III CRF ::Chemical Pathology:: LFT [and I think] UTE. Could you just clarify what that means; and if the clinical details 'suggest' that I 'may' have Stage III CRF or I 'do' have Stage III CRF. I am only 84.3% sure what the 'CRF' means after an online search; but I'd rather hear from someone here. Thank you.,2008,2008,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39 yr old female. At age 29 I was diagnosed with High Blood pressure & low potassium (had low potassium for a few yrs b4) Started taking Atenoretic 50 mg - 1 a day for blood pressure and potassium pills. 2-3 years later; I had swelling so they switched me to Atenolol/Chlorthal 50/25 - 1 a day. Each year my potassium has gotten worse. About 5 yrs ago they added Spironolactone 25 mg twice a day to help w/potassium. In the past yr my potassium pills have doubled (I now take 12 - 10meq potassium pills a day) we are having difficulty keeping my potassium above the "low" normal. My doctor tested for aldosterone and renin; both of which came back high. She sent me to an Endocrinologist who did a renal artery duplex test which came back normal. All kidney blood test have come back normal & no signs of diabetes. The Endocrinologist sent me back to my doctor; neither of which has ordered any more test or changed any meds. Basically endocrinologist is done w/me & my doctor said she’ll see me at my check up in March. My blood pressure has remained in control all these years and still is (113/68) give or take a few on each. I have high cholesterol -238. Not on meds for this. I did not take spironlactone for 3 days (kept forgetting to pick up at pharmacy) I had tingling in hands; legs & face along w/ chest pains) Once the medicine was in my system; all symptoms went away. I am tired all the time; muscle weakness; get sick when I exercise w/ cramps & diarrhea. pee every hour or two – periods are irregular; thirsty & do not sleep well.

MRI from 12/06 indicates RV and LV normal in size with normal systolic function. Mitral; aortic and tricuspid valves and cnetral pulmonary valves normal. Echo from 10/06--consistent except Left atrium mildly dilated Right Atrium normal. LV mild concentric hypertrophy and mitral valve leaflets mildly thickened. Results form 12/07 MRI---LV & RV mildly dilated normal systolic function; RA&LA moderately dilated; valves---no change; no change in anuerysm; EF 50%.

Take Atacand 24 mg; Vytorin 10/20; Atenolol 25 mg. Question: My general MD says that the atriums are probably the size of my natural heart. this is not consistent with previous studies----can you explain the increase in atrium size---possible mis reading of MRI? Am i at risk? what can i do to reduce the enlargement? I worry about these things! Should i see my cardiologist? Previous CATS; EKG; and Stress (all w/i a 18 mos) no evidence of dialtin of atrium.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia and suffer from aniety/panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG. Not sure if this plays any part in thyroid issues as well. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!,2008,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 38 year old female and have always had blood pressure of 117/74 or lower. The odd time it would be 120/80 but this was rare. For the last 4 days i've checked my pressure and it has been on average 129/76 (i check it very regularly at the drug store). I've very concerned that it is this high so quickly. I've always battled my weight and am currently on the Weight Watchers program. I don't smoke; don't drink and really don't have alot of stress in my life. I had a stress test approximately 4 months ago and received the highest possible score of 7+ minutes walking at a fast speed. Is this something I should notify my Dr. about? What could cause bp to raise to such a high level in such a short time and stay there? Many thanks.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP & heart rate; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. After having the baby I went to the new PCP again I've been seeing; and he did another EKG (Feb. '09). This time the EKG read non specific abnormalities in leads V4-V6... normal sinus rythym 90 BPM. The dcotor said the EKG was abnormal & I needed to see a cardiologist. How could the EKG's differe so quickly? What do the results mean?,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Jim on March 25; 1998 at 16:14:45: I am on low doses of atenolol 25 mg.for mild hypertension 145/95. I will need to take Larium (Melfoquine) for malaria prophylaxis for 8 weeks. Are there any reports of untoward cardiac reactions when these drugs are taken together?

Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking 25 mg of metoprolo a day (1/2 pill twice daily) just for some minor issues with PVCs. After several months I got hives and some food sensitivity that is evidently a side effect; so I decided to stop. My cardiologist seemed to think this is a low enough dose that I could just stop cold if I wanted to; but I thought I'd see what folks thought; if I should taper off.,2008,2012,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 68 year old lady in formerly good health but now suffer from PAF which is increasing to the point where I had a four day stay in hospital a few months ago;but it then reverted on its own. Now I get approx a 3-4 hour episode every few weeks. I also take Valsartin for hypertension(Co-Diovan 12.5) for a number of years and this is successful. I was previously taking Atenolol for this; but was put on 10 mg daily Bisoprolol in the hospital; also placed on a Warfarin program. Some six weeks later I was taken off the Warfarin and put on a low dose daily aspirin. I wore a Novocor monitor for a week which showed transient AF but also bradycardia (about 42bmp) and the specialist recommended a possible pacemaker for this in the future. As my episodes increase; I have questioned such a high dose of Bisoprolol which I read can slow the heartbeat; ie one drug to slow the heartbeat and a pacemaker to speed it up? I had not been aware of any bradycardia prior to all this; but then I was undiagnosed with any brewing heart problems for several years I think. My surgery doctor has decreased the Bisoprolol to 7.5 and says we will wait to see the effect. My question is really about the suitability of Bisoprolol for my condition. Here in England they never mention ablation or any of the suggestions I read of in US sites. I just would like to know the sensible way forward and the way to self-help. In between attacks I feel fit and well; though tired for a couple of days afterwards. During; I often feel lightheaded. Many thanks.,2007,2011,68,Female

That was the reason why I did a colonoscopy in the first place; no abnormalities were found at all besides a small benign polyp which was removed and analysed and determined benign. I am a very relaxed person; I do not suffer from any form at stress at all. Strangest part?! I share the same symptoms with my Father; my Brother and My cousin family. They all started to suffer from Gastro-Intestinal Disturbances / Hypertension / Hair loss; exactly like me. And around the same time as I started. And when I say gastro intestinal disturbances I mean so severe that once I was rushed into the ER with a very staggering pain in the lower GI (below the belly button); I felt as if I was getting stabbed with a knife (from 0 to 10 I'd say 9.5; the pain level); the pain did not go away and the doctors thought I had apendicitis at the time; I did an MRI from the neck down and it revealed that everything was normal; so I was discharged without any treatment besides Buscopan. Because my close relatives suffer from the same symptom I assumed it was infectious; but the CBC ruled that out. I am going to perform an exam this wednesday to check whether or not I am poisoned with a metal compound such as Barium (my town had a case of barium contamination in a place near the water supply). Been a few months that I been exercising regularly; it didn't change much besides slowing my heart rate. But I still feel palpitations which are VERY annoying; especially after I eat something. I dont even need to say that I been o thousands of doctors; right? And did THOUSANDS of exams to try to find a cause for my hypertension and NOTHING. I've been told I was Hypochondriac and that my symptoms are related to stress; and quite frankly I am very tired of hearing such a thing. My story is simply: One day I was normal the next I was shitting blood; loosing hair and hypertensive. I was not stressed or depressed before or after it happened and I still am not. Do I feel incredibly thirsty? Not presently; but when I use to consume junk food back in 2006 yes; I did and quite regularly. My forehead is very oilish; which indicates liver problems. My LDL cholesterol is very low which indicates liver problem. Did I do Liver Biopsy? No doctors ordered it; so; no. Did I loose or gained weight? My weight has always been around 154 pounds; I do not get any more fatter nor skinnier. Did I have fever? Maybe not; I might have felt a little warm but not in a concerning level so I didnt even check. Do I still suffer from bloody diarrhea? Not bloody anymore; but I still suffer from diarrhea when I eat certain foods such as rice or junk food. My Hairloss is so weird that whenever I clean my room I find hair from my legs; arms; and in massive amounts; they just come out. When I have to remove hair from my nose I dont even feel pain; it just comes out as if it was loosen up there. I been SUFFERING with these problems since 2005; came around to really know them in 2006. Perhaps that if it was only me who had those symptoms I would feel hypochondriac indeed; but my brother; my father and my cousin family (two females and one male) are experiecing the exact same symptoms. Now I am trying to find a fellow doctor who would be kind into analyzing my case and not just dismissing me as a hypochondriac or stressed. Thanks if you took the time to read this; I appreciate; I put some effort into writing it because I wanted to know if anybody could help me and not just dismiss me as a hypochondriac.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 59 year old male. Past medical history of controlled hypertension and cervical fusion C5-7 in 2004 for spinal stenosis. I was doing fine until about 7 months ago. My house was being painted and the painters used a very strong smelling lacquer on the woodwork. I have no idea if this has anything to do with the problem; but it coincided with the onset of my symptoms. I developed vertigo. I was first diagnosed with BPPV and sent for Epley maneuvers. When these didn't help; I underwent a video nystagmogram which was read as normal. The symptoms persisted along with intermittent headaches. General lab work including workup for autoimmune disease was negative as were MRIs of the brain and neck and carotid dopplers. A neurosurgeon recommended a epidural steroid injection which relieved the headaches as well as some visual problems I was having; but had no effect on the vertigo. Actually; the vertigo morphed into more of a feeling of dizziness with my head swimming. There was no nausea or vomiting. Another ENT suggested vestibular migraine; but the addition of nortriptyline did nothing. Lying flat my symptoms are almost gone. Sitting up my head spins but I can tolerate the symptoms. However; standing and walking are intolerable. I was off work for a few months but after some vestibular rehab; I have returned with limited success. I've also tried acupuncture and gentle cervical manipulation without success. I fear I will have to retire. No days are good; but some are worse than others. Somedays I have headaches; others I do not. My meds are unchanged and include Losartan; atenolol; HCTZ; and Simvastatin. Any ideas?,2012,2012,58,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 31 year old male and I was recently prescribed Adderall IR 10mg for ADD. The Psychiatrist told me to take two pills a day; as each pill gets out of your system within/around 4 hours. I noticed upon taking the first pill on the first day around 9am; I didn't feel it wearing off until the early evening; so I wasn't about to take another. Although the "wearing off" made me feel exhausted and the same feeling on the second day. Today is the third day and I took the pill around 8:30 this morning and felt the effects dwindling about an hour ago. I'm just curious--I'm assuming there is some sort of period where your body has to get used to the Adderall? Not like building up a tolerance to it necessarily; but your body simply adjusting to the new medication? It's weird too because I do have a bit of anxiety without the Adderall; but with the Adderall there is still some nervous energy there; but it feels more focused. Like the anxiety is attempting to rear its ugly head but I'm able to keep it at bay a little better. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Also; I was concerned that my BP jumped up a few points when I started taking it and I hope that will normalize a bit as well. I take Atenolol 50mg for hypertension; and it hangs around 125-130 over 80 most days. With the Adderall; I can see the systolic number getting just under 140 with the diastolic number sometimes hitting 85-90. I know I'm already borderline with my BP but if it goes back to normal after a few weeks; I'm not too concerned.,2009,2013,31,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Dr. History: I am a 49 yr old F; not over wt.; don't smoke or drink. Am more or less sedentary. I have mild MVP; w/mild MR and TR. I am being treated for IST and NCS. I am on 81 mg. of aspirin for Factor V Leiden; I have Raynaud's and misc diag. Meds: verapamil;atenolol; misc. My mother had a double bypass and MVR and yrs later died of CHF at 75. Her sister died of a "weak heart" after giving birth to a "blue baby" at around 30; her bro. died at 42 from a stroke. Mom and Dad had emphysema late in life and never smoked. I don't know if any of that is relevant. My last echo 2-3 yrs. ago said "mildly elev. pulmonary pressure". My ? is; all the other echoes had TR; but never mentioned this. What are the chances I really have it? Could this be incorrect? My new PCP wants to do another echo to see if it's chg'd and maybe send me to a pulmonologist. What do you think? (In the past I've been told my lips were purple. I get sob w/o the tachy). What tests should be done? When/Should I see a pulmary dr. or ph spec.? The other ? is about vague heart attack symptoms; chest pain. I went to the ER 2-3 yrs ago and they thought I was having a heart attack. I had L. upper back; neck; and arm pain and coincidental EKG chgs. It would feel better when standing.It was C-spine prob. Last night I had sim. pain w/pressure too; but when I sat it got better;when stand'g it acted up again. I didn't go to the ER;because it wasn't a 9 or 10. How do you know when to go? Another ?;I get PAC's and the other day had 2 that caused near syncope. Why would this happen? Thanks,1999,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 31 yr old female with a long history of arrhythmia problems. I wear a pacemaker after repeated EP studies and ablation failed to correct my problem with atrial tachycardias. I am writing because I believe I have received more bad news. I very recently had an echo which showed that I had some enlargement of my right atria and ventricle; along with moderate tricuspid insuffiency. I also have been determined to have mild pulmonary hypertension. All of these findings are new; I have never had them before until now. The report says my RV systolic pressure is 33mm above my RA pressure. I have been trying to understand what these numbers mean. However; overall; I have not heard good things about pulmonary hypertension. I also because of my condition am 100% dependent on my pacemaker for my life and I am concerned that the leads could be contributing to the problem. I actually have 3 leads--one atrial and two ventricular--one is a lead from a past pacer that caused me serious problems. The lead was not compatible with my upgraded machine which has two wires. Now I have this third wire in there just hanging around. I am also despondent about why my physician's office never told me about these results. (This is not the first time; however; delays for abnormal results have been stashed away in a chart unbenounced to the patient). Because I didn't get notified; I am really not sure what to think. Is this important? It doesn't seem that way to my doctor's office. Thanks for any feedback you can give me here.,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was placed on Atenolol 50mg once a day by my doctor when my BP was 140/90. I used it for about one month but went back to the doctor when it gave me terrible headaches and back ache. So I was told to switch to Aldactone 25mg. After 2 weeks of using the Aldactone; my BP got back to 120/80 for the next one month after taking the Aldactone. Meanwhile; my eye doctor gave me Diamox and Slow-K for one week in the last of my taking Aldactone.My doctor asked me to stop the drug 6 days ago since my BP is back to normal. However; I have been experiencing numbness in the right side of my body (from head to toe!) and especially at night and/or when I lie down or am asleep. I wake up in the night to ease myself and am notice the numbness and fear grips me. For 2 nights; I have trembled uncontrollably on that same right side of my body At times I feel breathless and my chest feels tight. Most worrisome is the fuzzy feeling in the right side of my head that I try to ignore all day. Please; what's happening? Are these side effects of stopping the Aldactone? Am a 41 -year old woman. Kindly help me with answers to these issues of concern. Tina.,2012,2012,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels "weaker" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks,2008,2008,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi! I'm new to this forum and have a question for you. I just had a complete blood workup done and everything was great except my GFR was only 55 and was flagged.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello I'm 28 years old; male. I had a bout of atrial fib once a few months ago. I had it for maybe two or three hours. I think it was stress that caused it. It had been building up for a while. My ER doc. said he wasn't going to give me meds because I was young and would probably never have the problem again. I had an echocardiogram later in that month and everything was normal according to the report. Atria were normal size. Blood ejection volume was normal etc. I also had a heart event monitor which showed no atrial fib for the month after my episode. My GP doctor (not a heart specialist) said that he was happy with the results and decided not to do anything. I'm on 81mg of aspirin and also atenolol for high blood pressure. My cholestrol test are very good; and I have no diabetes. I am still very worried about stroke though. I have seen a lot of horror stories online about younger people having strokes. What is my risk for stroke? I don't think I've been in atrial fib since that one time. I'm also wondering how doctors decide what meds for clots to put you on? Is it age? and underlying heart disease? High Cholestrol? When is warfarin used and when is just aspirin used? Is 81 mg of aspirin enough for someone in my situation? Also if I have had atrial fib once in the past is it a good idea to get checked for it again? How often? These questions have been lingering in my head and I have had a lot of anxiety over them. Any answers would be great! Thanks for your help! ~Matt,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My daughter was put on a beta blocker one month ago for test anxiety to be taken as needed. She is in college; 19 yrs old. We have noticed her behavior has changed from fairly nice to obnoxious this past month. It could be boyfriend issue (he is done with college and leaving for home). I started wondering if this could be a side effect from the medication. I am not familiar with beta blockers; have done searches but I want to ask medhelp is anyone else has experienced a side effect similar to this. ~El,2008,2009,47,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,How common is it for a 46 year old female to develop Heart failure...or Pulmonary Hypertension... can you explain the differences? I am very overweight and on Atenolol originally for the benign palpitations ive had for 20 years; but also for high BP..at my yearly physical 4 months ago; my BP was 122/72. (controlled excellently on the atenolol) I have generalized anxiety that manifests as shortness of breath and palps. I was checked out as recent as a year ago in the ER for palps;complete heart workup-xray; bloodwork-ekg...and like always;for past 20 years have been told they were benign. Since Ive gained weight I notice an increase in the shortness of breath;when I first start moving around--sometimes it goes away and I notice my ankles swell some-I have an 8 hour a day sitting at the computer fulltime job. They go down completly overnight. The shortness of breath concerns me; but yet It seems to be more anxiety related; because if I forget to "Worry" about it; I dont seem to have it. In a year; could my shortness of breath become something serious?,2007,2007,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth Anderson on February 26; 1998 at 01:45:04: I am a 47 year old female who is severely obese. I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart? Thanks in advance for your time and advice.,1998,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had hypertension for several years and have trouble with side effects from meds. I have been taking Clonidine and Atenolol. Since taking the clonidine since March I have felt strange sensations in my chest and also gained 10 pounds in two weeks. I have been back to the Internal Medicine physician several times because of this. Last week as I was walking in the park up a steep hill; I became short of breath and dizzy. I had a hard time breathing. I went to the do again and he gave me Valturna in additon to the other drugs. The breathing problem continued where I could not catch my breath. On Sunday I felt this weird sensation in my body and again could not breath. The electrocardiogram showed extra beats and it was recommeded that I get a holter monitor. The results were pvc s and pac s. Knowing that I have a hard time with meds; he said just to continue the meds. Valturna 150 mg; clonidine 0.1 mg twice a day and Atenolol 25 mg twice daily. I feel like a zombie in the corner. Is it necessary to take this much medication. Also my bp was hard to control on the clonidine and Atenolol. This discussion is related to Are PVC's � PAC's Really benign or can they lead to future problems?.,2010,2010,64,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post. I appreciate your time & help.,2012,2012,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,I have fainted with almost no warning on 4 occasions over the last few months. In each case I have quickly regained consciousness without any lasting effects. On two occasions this occurred in public shortly after a meal; which scared my fellow diners. On the other two occasions it was at home; once in the bathroom; and the other while working at my computer. The pattern seems to be first a feeling of dizziness; I am sweating profusely and feeling generally unsteady. The onset in rapid and I black out completely within the next one to two minutes. On one occasion I was aware of tunnel vision a few seconds before fainting. I am told that I regain consciousness quite fast once I am on the floor; in any event enough to head off those around me from calling an ambulance. Although I can't know this from my own experience; I guess that we must be talking around 30 seconds of unconsciousness. When I come to at first I have no knowledge of where I am or how I got there. I am feeling quite contented with no pain. Full feeling and awareness quickly return; probably within one to two minutes; although I never actually remember the point of passing out. Once I have recovered I feel perfectly fine; no pain; no shortage of breath; normal heartbeat etc. The only symptom is a slight headache. On one occasion I took my blood pressure shortly afterwards. The reading was slightly low at 110/65. I take Atenolol for hypertension (v. effective). I am 47; male. I am concerned lest this is symptomatic of some kind of intermittent heart problem.,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Going to Doc: please comment The left atrium was approaching the upper limits of normal size at 3.90 cm. The left ventricle is normal in size at 3.95 cm; with a systolic dimension of 3.90 cm. The left ventricle demonstrates moderate hypertrophy. The left ventricular wall; including the septum; altered its size and shape normally and moved appropriately in systole and diastole. There was no evidence of segmental wall motion abnormality. The estimated ejection fraction is 85%. The mitral valve shows mild annular calcification. The valvular leaflets appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or prolapse. Doppler studies of the mitral valve reveal evidence of trace mitral insufficiency; and the prominent A wave noted on Doppler inflow suggests decreased left ventriclular compliance. The right atrium and right ventricle; including inflow and outflow tracts; appeared normal. The aortic valve shows annular calcification with mile calcification of the aortic valve cusps. The valvular cusps appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or insufficiency. There is a measured transvalvular gradient of 6.11 mm of mercury across the valve; which is clinically insignificant for stenosis. The tricuspid and pulmonic valves were normal with evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency and mild pulmonic insufficiency on Doppler study. There were no vegetations seen on any valve. No intracavity masses or thrombi were noted. There was no evidence of pericardial infusion. Conclusion: Left atrial size approached the upper limits of normal. Normmal left ventricular chanber size with moderate concentric hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 85%. Mitral sclerosis with trace mitral insufficiency and a Doppler inflow pattern suggestive of decreased left ventricular compliance. Aortic sclerosis with no evidence of significant valvular dysfunction. Mild tricuspid insuffiency. Mild pulmonic insufficiency.,2009,2009,59,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,hi i am a 29 year old male overweight about 60 pounds i had an episode of afib about 8 months ago;had all the tests run everything was unremarkable;so the cardio put me on 50 mg of atenolol 2 times a day havent had any problems since;i went to my gp and had a physical everything was fine but my bp reading then was 149/84;he said to come back in a month to recheck i just went back and my reading was 153/84;and he said i should try hydrochlorothiazide;in terms a water pill i guess;my question is could that episode of afib been because i high blood pressure?;i have talked to a dr friend of the family and he told me that reading of 153/84 doesnt warrent meds?also isnt atenolol a high bp med? should i be on both?or should i even be on any? i am confused dont want to take pills if i dont have to thank you,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my ?? I had an echo done nearly 5 years ago ; it showed only borderline hypertrophy; I had a echo done this past Tuesday which the cardio said had progressed from borderline to mild; a change of about 2mm if I remember correctly; B/P was 140/85 in the doc's office; at home every time I take it is always control around 115/70 most of the time. He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate. Thanks.,2005,2005,40,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have ALWAYS had a rather low blood pressure; anywhere from 90/50 to 110/65; they used to not let me donate blood because the b/p would be too low. Of course; I was younger then. Now I am a 41 yr old woman. My family history includes everybody with high blood pressure. Lately I've not been feeling too well; I've had lots of periods of tachycardia and shortness of breath and PVCs as many as every other beat; but echo showed a normal heart so I am not to worry. However because of the continued chest pain with exercise that resolves with rest; a family history of heart disease; a new murmur heard at the exam; and continued mild tachycardia at rest; they decided to do a Cardiolite stress test and do a new echo....fully believing it to be nothing but just to be safe. The thing I don't understand is lately I've had periods of wide blood pressure elevation. Please note I have never had "white coat hypertension" before. Nonetheless my b/p has been 185/120; 175/110; 170/90 on at least three occasions in doctors offices. I have recorded it on several occasions at grocery stores in the neighborhood of 145-155 / 85-95 using the automatic blood pressure machines. By the same token; just as often it is 126-139 / 76-90. Is there any significance to this variability? The doctors have generally not commented on the pressure taken in their offices when it was so high except that once asked if I was nervous. Usually the nurse will say your blood pressure seems to be high today and then the doctor comes and looks at the chart and says nothing. For now I am assuming that since a good portion of the time it appears the blood pressure is within normal range; that means it is ok? Do you concur?,1999,1999,,

After my son was born in '00; I began experiencing momentary dizziness. I had a holter monitor for 48 hrs; nothing weird showed up. I had my first syncope episode this summer; at a dance class. I had fallen and sprained my ankle; and 10 min later; I passed out. The squad was called and my pulse was irregular and my EKGs were abnormal. I went to the dr. the next day; they did another ekg; I showed sinus bradycardia. Normally not an issue but I had passed out. Plus; I'm not in great shape. I take 1 hr of dance a week (aerobic exercise) and that's all; and for both my pregnancies I was confined to bed for preterm labor for 4 and 7 months respectively. They did a tilt table test; It was neg; but as the meds wore off I did note that I skipped/paused my heartrate a lot. Since that first syncope episode I've had 4-5 episodes of near syncope. I've not had a fully normal ekg since then either. It either shows sinus tachy; sinus brady or sinus arrhythmia. All of these combined have me puzzled. I've been tested for so much because of my weight issues; and the first dr. I saw was just convinced I stood up too fast when I passed out (even though I was sitting with my feet elevated) I see a new cardiologist in 3 weeks; but is there anything I should ask them about? I think an event monitor is the next course of action; but does this sound typical of anything? Could my pregnancies and/or the bedrest from my pregnancies contributed to this?,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My daughter had her gall bladder removed last Friday and left the hospital the next day. Yesterday. Thursday; she was rushed to the ER after being dizzy for days and BP of 172/105; heart rate 82. Blood and urine tests were ok; chest xrays and ekg were ok. She was released; without medication; with the direction to see the surgeon that did the gall bladder removal. Today her BP is 135/105 with heart rate of 80-85 ------- She feels the surgery is the problem. I feel a cardiologist is the only one that will help. She will be calling her surgeon as the ER advised. Any thoughts ?,2006,2006,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I have been getting runs of bigeminys lasting up to an hour all day long. They will start with a hard skip and continue. I do get a break in between; but lasting no more than half an hour. This has been going on for a month. My cardiologist wants to put me on tambacor; .50mg twice a day. I'm a little afraid to go on that pill. What is your opinion of tambacor? I take atenolol now; .50mg a day ( cut in half twice a day.) Also I take avapro 150mg daily. Also I take synthroid .112mg. Atenolol does nothing for me but slow my heart down. I have been plagued with heart skips for 20 years. Been through every test possible; and tried everything possible. Nothing works. I know I can't continue this way. It is leaving me paralyzed with fear. Any suggestions? Do you think I could wean myself off of the atenolol? I have been taking it for many years. Ablation is out; too many horror stories about that. Do you think the slow heart beat (56 to 62) could be a culprit? I just want my life back; I'm so depressed. Thanks for listening.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at? (upper 140's/70-80's) Thanks K :-) Have a wonderful day!!! Merry Christmas everyone,2003,2003,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 30 year old female. Since June of this year; I have been experiencing a rapid heart beat. The first time it hapeened I was in bed sleeping!! but it usually occurrs after eating. My heart rate goes anywhere between 100 - 130 bpm and stays there sometimes for a couple hours. I've had an echo done; which was normal (right ventricle was not well visualized; however); ekgs; blood work and an event monitor that I wore for 21 days. My doctor says its not a rythym problem. Possibly anxiety. I take xanax .5 milligrams 2x a day. I have a prescription for a beta blocker; but i havent filled it yet. I dont like taking meds much. I have a family history of heart attacks (maternal grandmother) and my mother has a history of MVP (although she recently got an echo done which did not show MVP and her cardiologist said that the criteria for MVP has changed) so now she's not sure whether she has it; but for years she was told she did. Anyway; my questions are: 1) What is the difference between sinus tach and SVT? would they show up differently on an EKG? 2) How fast is too fast for a heart rate? 3) although my echo was normal; my doctor hears a click when he listens to my heart. if echo was normal; what could the click be from?? 4) kind of off fast heartrates; but I also have a pounding in my chest when standing to quickly or stretching; not like a fast beat; more like a slow; hard beat that lasts for a couple seconds. Is this normal? sorry this post is so long. I'm kind of obsessing over my heart these days. thanks.,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a IDDM; female; 42 years old who has been battling high blood pressure for about 4 years. I now take an ACE Inhibiter; Beta Blocker and a Calcuim Blocker. I have started to try to fit in exercise but only manage to get in 30 min 3X per week. My blood pressure now has periods of low to normal when I am at home; relaxing quietly (100 - 130/65-85). When I am at a doctors appointment or check my pressure at the grocery store; it is high (130-170/90-95). These tend to be stressful times for me. What are the pressure readings of a person who typically has normal blood pressure readings when they are under stress? Thanks!,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for taking my question. I have been reading that PACs and PVCs are benign in the setting of a structurely sound heart. I have CAD and a 5 graft CABG but have had no heart attacks or heart damage. Does that mean that the PACs and PVCs that I have are benign? In other words; is someone who has CAD and no heart damage considered to have a structurely sound heart? Thanks again.,2006,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I just had a stress test because I have WPW. My WPW went away during exercise; but my doctor said that I had extremely high blood pressure during the test. Is this anything that I should worry about?,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Is there a reason for concern if your heart rate consistently remains between 80-100? PB stays consistent at about 140/80 male; age 56; with high stress job - MUCH job related turmoil Other than the heart rate - health would be considered excellent.,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed as mildly hypertensive a few years ago (now 47 y/o; ns; nd; normal weight and lipid profile). I ran about 150-160/90's before; now run 130-140/mid-upper 80s on 20 mg Lisinopril qd. I feel like this isn't low enough. I recently had an MRI/MRA of my head for unrelated reasons; and the report came back with changes "most consistent of involutional small vessel white matter changes beyond upper limits of normal for patients age. Consider small vessel ischemic risk factors such as untreated hypertension." Does this mean I need better control of my hypertension? When I am at rest or in the docs office; it is always about 120-130/mid-low 80's. At work; however (night shift RN; busy unit) it runs 140-150/mid to upper 80's to 90. My pulse is rarely lower than mid 90's (80's at rest). Thyroid functions ok. My doc says not to worry; that this is fine. I say that as I work fulltime; my BP's at work reflect my usual state more than resting or office BP's. My family history includes several relatives with longstanding hypertension; stroke; MI; and aortic stenosis. What is your opinion? Aim for lower; or ok as is? What would be the next usual agent to add if a lower BP would be desirable?,2004,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I went in for a pre-op for total knee replacement surgery and was sent for an EKG which came back abnormal .My doc will not o.k. the surgery until I have a Dobutimine stress test to rule out heart disease .I am scheduled for the stress test this Thursday and a bit nervouse .I am 51; female; overweight and take 25 mg Atenolol daily for hypertension .

Atenolol+hypertension,In 1994; at the age of 15; I began having what was thought to be panic attacks by me and my parents. These episodes would generally last an hour; and would include palpitations and shortness of breath. In January 1997; after having several episodes lasting greater than 3 hours each; I was diagnosed with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome; and then mitral valve prolapse once an echo was performed. I was seen by a pediatric Electrophysiologist (Dr. Sterba) at the Cleveland Clinic. An RF Ablation was performed in May of that year. Everything was great for about a year; at which time I started experiencing sinus tachycardia with hypertension. Resting HR of 120-140; resting BP of 180/120. I went back to Cleveland; was put on beta blockers with the hopes of weaning me off of them and doing futher testing to determine why I was tachy. My EKG looked normal; with no delta wave present. I could not tolerate being weaned off of the beta blocker; and was left on it; at the same dose (50mg Atenolol) for about 2 years. This dose stopped holding me for 24 hours; and so I increased myself to 75mg/day (50mg qam; 25mg qpm). I did this only until I could get in to see my family physician. He changed me to 100mg Toprol XL qday. This only worked for about 12 hours however; then I was once again experiencing tachycardia. My dose was increased to 100mg bid. This seemed to keep my heart rate down; but my htn persisted at a low level (140/110). I was placed on Cozaar; 50mg qday; about a year later for the htn; but it persisted; at about the same level. Once I started seeing a cardiologist again; I was placed on 100mg Cozaar. A year later; after a follow up visit to my cardiologist; I was then placed on 100/12.5mg Hyzaar qday. I was instructed that my BP was to stay below 120/80. This final med has accomplished that. I have been in the 100/60 range for some time now; which has taken a while to get used to. I guess I was just wondering if there is anyone out there who has had a similar experience; and if they every had a definitive diagnosis? I've never been told exactly why my heart does what it does or why my BP is what it is. Any information would be greatly appreciated. I've diagnosed myself with inappropriate sinus tachycardia....but; I don't know.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 33 years old Male and a working executive in MNC. Right side upper lip numbness happened about 2 years ago gradually going upwards to cover the right cheek and nose part. Headeache also happened during the numbness. The period of numbness was half an hour and repeated about 4 times in 2 months. The timing of the occurence is same everytime that is after morning bath with hot water and at the rise of winters. I underwent the brain MRI; MRA; Heart related tests like LIPID profile; ECHO; etc. and everything was normal except a sign of sinusitis on right side. The numbness is repeated after 2 years now and it lasted for about 2-3 hours now; covering same area and happened at same time. The numbness covered right side upper lip; tooth jaw; right cheek and right side of the nose. Now again the brain MRI is normal. My neurologist said it is a general anxiety disorder. It is not TIA as MRI is normal even after 2 years. I want to check with you on that. Also want to check if migraine can cause one sided face numbness along with headache and what is the cure. By nature; I become anxious at times; worrying about petty things; etc. I am still wondering what is causing the numbness and that too lasting for more than 2 hours now. Is it a migraine? or GAD? or Sinusitus? OR something else? I also have a Hypertension history for about 5 years and currently on Atenolol 50 mg. My BP is mostly under control with the medication. No abnormal blood test reports till now.,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have high blood pressure. One year ago I was put on Accupril. Three months later I was switched to Lisinopril due to an insurance change. In May of '99 while driving to work; my heart began beating very hard. I could hear it beating in my head and it felt as if it could beat out of my chest. It was followed by two brief black-outs. Fortunately I made it to the side of the road without hurting anyone. I felt nauseated and had a very dry mouth. At the ER they gave me an EKG and a brain scan. When they determined nothing was seriously wrong with me they let me go. My doctor had me quit taking high blood pressure medication for awhile and see how I did. I was off of them for about 6 months when I started getting blood pressure headaches again. He then put me on 25 mg of Atenolol. I found immediate relief in headaches and my blood pressure went down. Two days ago while sitting at my desk at work; the heart started its hard beating again and I felt as if I could black out; but I did not. I stood up and walked for a minute and it went away. Neither episode occured during a stressful situation. Two doctors have told me that nothing can be done and that we can't know what it is unless we catch it while its happening. My fear is that I could black out again while driving and hurt not only myself but someone else. Has anyone heard anything like this? If so; what could be the problem? My doctor said the irregular rythms are normal; but he really didn't have an answer for the blacking out. I thought maybe my blood pressure was going to low; but he said no. I would appreciate any advice I could get. Thank you.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I apologize for this loaded question. I'm 31 year old female;complex arrhythmia hist primarily atrial tachys SVT;WPW?; including atrial fib. I've had 4 EP studies; 3 with ablation. Tachys persist. AV node ablated; given unipolar pacemaker with single lead; later upgraded to bipolar with two leads; but original lead was left in. Have 3 wires. Echo last year was determined abnormal due to mild pulmonary hypertension with right vent and right atrial enlargement. Had moderate tricuspid regurg. Cardiologist here suggested I see a pulm hyperten specialist; but also suggested my pacemaker system could be contributing to my problem. I have become progressively worse with shortness of breath. With exertion I get jaw pain; nausea and dizziness. Cardiologist here says he isn't sure what to do. I recently went to another "Best Hospital" for evaluation and opinion (not yours). Had myoview stress test; showed some decrease in bloodflow in an area of my heart that resolved with rest. I went through cardiac cath. Early into procedure I had vent fibrillation. They said my arteries looked fine; but I had dyskinesia of my right vent. They planned to test for coronary art spasm; but abandoned it. They mentioned med Coreg; but abandoned it. Though they wanted to help me at first; after the cath they dumped me as patient with no further care. No pacer check for over 6 hours since defib; unmonitored. Discharged that afternoon completely alone. Devastated. I am a patient that medical centers just don't want. I feel I should just stop pursuing this. Comments; suggestions most appreciated. Thanks,2002,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the ISV 14mm; all other measurements are within the normal limits; EF 55%; overall my other heart measurements though within the normal limits are on the smaller side; I've been told I have a very powerful heart. I'm 5'9" approximately 195 lbs. about 30 lbs overweight accordong to BMI even though my cardio tells me I'm really only about 15lbs overweight because of my built. I used to suffer PVCs and hypertension; but rarely have PVCs anymore; I'm on atenolol 100mg; cozaar 25mg BID; and HCTC 12.5mg. B/P well controlled 105/60 to 90/55 are usually my reading these days. I read on another post recently that a 13mm wall measurement of the heart would not be considered LVH in a very large person; I thought that even 13-15mm in well conditioned athletes sometimes raised concern; most doctors have told me LVH is not a good thing even when mild.My latest ECG 1 month ago did not suggest LVH like the old ones; I know its not the gold standard in diagnosing LVH; but Do you think it is possible it could have regressed through aggressive treatment? When speaking of PVCs in the setting of a structurally normal being benign and not leading to SCD; would mild LVH like mine with everything thing else within the normal limits fall into the same category as being benign and not making one more prone to dangerous arrhythmias and SCD? I've learned to deal with the anxieties my PVCs have caused me and still learning coping methods to deal with them even better ; they dont scare me anymore like before; but with mild LVH; I still wonder and these ?s Tks,2005,2006,41,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the IVS; all other dimensions within normal limits last echo in mid 2005 showed an IVS of 14mm EF 55% no leakages of the valves; the cardiologist describes the jets as perfect whatever that means; I was in rush to catch a flight back and forgot to ask; though he assured me that I don't have HCM. I was mild hypertensive for years but is controlled with atenolol 100mg daily cozaar 25mg twice daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily; BP been averaging around 105/65 for couple of years now. In 2001 echo showed borderline LVH with dimensions ofthe IVS 10mm to12mm; with an of EF 65-70%; same cardio ; same echo machine. I was supposed to get an echo this year but due to unforseen events had to skip; Do you think with the info provided its is reasonable to wait another year? I'm 43 years old male and been a sufferer of tachycardia & PVcs all my life but all test was negative including echo; stress test and holter ; I rarely have PVCs anymore and no tachycardia at all; Does the diagnosis of Mild LVH put me at any significant increased risk for Sudden cardiac events? I also have ankylosing spondylitis; do you think that could be a contributing factor for LVH?; I know it can affect the aortic valve and conduction systems in a small % of persons with Ankylosing spondylitis.

Atenolol+hypertension,I am 31 year old male and my series of problem started in May'07 on one of the evenings when I felt something like a signal passed to my head from stomach and felt dizzy. I became panic and went to see my family doctor (I have been on medication for primary hypertension for last 4 years). Blood tests; ECG etc has been conducted and nothing found wrong. He told me not to worry but I had started getting dizziness once in a while and I became very anxious about it. I also had a mild frontal headache and muscle weakness. Then I realized that I started getting panic when I face public in functions; taking flight journeys; worrying that I might faint. I went to see a neurologist in July'07 and after the physical excercise test; he told me nothing to worry; however I had insisted for an MRI. The MRI with contrast done in July07 (of brain with multiplanar T1w; T2w; FLAIR; GRE; DWI and post-gadolinium sequences) was perfect and no abnormalities found except presence of paranasal sinusitis (I have seen an ENT and polyps has been found in the frontal sinus. Subsequent CT scan showed my frontal sinus are filled with white matter and I am supposed to go for an operation to remove polyps). I was happy with the MRI results; however the dizziness episode and the frontal headache started disturbing me again in Sep'07 and my family doctor gave me antibiotics to clear the infection in sinuses. After three weeks of antibiotics course; the frontal headache was better; however I felt the dizziness; unbalanceness and weakness (especially on right side of the body) once in a while and I went to see the neurologist again in Dec'07 explaining my difficulties (Dizziness; numbness; unbalance; mild frontal headahe (especially above eyes); muscle weakness on left hand and leg; seeing floaters; anxiety; etc.). After conducting the physical tests; he told me nothing to worry and given me a tablet "Lyrica 75 mg daily". I have started taking it for last two weeks and there is a slight improvement in the numbness of my left leg and hand. When I asked my neuro on whether there is a need for MRI again; he told me re-scanning is not required at all and the recent MRI conducted in July'07 was perfect. My neuro is one of the leading specialists in my city. I am confused and I would like to request for a second opinion from the panel of doctors. Thank you.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 30yr/m and have had high blood pressure for the past 4-5 years. I currently take 25mg Atenolol once daily. My blood pressure is normally around 130/85 or so. Over the past 4 days I have been experiencing; what I believe are; panic attacks. I had some bad anxiety issues a few years ago; and the symptoms are very similar. During these attacks my blood pressure sky rockets. I check it yesterday after having one of these attacks and the reading was 165/110. Im quite sure it was much higher when I was actually having the symptoms since I was feeling much better at the time I took the reading. I think part of the fuel for the continued anxiety is the fear that I am going to have a stroke due to the sudden increase in blood pressure during the anxiety attacks. I have an appointment scheduled with my Dr. for this afternoon. My question is this: Is my fear that I could have a stroke due to my blood pressure getting so high during one these episodes legitimate or am I just worrying myself more? I have read different information that this sudden increase in blood pressure could cause a stroke; and then other which say that is not true; and that it takes many years of high blood pressure to cause a stroke to occur. I suppose i am afraid that my blood pressure will get too high during one of these episodes and a stroke will occur. Thank you,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I went yesterday for cataract surgery; this was canceled. My heat rate was 36 to 50 bpm; with pvc's about every 3rd beat. I have had a very low heart rate for at least 10 years; (39 to 44 bpm; resting) and a "heart murmer" since 12 years old; I'm now 74. I take Enalapril (5 mG); Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mG); and Lovastatin (30mG). My regular Dr wanted a second opinion before he would OK the cataract surgery. I went to a cardiac specialist who gave me an "echo cardiograph" and a stress test; on meeting with him a week later he classified me as "a low risk for the surgery". No mention was made of the pvc's at all; and he did take an EKG. When I took the stress test my heart rate went from 42 (resting) to 124bpm; and all was pronounced OK. I did not experience any feeling for the pvc's at all. What should I do to correct this problem? What medications are suggested? Could the stress test have started this pvc episode?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe L3-L4 and L4-L5 stenosis. The MRI report also indicated moderate foraminal narrowing at 3 or 4 disc levels; and the report mentioned desiccation at all but one of the disc levels. The L4-L5 also indicated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet athrosis. What does this mean? 34 years - 6 foot 4 inches; 230 lbs. I have episodic numbness and pain in legs; but also have this problem in arms and hands too (numbness and slight tremor). I also have abdominal pains (mostly ULQ) and fluctuation in stool. I don't smoke or drink. I'm on paxil (mood); lisinopril and small dose of atenolol (hypertension). I have taken paxil and lisinopril for years. I had two ablations for SVT in 2006 - second one caused a PE which I took warfarin for 6 months. No clotting factors. The numbness started in my legs and affects my hands and forearms as well. Sometimes I feel this squeezing feeling either in my hands or in my lower back. When I sit for long periods and then stand up and walk I sometimes get episodes of numbness and weakness that make me have to walk slow and/or sit down and rest. Also I get some strange sensations in my hands and forearms...like holding a phone my hand gets tense and heavy and I have to switch hands. Also; both arms fall "asleep" at night; and I am not laying on them. I have a stiff/aching neck for over a year that waxes and wanes; but stays sore all the time. I have had several workups before the MRI. I have normal cbc; liver blood tests; mri of head; abdominal ct; no lyme; b12; no hepatitis; no cmv; blood smear neg pathogens; etc. Normal ncv/emg Could the arm involvement indicate some cervical stenosis? Can lumbar stenosis to affect the arms? Also; the digestive issues - testing (colonoscopy; endoscopy; etc) is normal. Could this stenosis cause this? Are there any diseases that cause the stenosis or cause a more rapid degeneration of my discs? Thank you,2006,2008,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Mom 72; Singapore. Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) Daily BP: B4 breakfast - 140 PM & eve- 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Back in December I felt a tightness in my chest and went to the doctor thinking I had a cold coming on. During the visit the doctor found my pulse to be fast (120). She sent me for an ECG which showed my pulse to be normal. They than sent me for a stress test and once again my pulse was high; but everything else was fine. The put me on beta blockers at this point to slow the rate of my heart and set up an echo. The echo showed my EF to be 35%. They have no idea what is causing my EF to be so low. I am a 26 year old female; fairly active; non-smoker; I drink a few times a year; normal cholestoral; not diabetic; slim build; low-normal blood pressure. I met with another doctor who has since put me on a second drug for hypertension. Both drugs low my blood pressure which is already boardline low. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I can expect or be doing now. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've been sort of stressing out about all of this as until Decemeber I considered myself to be a very healthy person. I feel completely blindsided by all of this.,2010,2010,26,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I was recently put on a beta blocker for my hypertension. I also starting exercising again after 5 years. I am 43 years old with a 4 yr old and a 18 month old. I can't get my heart rate up enough to see any benefits of the exercise after 1 month. I sweat; but I never get to the 'fat burning' level. Do I need an alternative medication? What are my options?

Atenolol+hypertension,I had tests run on the following dates. Cat Scan in November showed 2 small renal cysts. I'm wondering first about the low GFR and (since the creatinine went up after the scan) if the dye Isovue could have affected it. Second; could the low hemoglobin and symptoms of anemia (fatigue; cold hands/feet; weakness; palpitations) be related to the low GFR and kidneys. (Iron deficiency anemia seems to be ruled out since I have hemochromatosis and my iron overload should prevent that along with all tests to check for any bleeding have come back negative.) My history is hypertension and taking atenolol and lisinopril...No evidence of diabetes Lab results for Nov/08 Jul09 Creatinine 1.3 1.6 GFR -- 44.8 (first time tested) Hemoglobin 12.4 11.8,2009,2009,56,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everybody; Ok im a 23 year old male; weigh 290 but have been losing weight (i was 326 now im 290) i was diagnosed with High Blood Pressure about 6 months ago; i was running at about 160/85; Im taking metropolol 75 mg; bennicar 20 mg altough i was taking 25 mg of atenolol before the cardiologist put me on metropolol instead. Ive been having constant chest pain around my chest area; soetimes right in the middle or on the left side or left side by my ribcage. Its very disconcerning because each episode last about a couple seconds and is a sharp almost stabbing pain. My doctor has ahad blood work done on me and they found high cholesterol and slightly abnormal liver functions; it used to be that i had these pains maybe once or twice a week but now its daily; ive gone to the urgent care 5 times; er 2 times; etc; they all did ekg's and they all came back negative. Ive seen a cardiologist who did a ecchocardiogram and a stress test revealed nothing; my primary doctor also did a ct scan of my abdomen and pelvis and ct scan of my chest; also revealing nothing abnormal. I sometimes get this weird feeling of fullness around my nipple area wich is disconcerning. All doctors that have seen me have ruled out any heart problems; no mvp; no arrythmyas but it seems like its always around my chest area sometimes it might originate from the middle of my chest an feel it go trough to my back. The other thing i have noticed is when i go to slep at night it seems like i cnt sleep; and when i wake up my heart is pounding like if i just ran a marathon. Any suggestions?? i know i am overweight bu im fiting the battle of the bulge but should hypertension be giving me pains like these?,2009,2009,22,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Im 47 yr old very overweight female. I have yearly physicals..just had one a few days ago. Have generalized anxiety..panic attacks. Hypertension..although am on Atenolol; which keeps my bp nearly normal...last Thurs it was 120/80.. recently developed GERD....and am on prilosec for that...other than that; and being overweight...oh; and have benign palpitations that Ive had for 20 years...other than those things; Im really healthy. Ive talked to my Dr and she is all for me starting a walking exercise program. UGH. But I am serious about doing it. The thing is..about a week ago ( before I started walking) I notice when I walk even a short distance...or when I take the basement stairs up; I get a tightness in my chest..not really my chest though..more in my stomach area...in the center..at the base of my breastbone..not between the breasts even.Slightly below that area. Its weird. I do not have it when Im sitting still--and since this is one of my personal symtoms of anxiety...I have been just ignoring it...as much as I can. When I started my walking program on Friday...wow; when i walked the first half block ..it felt like I had a brick there..in that area..but the more I walked..the less I felt it. At the end of my walk..I have no chest tightness at all..that whole feeling is gone. I cant even say that when Im having that tightness; that I am short of breath; because I am NOT really. No pain of any kind...its just like somebody blew up a balloon inside me; in that area...how weird; huh? Almost exactly a year ago to today; I had a complete cardiac workup..echo; ekg...stress test...because of the palpitations..and everything was perfect. I wonder...do I need to have a whole new cardiac workup? Do I just keep on my walking program; and if any other symptom ( ex- pain; dizzy; etc) shows up then call? this feeling unnerves me...and so of course my anxiety has a good hold of me during this time.... so now..I am basically expecting to feel that way anytime I get up and walk across the room... I really want to be serious about my exercise program; and getting this weight off... help...,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,45 yo male. treated for hypertension for 20 yrs. two months ago started waking up with tachycardia when I changed to another generic brand of nadolol (20mg). also take lisinopril 10 mg. internist put me on cardionet 14 day monitor - showed pvcs and 6 beat run of v tach. so he doubled the nadolol which made the pvcs worst - plus had numbness of left foot and dizziness. went to cardiologist - did a 10 min thall stress to 140 hr bpm had no pvcs and good heart function. also had normal echo. still at rest was getting tachycardia with nadolol. went to ep; he changed me to acebutolol 200mg. now i cant even walk on the treadmill without getting pvcs when i use to run 30 minutes w/o them. other history...had a fib in 2006 after prescribed adderol - cardioverted. took rhythmol had massive pvcs and promptly discontinued. also in 2001 took atenolol - had pvcs until being switched to toprol xl. question: could the beta blocker meds be causing my rhythm problems? could i just do without them? note: a year ago i was running 4 miles a day 3 days a week and swimming a mile two days a week on 20mg nadolol 10mg lisinopril with no problems.,2010,2010,45,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question I hope someone will be able to answer. In the next few months I am hoping to receive a class 1 medical clearance for employment purposes. I was diagnosed with SVT in July 2007; but it is now perfectly controlled with medicine (atenolol; which I also take to control my high blood pressure). It was only diagnosed as I was going through an extremely stressful time in my life and was having roughly 10 small arrythmia episodes per day which prompted me to see a cardiologist . Since then; I have maybe 2-3 a month that last 5 seconds or less. They are more of a nuisance than anything else. My cardiologist never seems concerned about it. I know that medical clearances are granted for controlled hypertension; so I am not worried about that part of my medical history. But I am a bit nervous I will be denied because of my SVT. Does anyone know if medical clearances are typically denied for people with SVT; even if it is controlled with medication? Many thanks for any input.,2010,2010,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,hello. Something very scary happened at 3am this morning my mom sat up in bed and was going to go the the toilet to pee like she always does and then her stomach felt weired; and she passed out; my dad was unable to wake her; he checked for breathing she was breathing; he called 911; when she came to she the last thing she remembered was sitting on the edge of her bed. she went to ER by ambulance; where they found she was hypotensive and tachycardic; they took blood everything was fine except her potassium and sodium were both markedly low. They assumed she was dehydrated; but she drinks a lot of water. This is unusual becuase my mom has been hyPERtenstive for as long as I can remember and takes 100mg of atenolol and 25mg of HCTZ every day becuase without it her BP would be dangerously high and she has a history of hypertension and stroke on her side of the family. She also has never passed out in her life; she will be 62 in june. She also takes a daily calcium supplement; a multivite and fish oil. her ekg was fine but they are keeping her overnight and are going to also do an echo and some other tests. she also had a fever of 101.2 and they just gave her tylenol and ibuprofin I am also worried becuase she was an avid user of darvon (not darvocet with tylenol; just darvon) and took it for a long time for her artritis pain. in novemeber the FDA removed it from the market due to cardiac risks. But I was reading about the recall; and on several sites including webmd they quoted Gerald Dal Pan; MD; MHS; director of the FDA's office of surveillance and epidemiology saying; "Long-term users should not worry: The heart effects are not cumulative;" he says. "Once people stop using propoxyphene; the side (should go away." I am really worried (becuase she's my mom shes my rock shes my everything and thats what I do) does anyone feel like playing doctor for me? any ideas why this is happening? does it sound like an infection? or auto immune? or did she actually maybe have a heart attack? or a reaction to something she ingested? also; she is a visiting nurse and goes into half a dozen sick peoples houses every day and also sees patients in assisted living homes. please maybe throw out some ideas I am just really scared and worried I love my mom more than anyone else in this whole world she is the most selfless person and if anything bad happened to her now; I don't know how I would go on living. she was fine yesterday and last night when she went to bed. thanks,2009,2011,24,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,i went to a new doctor today and got an EKG and the machine interpreted it as Wide QRS Tachycardia. my heart rate was 159 and the QRS was 220. i feel my heart racing a lot. i do not exercise at all because of this. to anyone who knows;can you tell me;is this dangerous or can i still keep taking 100mg on atenolol a day? thanks.,2011,2011,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 23 year old male; in generally good health except that I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. I am a high-stress individual. The problem started when I noticed every time I had even a sip of coffee I felt like I was going to pass out. This was strange because I drank coffee heavily since I was probably 12 or so. This began about 3 months after I quit using cocaine; which I had used for about 9 - 11 months. Not something I'm proud of but that's the way it is. I have since been to a cardiologist; and had an echo-cardiogram; various blood tests (to check for ACS and clots; thyroid; etc.); chest CT; 24 - hour monitor and will have a stress test in a couple of days. I have been taking atenolol for about 6 months or so now; with moderate success. But; I still cannot have even more than a taste of coffee; or any caffeinated product. I used to smoke marijuana regularly with no problems and only in the last few months have I also become unable to do this as well. Every time I get a greatly elevated HR and similar sensations that i do from caffeine; which again is strange given my historical record with it. I don't use it regularly; but this development is still strange. My cardiologist doesn't really know what to tell me; other than everything is fine. All these things; in my mind; do not tell me that I am fine. I also have chronic chest pains that are centralized at the mid-base of my left rib cage and seem to be movement related; but have persisted off and on in the same location for about a year now. Any suggestions?,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Does anyone knows what causes LVH? I was told that I had HBP in 1998 and it's been uncontrollable ever since the doctor switched me from Inderal to Atenolol. He told me that Inderal was for geriatrics; but it was the only medicine that kept my BP under total control. Is LVH congential? One of my brothers had a valve replacement last year; we've always knew that he had this problem ever since he was little. The doctors always would tell our parents that my brother had a whole in his valve which caused the blood to squirt out into the chest cavity and that his valve will eventually fail when he gets older. The reason why I ask is LVH congenitial is becaue I was just diagnosed with it after I had an echo done. Then I had an pulmonary test done to check for COPD and/or asthma and was told I had neither one; but diagnosed me with CHF. Does anyone know how serious LVH and CHF is and are the reversible?

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. Yesterday I went to the new PCP I've been seeing; and he did another EKG. This time he said it showed a non specific abnormality. He diagnosed sinus tachycardia as my HR can get high. He is a very "scattered brain" doctor though. He can't seem to remember anything I tell him; and I think he's a flat out "quack!" Has any other women had similar heart symptoms after childbirth - high BP with racing heart? Can EKG's very so much between only a few months? What are non specific abnormalities on EKG's? I'm an LPN; but the heart isn't my specialty; and it's been a while since nursing school. Thanks!,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had this test because sometimes when I walk fast I get shortness of breath and squeezing in my chest and back Myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging revealed a partially reversible anterior defect; quantitaively equivocal..Left ventricular global function at post stress was normal with an ejection fraction of 60%.Gated wall motion analysis revealed normall wall motion and normal thickeniing of all myocardial segments. Left ventricular transient cavity dilatation was not observed. There was no abnormal lun uptake of radioisotoe. The quality of the study was suboptimal due to severe atenutation from a BMI of 51. Anterior ischemia can not be excluded. In view of the risk factor profile; family history of cvd; marked obesity; dysipedemia; hypertension; sedentary lifestyle; poor functional capacity and equivocal SPECT perfusion studym PET scan is advised. Maximal stress test to a heart rate of 134 bpm or 85% of predicted maximum for age 64 Typical anginal symptoms did not occur. The ekg response was negagtive for inducible ischemial. The blood pressure response to exercise was appropiate with a hypertensive baseline. The patient's functional capacity was markedly decreased. My doctor wants me to use nitro patch and mentioned maybe a Pet scan he said would take time . I am not comfortable to use nitro because I live alone and my bp may drop low and it could make me dizzy. I am seeing my doctor tomorrow; I am takin atenolol maxzide kdur and multivitamin lipitor and baby aspirin. Baseline ekg before test was normal sinus rhythm heart rate 81 and bp 144/70. I am concerned the doctor said it was slighty abnormal and not definitive. He said I could have a blockage of 70%. Can you clarify this test and his answer. Thank you,2014,2014,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I got a headache in the evening after having a steroid injection in the morning. This also happened to me when I got a steroid injection a little over a year ago.

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to "white coat syndrome"; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour. My cholesterol was 225; trigylycerides in normal range; with LDL of 159 & HDL of 49. I do not have a family history of any heart disease. I do not smoke & never have. I have one glass of red wine a day. Because my husband developed high BP & then A-fib; we have been eating a low fat; high fiber diet for over a year. I had rheumatic fever as a child; but doctors have not heard a heart murmur for years. Up until now I have been very healthy all of my adult life. I have a B.S. in medical technology. As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP. We have good insurance so can having any testing that is required; but I would prefer not to get into anything invasive until we have exhausted the non-invasive options.,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old with an AAIR pacemaker implanted for three sinus node ablations for IST that left me with a junctional rhythm.Pacemaker has been functioning very well and have been feeling great since it was implanted in Nov. 2004.Over the passt 3-4 weeks I have had a lot of fatigue; weakness and a lot of lightheadedness.I occasionally feel short of breath at times.My cardiologist checked the pacemaker and said everything was functioning fine and also check an echo(was normal) and all basic labwork(all normal).My pacemaker check did reveal that my heart rate was not getting past 90; so they made some adjustments to the rate respone feature.I am very; very active and run and do cardiovascular exercise 3-5 times/week for an hour.I am just very; very exhausted now and feel so much different than I did.BP's have been normal.I feel absolutley wiped out after my workouts now; instead of good after them like I used to.I am going to a pulmonary dr. to rule anything with my lungs out.Cardiologist thought maybe my BP was low. Checked it at home and readings were lying-109/69; hr-79; sitting 117/75; hr-75; standing 134/78; hr-74.Shouldn't my HR go up as I stand up?Do you think this is pacemaker related? Should I have them try to reprogram my pacemaker on a treadmill or check it further? Does this sound like a pacemaker syndrome; or would that show up on an EKG?Cardiologist had me increase my salt intake with thought that BP was low; but it appears normal?Should I just ignore my symptoms and move on?I feel bad to keep pestering my dr.No other medical problems in my history.Thanks,2004,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi again! I have written several times here and I want to make sure that all of the doctors on this forum are greatly appreciated! I was just wondering how long a beta blocker like Atenelol stays in the blood stream! I am going off of it because it has been making my asthma worse! However; I have been experiencing tachycardia as I go off the Atenelol! How long does the transition usually last and can it be dangerous? i only take 12 1/2 mg in the am and again in the pm. I think this is a low dose anyway! Also does this low dose usually cause asthma problems? I almost hate going off the Atenelol because it has helped my tachycardia (caused from anxiety) a lot! I also have a prescription for KLonopin. Could this hel pwith the tachycardia in place of the Atenelol? Is Klonopin and Atenelol safe to use together since they both lower heart rate? My doctor assured me it was safe! Thanks again! You all have been a lot of help to me and my hypochondria!!! :) Jamie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jamie: The dose of atenolol you are on is low. Nevertheless; I would favor tapering the dose over a few days; such as by stopping the evening dose for a few days; and then stopping altogether. However; you should discuss the specifics of stopping the medicine with your own doctor; and do what he tells you to. Even this low dose can cause asthma to worsen. Stopping atenolol abruptly can cause problems; but usually in people that have angina or hypertension. It should be safe to use Klonopin and atenolol together. Klonopin is an anti-anxiety medication and is not directly a treatment for tachycardia. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Only your doctor can provide specific diagnoses and treatments. If you would like to be seen at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment at Desk F15 with a cardiologist.,1998,1998,,

Test Results: Echo - Normal L Ventricular Function; Mild Mitral Regurgitation (antibiotic Rx'd PRN for dental work); Peak RV Systolic Pressure 8.5 mmHg greater than RA Pressure. 24-hr Holter - Baseline Rhythm: NSR; HR: Ave 59; Max; 98; Min 38; Longest Pause 1.6 sec; Few PVCs; Very Few PACs; Episodic Palpation & Dyspnea w/out Arrhythmia. To date; no further A-Fib episodes. Physical activity seems uneventful. Still get infrequent "skipped beats" &/or palpitations; but seem to occur more often in the evenings or after meals; esp. large ones/dinner. In the evening is also when the next Atenolol dosage is due. Why do I seem to be prone to developing arrhythmias at my age; & now after 5 years no problems? Is it from electrophysiological changes in the heart as I age; or could there be an anomaly in the physical relationship between my esophagus/stomach and heart as both A-Fib events (& current Sxs) seem to occur while eating/after ingesting food? (I also take Rx-strength Pepcid for acid reflux). Will my susceptibility to & frequency of A-Fib/arrhythmia occurrence increase with age; as well as reliance on Beta-Blocker usage? I'm working to lose weight; as my BMI is 30.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My 12 y/o son just started suffering from exercise induced SVT 2 days in a row he went into SVT rate of 240 bpm lasting a few hours. The first day he needed 6 mg of Adenosine the second it broke on its own after lying down on the litter in the ambulance. I am a paramedic and so is his father neither one of us is very familiar with children suffering from SVT. We are going to see a pediatric cardiologist on Monday and I would like to have some ideas in my head as to actions. I have been doing a bunch of reading and it appears radiofrequency ablation is the best option however I have not seen very much on children. Do you think it is safe for children or are medications a better route? I would prefer my son not being on medication for life especially as a pre-teen.,2008,2008,34,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,34 year old mother of two with a history of minor restrictive lung disease of unknown origin; hereditary fatty liver & sinus tachycardia. Symptoms of breathlessness have increased and sudden onset of muscle weakness; muscle atrophy of both arms; and muscle spasms from head to toe as well as severe pain in arms/ shoulders. Have been evaluated by primary doctor and labs revealed low Vit B so I have recd 1 mo of shots. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated and potasium low. Shoulder pain evaluated and ruled out pinced nerve through MRI of cervical spine. MRI showed reverse lardosis (backward or no curve of neck) and 3 bulging discs which they say is not enough to cause my muscle problems. Sent by Orthopedic Specialist to Neurologist who suspected Vitamin B culprit for muscle weakness. Have an appt to see him again next week. The only other weird thing is that they are having lots of trouble taking blood and were unable to find a vein to administer CT contrast in. My veins clot up easily and despite regular fluid intake and my fingers appear very dehydrated (odd shaped and look like they have been in water- very wrinkly). This has not ever been a problem in the past nor have the muscles had such issues. Meanwhile; visited Pulmonologist to receive update on lung capacity- dropped from mid 70's to mid 60's. Completed lung function tests including CT of chest. Results pending. The only other thing I know is that today my oxygen level fell below 85 during mild exercise test. Have an appt to see heart specialist Fri and have been struggling with elevated heart rate despite being on beta blocker already. My meds include: Atenolol; HCTZ (fluid retention for years); Norvasc (for chest pain); Potasium supplements; Flexeril (muscle spasms); and PRN of Percocet (about 1 tab every other day to get a break from pain in arms. Any advice would be helpful on questions to ask doctor or tests to request. Thank you so much for any help you can offer! I want to find out the cause as quick as possible to help resolve and be able to keep my job as a Social Worker.,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26yo female around 15-20pounds overweight. I have slightly to high blood pressure (usually around 135 / 90) and my resting heart rate is usually around 85-90. When I exercise my heart rate goes waaaaaay up. Just while walking 1.5 mile (in 30min) my heart rate went all the way up to 182bpm. The average herat rate was 143bpm. When I'm doing something a little bit more extreme it can go up to 200 and the average is around 160bpm. Should I be worried about this or is it just because I'm a little out of shape? My resting heart rate has always been around 90bpm even if I've been in a realy good shape. And should I just walk for now or is it ok to do something more difficult like ice-hockey or jogging? Is it possible that I have POTs? When I sit my heart rate is 85-90 but when I stand up it goes to 120 within 2 minutes but than it goes down to around 110. Thanks! :),2010,2011,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking Metoprolol Tartrate at various strengths for many years. I contined to take it following my ablation two and a half years ago on the advice of my PCP as a measure of safety against hypertension and heart attack survivability should one ever occur. I have leveled out on 75mg per day. I see my PCP every six months and I've noticed that each time I go; my blood pressure drops lower and lower. On my last visit several days ago; my BP was measured twice to be sure and it was 102/60. My physician didn't say anything; but I was wondering the following: The half life of Metoprolol results in a residulal amount remaining when the next dose occurs. This repeats over and over for months .... years. I would think this could cause a gradual build-up of the drug to possible very high levels. We all know that Metoprolol lowers blood pressure. Could this be the reason for my low normal readings? I still workout and skate very hard and have noticed lately that my heart is slower to respond to physical demands and that I can't get my peak heart rate above 185bpm. Any ideas?,2010,2013,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,hello doctor; i am 24 years oldfor the past 5 years i consistently exercises 5-6 times a week combined with cardio and heavy lifting. i am 162 pounds 5'8 im am probably 7% body fat; i do not take steroids or take anything bad. i do not smoke or drink. I am in nursing school so balancing school; life; and work has been stressful as of late. I consulted with my doctor because i have experiencing fluctuations in my blood pressure it can get as high as 140 systolic but diastolic is within normal range (70) but when im stress free its about 116-67. It could be from stress; i told her about some issues anxiety and palpitations but my heart rate is about 50-60 most of the time. So anyway she prescribed me 1/2 mg of atenolol a day and she sent me for an echo. My blood pressure has been good since i have been on atenolol. i had the echo and here are the results which has been concerning to me. aorctic root 29; left atrium 27; LVOT 20; septum 10; posterior wall 9; LVEDD 52; LVESD 38. The study is of good technical qualtiy. The left atrium is normal in size. the left ventricle is at the upper limits of normal in size with borderline systolic function. The estimated ejection fraction is 50-55%. NO regional wall motion abnormalities were identified. The mitral valve demonstrates normal excursion. There is mild mitral valve regurge. The aorctic valve is tricuspid and is normal in appearance. There is no aortic insufficiency seen. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The right atrium appears normal is size. The tricuspid valve is normal in appearance with mild tricuspid valve regurg. The estimated PA pressure is 33 mmhg. The pulmonic valve is grossly normal in appearance with no insufficiency seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Impression: Borderline left ventricular enalrgement with low-normal systolic function Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Boderline pulmonary hypertension. Anyway she told me since i workout very much and look very muscular there could be some overexertion; i couldnt really understand why this could cause it. She wants me to have another echo in a year. She asked how i was doing on atenolol and i told her i was tolerating it well and ask me if i would like to continue to be on the drug and we both decided there is no harm into that. She told me not to worry about it but if it continues to get bigger there is a cause for concern. So i ask for a cardiologist opinion here to help me breath a little easier thank you so much..,2011,2011,24,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Dr: Thanks again for a very informative and helpful site. I am a 36yr f; w/3 children and work p/t I am also on the b/c patch to control irregular cycles. This past Fri. I took my son to his bowling league. I went into the snack shop and felt tightness in my chest. I thought it was from the smokey atmosphere. No chest pain or rapid heartrate. I felt like this for the rest of the evening. Almost like not being able to take a deep breath in; that a good "sigh" would help. I felt like my b/p was high. I took it on Sat. and it ranged during the day from 110/75 to 130/95 mostly on the high side all day. I normally have low b/p 110/70. I have allergies and MVP by echo as mild and not meeting strict criteria from MVP but I suffer from dysautonomia. I went to a walk-in clinic on Sun. My b/p was 114/95 dr. said he would not even give the b/p readidng a 2nd thought;ekg normal; chest x-ray normal and O2 normal b/c which I have taken for the past 3 months and previously took b/c on and off for years did not feel connection. Was sent home as anxiety/stress related.I had a visit with my gp/cardio on the Weds. prior and had normal ekg and b/p. Since I feel very congested in my sinus since that time; could that cause the rise? Allergies? Does is sound stress related; the "tight band around the chest" feeling and tight neck muscles. Would taking a beta blocker if the rise is caused by stress; would it lower the pressure? I have atenolol to take on an as needed basis for palpitations. I am calling my dr. this a.m. to advise him what has happened. Any opinion? Thank you!,2000,2002,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion. Thank you for your time; F.,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I ws diagnosed with high blood pressure but as far as i know i dont have it. i had it the day i went to the doctor because i was freaking out. ever since ive tested my blood pressure and its been normal. i do have a vein on my left side of the neck that bulges somewhat when i lean forward or bend down; raise my left arm and i little bit when im eating. i can see that the vein is much more superficial on that side compared to the other side. i say this because i can se where the vein is even when it is flat. also if i put my finger on it then it bulges too as if im blocking it. im pretty sure that this vein drains blood since when i cover the top nothing happens but when i cover the bottom it bulges. ive had two doctors tell me that its my carotid and that i should not worry about it. ive also heard that thin people with bigger neck muscles tend to have this sometimes and its normal. i recently lost weight and thats around when it happened. i went from 165 to about 153 or so. im in my 20s and have no other symptoms (no chest pain or shortness of breath etc..) or pains. i dont know what this could be but im kind of worried that it could be something to do with the heart. when my physician listen to my heart he said it was normal he also listened to the veins in the neck with the stethoscope. i dont know what to think. please help me out. thanks a lot;,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels "weaker" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Over the course of 24 hours I was running a fever due to an infection in my leg that I am being treated for. It peaked at 102.7 or thereabouts. My heart was beating faster than normal. I'm on atenolol which normally keeps it to between 68 and 74 bpm. In the ER my heart rate was 98 and BP peaked at 134/85. Given my known condition of having a fusifom ascending aortic aneurysm of 4.1 X 4.2; dilated aortic root; enlarged heart; mitral regurgitation and overall heart enlargement as revealed by two CT scans a year apart; and three echo studies; is there a reason for greater concern? Have high fevers been known to cause complications in someone with my conditions? ~Dave,2013,2013,47,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Glad I found this forum. I'm a 33 year old Caucasian; female. I'm 5'4; 143 lbs. I have always been kind of an anxious person... (runs in my family) After my first daughter was born in 2002; I developed high BP during the end of the pregnancy; & during labor that never really went away. I have been on BP medicine since. I've been diagnosed with primary hypertension & sinus tachycardia. I currently take Bystolic 5 mg once daily. Used to take atenolol and Toprol for BP; but they didn't work well for me. I also used to take Zoloft for anxiety; but had to stop due to weight gain. Plus; my anxiety got better and I really didn't need it anymore. I see a cardiologist every 6 months for the BP & tachycardia. I had a stressful year last year and my anxiety started to come back. Just recently I have developed panic attacks; so to speak. Whenever I get a little nervous about a situation; the nervousness can develop in to a panic attack. The last two times I've went to the doctor I started to get nervous (white coat syndrome) & my BP and heart rate skyrocketed. My BP was 153/112; pulse was 126. I talked to my cardiologist about this; but he thought I was probably find unless my BP was staying consistently elevated which it doesn't; once the panic attack is over. With the BP medicine; my BP is about 120/81; pulse 77 normally. I have had normal EKG's; echos; and a normal 24 hour heart monitor and blood work. Cardiologist has listened to heart and lungs and says normal. My anxiety seems to be doing this. I get so anxious my BP and HR go up drastically. My cardiologist wrote me 10 mg Celexa to try for the anxiety; but I'm afraid it will make me gain weight like the Zoloft. I was just wondering any others in their 20s or 30s with anxiety dealing with these kind if symptoms with their anxiety? Anyone take celexa? If so did cause weight gain? Thanks!,2007,2013,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been in the hospital 2 time with a-fib. The first time I was drinking and running around out on an island and my heart started going crazy. They were able to get it back to normal in the ICU and I was on meds for a few months. The second time (1 year and 1/2 later) I was laying in bed and my leg cramped and I had an episode. Again; they got it under control and informed me that because I have had issues in the past I was 80% more likely to have it again. My current cardiologist has me in a daily dose of Metoprorol and baby asprin. I have been on this for over 2 years now and they have not changed anything. Is there long term side effects and am I too young to be on this regiment?,2014,2014,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 27 year old female & I started having BP problems about a year ago (at least that's when I first found out). I am now on 3 medications a day (Atenolol; Methalydopa; Hydrochlorizide). I take 50mg; 250mg; 25mg of the above meds. My BP is still about where it was when I first started taking the meds. It ranges from 135-160/90-117. High BP runs in my family; but no one else has seemed to have such a problem getting it under control. I have had my kidneys tested & some blood work (Cholesterol & Trig. are a little high; but not too bad). I have had one ekg with nothing found; and I am scheduled for another. I am a little overweight (180lbs...I find it difficult to lose the weight); but don't know if there is anything else that might be causing the problem. I try to watch my sodium intake; I quite drinking Caffine; & I ocassionaly drink alcohol. I excercise regularly. My dr. acts like it is abnormal to have such a problem at my age that the meds aren't able to control. She doesn't want to get me on too much medicine b/c of my age & if I would choose to have a child. Is there anything else I should be looking into as a possible cause; or do I just chalk this up as a hereditary disease & go with it? After my last Dr. Apt; she scheduled me an apt. with a cardiologist. Just looking to see if there is you have any advice.,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Yesterday when I went to the doctor he said he could feel my hartbeat speeding up whenever I breathed in. Is this considered to be an irregular heartbeat? Is this considered a sinus arrhythmia? If so; is this something to be concerned about? I also have pac's; pvc's; and innappropriate tachycardia at times. Thank you,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39 yr old male with permenant A-fib. I was put on metatropal and dijoxin 2 1/2 years ago. Doctor changed the beta to a calcium channel blocker a year ago and my exercise tolerance improved greatly. Recently ; after completing a marathon training program; my HR was 39 bpm in his office; so I was pulled off the Dij. After a month off dij; a holter found my HR was down to 35 at night with periods of 3.7 second pauses. This led to being switched to a beta blocker that has a pacing effect built in. I now find it difficult to run over six miles; due to difficulty in getting full breaths. 1) Is it generally harder to exercise on a beta rather than a calcium channel blocker? 2)Do they make a CC blocker that has the pacing effect (drops out on the low end)? 3)At what point do the long pauses pose a problem? 4)Am I better living with the high heart rate (180 to 220 during activity) or the low; since I have never felt real detrimental effects from either?,2001,2002,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I'm new to this forum. I am in a complicated "pickle" I guess you could say. I am a 21 year old male with hypertension but for the most part it is under control via medications. I have been having shortness of breath; chest pain(less often); and chest tightness in the center of the chest. This has started about 7 months ago. Since then; about 5-6 months ago; I had an ultrasound of the heart(I don't know the exact name of it; it is better than a stress test and has a 99% accuracy rate) by a good rated cardiologist; MRI's MRA's of my body including ultrasound of the abdomen; gall bladder tests; a 48-hour Holter monitor test(normal); Seen a pulmonologist; had a spirometer (everything is normal); Saw a GI specialist had an endoscopy; and a barium swallow. Polyps were found and removed. Biopsies came back normal other than some inflammation of the stomach. Since symptoms started I have been to the ER about 6 times also; everything was normal sent home every time. But here's the catch. I still have random chest pains in the center or just to the left of my chest; and when I get emotionally into a song; video game; or say a movie; my chest tightens up in the center and it really scares me. My doctor and pretty much all of my specialists insist they think I'm fine without further investigation. Furthermore; I have shortness of breath pretty much the whole day as I have been since all of this started. And recently; hours after drinking alcohol and sleeping; I awake with palpitations which has never happened to me before. Also in the past month I have been diagnosed with bronchitis; then I had a sinus infection; and now I have a virus which is kinda peculiar I've never been this consecutively sick and I don't know if my shortness of breath is because all of this. I pretty much have no life anymore because I don't know what's wrong with me and I pretty much am in fear of dying all of the time because all of this chest discomfort. If this isn't my heart; I'm convinced it's stomach related? I'm sick of every doctor saying it's anxiety I'm not even generally an anxious person. Please any suggestions? I don't know who to turn to my doctor seems almost annoyed with me with all of these symptoms. Thanks.,2010,2010,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted by Susan on April 21; 1999 at 19:51:11 Hi; I have always suffered with social anxiety in particular situations. I am in college; and the situations which cause me to have excessive anxiety are many. Not only do I experience dread and apprehension at the thought of speaking/participating in class; but my heart also pounds uncontrollably when I am required to speak in public. I started taking Zoloft to control the anxiety (4 weeks ago); but my heart still races--up to 130bpm. My doctor gave me Atenolol(25mg) to take as needed; and I notice a wonderful decrease in the physical symptoms of my anxiety when I take it. Also; I've always been concerned with a generally high pulse rate;It is frequently at 100bpm at rest. My doctor says that it's possibly anxiety related. I've been taking the Atenolol over the last few days when I don't have a perfomance issue because it brings my pulse down into the 80's. I like it because I don't have that sense of awareness about my heart--it's not pounding while I'm just sitting and relaxing. A friend recently told me that beta-blockers can be dangerous; and that I should rethink taking them. Now I'm worried. Have I made a mistake in taking them for non-preformance related heart racing? What are the dangers of Atenolol? Are there specific concerns for taking a beta-blocker on an as-needed basis? Thank you for any information. Susan Posted by HFHS.MD.D.E. on April 27; 1999 at 09:55:19 Dear susan; The two most widely used medications for specific social phobia associated with performance situations are Atenolol and Propranolol. These medications are also indicated for hypertension;cardiac disease and certain types of arrythmias and can help with the physical symptoms (heart racing) in patients with social phobia. The potential side effects include fatigue; nightmares;and bradycardia. If you have undergone a thorough medical evaluation and were given clearance by your primary care physician; then there should be no reason for concern. You might discuss with your physician the reasons for your rapid heart rate; which can be secondary to a number of underlying diseases such as thyroid disease. Atenolol is an appropiate medication for performance anxiety and it seems that it has been of help to you. For patients with generalized social phobia; antidepressants such as Zoloft are the treatment of choice. You have only been on Zoloft for 4 weeks and it might take longer than that for you to start feeling the benefits of this medication. I hope this information was helpful to you. It is however intended for general information only and is not a substitute for a medical consultation. Key words: Socail phobia/performance anxiety/atenolol/propranolol,1998,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I had occasional tachycardia from anxiety before becoming pregnant. During the last 4 months of pregnancy my resting pulse stayed between 90-120 bpm; but I did not have hypertension until the last couple of weeks and it was only 144/85 and 135/91. In the couple of days after giving birth I got a UTI at the hospital and my blood pressure rose to 155/106. I was watched for postpartum pre-eclampsia a few days and released only to be admitted to a closer hospital that evening with a bp of 166/115. My pulse had dropped into the 70-80's after birth; but I began taking Lopressor to lower bp. My cardiologist added Norvasc after the 166/115 trip to the hospital. My bp soon came down to 90/70s. I was told to stop Norvasc and then Lopressor. I watched for a rebound but my bp and pulse were within a normal range for a few weeks without them. I continued to check my bp about every day. One day a relative said something very cruel to me at the exact moment I was taking my bp. My diastolic was 110; but systolic and pulse were normal. My diastolic wouldn't come down so I took Clonidine (as my dr had prescribed for an emergency.) I almost fainted numerous times and was very frightened for my daughter because we were then alone. I never wanted to take it again. My cardiologist told me to take Norvasc again. My bp has been under control since then; but the diastolic always rises dramatically instead of my pulse when there's a lot of stress. My resting pulse has remained lower than 80; sometimes dropping into the 50s. I gave birth 9 months ago. My bp has been dropping into the 90/70s for over a month so I was cutting down the Norvasc slowly. My daughter is recovering from RSV and bronchiolitis. I've had a cold for about a week now. A few days ago I checked my bp and pulse before sleep and they were normal. When I awoke my bp was as expected but my pulse was 104. My pulse has been consistantly elevated since then. I went to an urgent care that evening and my pulse was 111. I had a normal EKG except for tachycardia; but an xray of one of my lungs showed infection. He didn't know if it was viral or bacterial so he gave me a script for a Zpak. I'm feeling much more energy and am drinking a lot of water. My pulse is still really high; mostly when I wake. My bp is still 90/70s when waking; but rises to 104/80(ish) in the evening. My cardiologist is on a month long vacation. I don't know if I should be concerned about the sudden tachycardia or anything I mentioned before. I don't feel sick except feeling my heart beat so fast at rest. I've also lost 4 pounds in the last week. Years ago I was diagnosed with 3 leaky heart valves; but an echo months ago said there were no leaks. I've previously worn a heart monitor that recorded tachycardia and PACs or PVCs but nothing significant to the dr. I'm 33 years old.,2011,2011,,Female

No headache till after vision restored; then headache grew to disorienting proportions by night. Discontinued bcp's. Never recurred. age 35; referred by gyn to renal/hypertension dr-good workup; hbp; prescribed Procardia-I didn't like what I read about it; never started meds; never rtnd; no symptoms at the time. Renal clearance/labs wnl. Cholesterol ~220. (Hx recurrent UTI's once a year over 10yr period; culminated in passing of "grit" with ultrasound showing renal ?pyramids? and mildly fatty liver. UTI's never recurred after "grit" episode. Ouch.) age 40; heart ct for a study showed arteriosclerosis-80% of my age group better than I. age ~41; allergies started after severe exposure to kitty litter dust and a throat sinus ear infection that went untreated too long. Since then tb test +; chest xray neg; possible latex allergy; cat/dog/horse/maple tree allergy; flu shot reaction; mosquito bite reaction; peanut butter reaction; severe reaction to bactrim and balloons-both prev no problem-face like blowfish w balloons; large hives and tiny blood blisters w Bactrim. Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; "crossed the border to mild asthma" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the "stroke." I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My "chart" is 1/2" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead. I do not agree with the hormone therapy for menopausal women-but I know it offers some cardiovascular protection? Here comes the wacko question-is anyone in the medical field currently prescribing bloodletting for menopausal women? Thanks-these forums are excellent because focus is on the details; not the first impressions.,2002,2002,,

All advise watching aneurysm growth/leakiness every 6 months--only one (surgeon I trust) advised no running; keep diary of symptoms; take blood pressure--if you can't comply; schedule surgery. I scheduled surgery. 1 cardiologist says "dilation of AA is a compensatory mechanism" and that he has "seen aneurysms assoc. w/bicuspid valves remain stable for 10 or 12 years. Don't operate yet. Trust your doctors." I'd like to trust; but only sure 1 surgeon fully understands sit'n. ?s: What are criteria for operating given my stats? Do aneurysms assoc. w/BAV's have known growth rate? What size is avg. at dissection? Marfan Foundation says BAV w/ Aneurysm is related to MFS--is this widely known/accepted? Surgeon recommends bio valve w/ replacement in 10 to 15 yrs percutaneously--please weigh-in on that.

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Catherine F. Baker on September 27; 1998 at 15:38:26: I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending. Thanks,1998,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Ok here it go's. Im really worried about my husband he is 35 years old and he is on 4 different blood pressure meds. He is on Lisinopril 10mg ; Atenolol 50mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Even with all theese meds his blood pressure is still way to high! It seems every doctor visit they add more meds. Ok I guess my question is; is it nessasary to be on 4 different blood pressure meds and is it safe? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Atenolol+hypertension,Help I am having high blood pressure-192/114. Swelling purple feet which moves up legs longer I sit(happens when sitting or standing and progresses up legs). ANA Elisa screen positive. Sedimentation rate 17; rheumatoid factor of 9. Joint pain that comes and goes; is so bad some days in my knees I have trouble getting out of bed. I am overweight 197 and 5'7" tall; but not morbidly obese; I am 37 yrs. old female. recently developed chest pain; doctor beleives it is from high blood pressure meds which is 50 mg atenolol. Doctor did not even have me come in to evaluate chest pain just said he would change me to a new bp med if I wanted but the one I am on decreases likely-hood of stroke and he wanted me to stay on it. Now I have been over the last couple of years been feeling as though something just isn't right. Blood tests show some things are "abnormal" but not enough to make a diagnosis. I feel the dr. is treating symptoms and not doing anything to locate the cause. I am not sure what to do but I have this bad feeling something isn't right and I have 2 children that I need to stick around for and a husband who is very concerned.Recently developes rash on face thought was adult acne; not sure; mostly around nose and mouth area; has spread some to upper chest and one spot on my neck. Blood pressure change has went from normal to high just in last 2 moths; bout same time rash occured; joint pain getting worse over last couple yrs. On meds bp has been about 150/88.I don't know what tests dr. should run; last blood work was 6 mos. ago. Any ideas on causes or anyone similar?,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been in PAC bi and trigeminy for the past 4 weeks - it is interfering with sleep and I generally feel tired and feel them most of the time. I have and irregular heart beat for nearly 20 years but nothing to this level. I take atenolol as well. Not sure what else to do here - maybe someone can lay out a baby step approach to this - I have kind of been doing that for myself: vitamins (magnesium); beta blockers (although the Atenolol is not working at this level so I am thinking about Inderal - any others out there that have better arrthymia suppresion); anit-arrthymic agents - the hard stuff flecanide and betapace; then ablation.

Atenolol+hypertension,I am an overweight 68-year old male with a recent history of hypertension. A recent ultrasound exam found my right carotid 100% occluded and my left 50% blocked. I am currently on two blood-pressure reducing drugs; 40mg Zocor; and 81mg aspirin. My internist suggested annual retesting of left corotid. Is this frequent enough? Should I see my cardiologist and what other types of tests should I request for a valid second opinion? Is there a better drug regimen that I can follow? What other steps can I take; other than diet and exercise; to reduce trend of increasing occlusion of left carotid artery? Thank you.,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,60 yr old male recently started on Furosemide; potassium and Digoxin after having nearly eight months of atrial fibrillation accompanied by persistent coughing; weakness and panting. Should I also be on any other meds. Is it proper to attempt pharmaceutical rythm-conversion after its been so many months at 145-150 with spurts of 195 upon bending or exercise. Isn't the preferred treatment modality these days rate oriented and anti-coagulent oriented? I've been unable to get a test for H. Pylori or heavy metals; yet H. Pylori is causative for some cases of AF and my history of heavy meatal exposure is quite possibly the cause of my persistent hypertension for this past decade; but doctors would not test lead or molybdenum levels or test for pheochromocytoma as possible cause of hypertension. I have no insurance so seeing a doctor is difficult; getting an Rx is also difficult and getting any tests seems impossible.,2005,2005,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I am a 32y/o male (165#)and believe that I have some type of problem with my thyroid and am finally investigating this with an endo. All of my test results are not yet back; but what I have so far is: FT4 1.4 (.7-1.7 ref range); FT3 3.1 (2.5-3.9); TSH 1.48 (.5-5.00). The tests that we are waiting on are the antibodies; metephrines; and some other hormone tests that he wanted ran. My symptoms consist of: Anxiety for most of my life with a significant increase about 10 years ago; diagnosed hypertension at about the same time as increased anxiety; irritability; often sleep for many hours at night and am still tired the next day; apathy; easily 'stressed out'; feeling of tightness in my upper chest/lower throat; decreased motivation; constipation; difficulty concentrating with forgetfullness; decreased libido; occassional blurred vision; often difficulty hearing (tv; radio; etc must be turned up louder than most people need). SSRIs for anxiety and dep have done nothing but caused side effects. I am taking 37.5mg of Atenolol for the blood pressure and rapid heart rate. When not on this I also have substantial anxious feelings (increased heart rate; tense muscles; blurred vision; etc). I also get mild chest pains and headaches during exercise when not on the beta blocker. I take Klonipin occassionally for breakthrough anxiety. My question is this: I seem to have both hyper and hypo symptoms mixed. My mother had thyroid problems. Based on my initial tests I appear to be within 'normal'. Do my symptoms sound indicative of hyper or hypo? What about the 'normal' tests?,2005,2005,,

Atenolol+hypertension,My ep said if he did an ablation it would be a pulmonary vein isolation and I read that this is the one where they go thru the wall between the atria to get to the left side of the heart.

Is is longer; more risky; odds for success more or less; etc. If you've undergone this procedure; or know about it; I would be grateful for any info you can pass on to me.

Atenolol+hypertension,Currently I am sitting at my desk and my heart rate is 105. I know its not too high but I am tired of it. When I wake up my heart rate is in the seventies.

Atenolol+hypertension,I know that this is a question that has been asked a lot but it still is confusing to me. Do pvc's after exercise mean an increase risk of cardiac problems. I have had a full work up. Holter; electrocardiogram; blood tests and a stress test and everything came out normal except for the pvc's. I had pvc's after the stress test but my doctor didn't seem at all concerned. I also had pvc's on the holtar while at rest. When do pvc's after exercise become a problem? Also; could adrenaline in your system; added to adrenaline caused by exercise result in pvc's after exercise? I am a 22 year old female who is in reasonably good health.

Atenolol+hypertension,My cardiologist has put me on a betablocker because I have 18% of PVC's and sometimes SVT (not so much); He says there's a small risk of developing cardiomyopathy if they don't become less. My 24h holter monitor showed that most of the PVC's were during the day. When I'm sleeping I don't have as many. So this is probably why he thinks that my heart will respond well to beta-blockers (i'm a rather anxious person) How soon should my heart starting giving less PVC's; after starting daily beta blocker therapy ?,2014,2015,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old woman who several months ago had a modified ablation of my sinus node; which subsequently caused me to have sinus pauses of up to 7 seconds and a very slow rate. The diagnosis was sick sinus syndrome and the result a pacemaker. Now I have developed new arrythmias. When I saw my electrophysiologist recently he said I was having episodes of a-fib; as well as wide complex tachycardias. These rhythms are very frequent; almost anytime I stand to do anything. I also have two small children. My Dr.told me I would end up in a-fib all of the time. He said my choices were to have my a-v node ablated and be 100% dependant on the pacemaker; or be on various heart medications including antiarrythmics; which may not solve the prolem. I also have a P.F.O. and I'm on coumadin. He said no matter what I would have to remain on coumadin. Is this because the rhythm would still exist even with the a-v node ablation; and if this is true would it eventually weaken my heart even though I'm not feeling it. My Drs. are wonderful; and I wouldn't trade them for anything. If you have and opinions or insight I would be so grateful. This forum is wonderful. You have helped so many. Thankyou for your time.

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 44 year old male; non-smoker; currently on the following meds: Toprol XL 25 mgs and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgs for anxiety-produced hypertension; along with Klonopin 0.25 mgs and Zoloft 25 mgs for Anxiety and Panic Disorder. I have been on these meds for 1 year with good results. I have always had good lipid readings; however; since beginning these meds; it appears that my lipids have risen. My recent test are: TC-220 HDL-56 LDL(calculated)-113 TRIG-253 CHOL/HDL ratio-3.9 My questions are: (1) Am I a candidate for Statin therapy? (2) Can the LDL be accurate; being that it was calculated with a TG level of 253? (3) Can the current meds I am on raise lipids?

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type "A" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise. Would this be enough or is medicine the only way to go? thanks for all your time and help,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Since Jan 06 have had chest pain; sqeezing & burning; occassional sob only during exercise. I have exercised 4-5 days wk for 2 years+. In Jan had thallium stress test; ecg; echo; ekg; holtor; ekg and ct scan to rule out stomach. Stress test stopped after 9 min. due to reaching max heart rate of 151. Bp was normal. Holtor showed heart rate at 195; 20 minutes into workout-with pain episode. Tried numerous meds to control hrt rate-atenolol; verapamil and now on toprol xl 50mg daily + baby asprin. My bp now fluctuates between normal 106/66-150/86 at rest. Don't know what it is during exercise. Cardio dx me with "Stress Induced Hypertension & Tachycardia". Says he normally sees this in a few women in teens & 20's. I'm 38. Goes away in about 5 yrs. Last wk during my spin class had no pain; but felt odd. 20 min. into class; instructor checked my pulse-10 beats normal; speed up; and stop-repeating for 2 min. Rate only 83 in very intense class. Normally about 130 now with the toprol. Has happened twice now. Still have some pain episodes. Will wear holtor again Monday. I know the hm shows the heart rates but would another stress test done at least 20 minutes be appropriate to ask for? I may or may not have an episode; but if so; would it be more likely to show what is causing the pain if it is the heart? The toprol is lowering my heart rate; but I still have pain and now these bottoming out sensations; do you have any ideas on what else could be happening? No other times; just during workouts.

Atenolol+hypertension,What is the best Channel Blocker to take if you have COPD. I was on prinivil 20 mg (alpha) and new Doctor had fit and put me on Verapasimil 80 mg 3x per day. Just went on so can't tell real effects on brething but having to take 3 times day is sorta of a pain. Also I don't want to go another 3 years on the wong meds. This is off Wlamart's list $4-10.00 cost. No insurance so have to watch budget/. Also what do you think of Cymbalta? I love it. feel normal for first time years. Have been taking a week.

Atenolol+hypertension,I'm now 38 weeks pregnant; been given the ok to have a vaginal delivery as they STILL after over 3 yrs cannot find the cause of my sinus tachy. It is pretty much like IST but it presented with high bp with normal thyroids etc. So I was put on beta blockers (Atenolol) which worked perfectly for both bp and heart rate in the first year; then in the summer of the second year my heart elevated again but my blood pressure remained normalized. (1st yr Heart rate on beta blockers was about 60 max except with bouts of SVT during anxiety attacks; 2nd yr it went up to between 70 and 80 at rest and has pretty much been like that since; but goes between 90 and 100 after meals). I'm now due to give birth very very soon and I'm terrified! I don't know how much the heart rate goes up by when you give birth but I hope to have an epidural so I don't feel the pain much; I've also heard that it lowers blood pressure so maybe it might help. When I gave birth to my first child I was fine and my heart rate was normal; it was 4 months after delivering him that I developed the sinus tachy with hypertension. Can anyone reassure me with the birth side of it though? Im really worried about the pain and the exertion of the labour. Also; my circulation is pretty poor (it was thought that it might have been the cause of the sinus tachy and hypertension as I developed really bad circulation over a few weeks just before they discovered the heart rate and blood pressure probs). I'm so scared as my local health care professionals don't seem to care; I'm in a small town in the UK and they just keep saying it's "anxiety" and that's the only answer I get! I've been quite ill and exhausted with this pregnancy which I wasn't with my first; so you can imagine my fears at giving birth.,2007,2010,31,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am new to the forum and have been reading many postings. I have been having a problem for the past two months where I experience skipping heart beats. I have had problems with this a few times in the past the first time was just after the birth of my daughter and then again when I was around 35 but at that time I had just lost my father to a heart attack. I've been to the ER several times in the past few months due to my palpitations and keep being told that I am having PVC's and they are not serious and I shouldn't worry. Well; tell that to someone who suffers too with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I take clonopin for the anxiety but lately it's doesn't seem to help. I also take Atenolol; 50mg. daily for the palpitations. It seems to help for about 3 hrs. and then things start up again. I also have hypertension and take atacand; norvasc; and clonidine for it. I am at a loss as to what to do. I've had a stress/echo and a couple of echocardiograms and have been told that things look good. My refraction rate is 60% and I've been told that is wonderful. So; why do I have my heart skipping beats? It is scaring me and then that adds to my anxiety which I am sure doesn't help. These palpitations are making my life miserable and I am afraid to leave the house. My life is very stressful due to my husband who is trying to recover from a serious car accident and was told just a couple of weeks ago that his broken arm isn't healing and he will need another surgey. Also; he lost his job and was forced into early retirement which cost us all our life's savings. Now we live on 60% of what my husband made when he worked. We were not prepared for this as we had 4 more years; we thought; to get our finances in order. I am a retired nurse but the places I worked never offered any kind of retirement plan so what we had in savings was what I was able to put into it from my pay checks. I am sure that the stress I am under isn't helping my heart and with heart disease in my family and having hypertension; I am scared that I am just a heart beat away from a heart attack or stroke; no pun intended. I need HELP! Thank you to anyone who answers.,2009,2009,56,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Want to tap into the collective experience of those who are on; or who have been on blood pressure medications. What have you tried? What dose? What was your blood pressure before and after? What side effects from the meds? How long did you stay on them? Etc; Etc. Anything anyone wants to add on this topic is appreciated; even a joke by RGlass which is always a treat :) -- Jim,2005,2009,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth on January 18; 1998 at 00:41:55: I am a 47 year old female with chronic hypertension; right-sided CHF; and angina. Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?). I suffer excruciating headaches from them and have been told I have to live with them until we can find the cause of the angina. Is that true or do I have other options there as well?,1998,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was just diagnosed with non valvular atrial fibrillation two weeks ago and sent home on amiodarone 200mg/day after I had a chemical conversion with amiodarone. This stuff makes me unable to do anything. I am also taking xarelto 20mg a day. Before this event I was having issues with palpitations and was diagnosed with hypertension in Feb 2012 and have been having trouble with getting the right medication. I am on Norvasc 5mg and 12.5mg hctz both one a day for the hypertension. My issue is that when I do normal activity like picking up around the house I am winded and cannot work very long. I also still have an issue with feeling like I am going to pass out (had these episodes for 6 months before they diagnosed the htn). I am on short term disability but am concerned because I have to drive to work an hour each way. I feel like my doctors are not addressing my issues and I am wondering if there are any suggestions. I am only 48 years young; my only other issue is my obesity and I am working on losing it. This whole thing has made me anxious and I am contemplating seeing a therapist.,2012,2012,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hey all sorry haven't been on in awhile I've been trying to keep myself busy. As u all know my bf relapsed with hep c virus a few months back. We went last week and had an EGD done; they put on 7 bands during the procedure. It was pretty bad; close to bursting but were extremely fortunate that they were able to catch it in time before they started to bleed. He will go back I'm the next few months to have the same procedure done again several times. We went to his regular dr appt yesterday to talk about our options in treating hep c again. Dr wants to hold off before starting treatment again until we get the EDG procedures taken care off; also he wants to wait and see what new treatments will be available.,2012,2013,22,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doc; as always thanks for allowing me to ask a question. As a 29 year old symptomatic (chest pain; dizziness; nausea) sufferer of frequent PVC's (10-30\min) with mild hypertension for the most part controlled by 12.5 mg Atenolol daily; but with an apprantly stucuturaly normal heart could you offer an insight into the following; 1) My understanding is in general PVC's that are supressed on exercise do not pose a problem; but PVC's NOT supressed on exercise can? A recent stress test I had; when compared to one taken some 18 months earlier showed that whilst my BPM were taken up to about 170 the PVC's were no longer completely supressed; at one point I was getting 15\min with the only notable symptom being dizziness. Though in the computers words no complex ectopy (At rest I can enter long bouts of bigeminy) 2) A lot of respected websites state that in general 6 or more PVC's\min do require treatment; if so; what is the prognosis for one getting the rate of them that I do (as high as 30\min at worst; average 15\min) Can the irritable focus develop over time ie. like water running over stone over the years if you see what I mean. So that sooner or later; a pathway may be completed which could change the situation. 3) In my case; after recording triggers for my PVC's I have noted the following inflame them; Eating food; any food; and taking fluids (hot; cold or normal) Sudden bouts of activity ie. becoming mobile from being at rest. Coughing Sneezing Or no reason in particular; away they go Eating food is particularly agitating; because I eat le,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm on a small dose of bisoprolol; 2.5 mg's. To be honest it doesn't help the pvc's. Is there a specific beta blocker that deals directly with supressing these pvc's. I've been on toprol as well with no positive results.,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this "defect" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were "shuddering"); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a "click"? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid "leaking" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in "slower motion". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest "rushes" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these "weird" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol. Thank you for your time.,1995,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,my mother is a healthy active 64 year old who has a sed rate of 97 and c reactive protein was 14 in october and 21 in november. this was tested in october and reconfirmed in November. currently she has no symptoms but the Dr.'s say they need to know what is causing this. She underwent a CT scan from the neck down a few weeks ago which came back clean. Dr.'s do not have a diagnosis. what could this be from..are there anyother tests she should undergo and is this something she should be very concerned about..,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. Over the course of a year; I begin have strange tingling sensations in my left arm. Eventually they traveled to my hand; and I would feel pricks in my fingers or see the fleshy part twitch. Later same symptoms traveled to left foot;followed by ankle and heel pain. I have had left sided headaches; primarily in the temple area. The headaches were constant; throbbing; or would feel like a crawling sensation. My current headache has lasted about five weeks. Occassionally; there is twitching around the eyes; and a tingling sensation in the face; particularly near the lips. Also ear pain;tenderness behind ear and jaw. Add to these symptoms general twitches throughout the body; a very stiff feeling left hand and sore left arm;leg pain; achy knees; back pain -upper and lower; shoulder and neck pain; often both sides-more pronounced on the left. I have had a nerve conduction test on the left arm; an MRI of the cervical spine; and a brain MRI; plus consults with a orthopedic Dr (physiatrist?); and a neurologist. All negative results. The neuro Dr. said he saw what might be a small bone spur on the MRI. Some blood work five months ago - CBC normal; thyroid normal but have a history of Graves disease - untreated now but thyroid is still irregularly shaped. Also have hypertension - 25 mg Atenolol. Physiatrist doesn't know what to do with me - do I just let my body heal naturally with rest (he suggested stress) or do I pursue something further? Please advise. Sorry for length -wanted to be clear,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm female; 45 yrs. old with hypertension (treated with 100mg atenolol daily); hashimoto's (synthroid 200mcg); and rheumatoid arthritis. After a sudden loss of sensation in my left armpit which extended to about my elbow; some pretty severe chest pains and a bad headache; I was hospitalized for a few days to run several tests including; brain MRI;ultrasound of neck and chest;stress test; nuclear scan on my chest as well as lots of bloodwork. The conclusion....absolutely nothing. I was given 2 doses of morphine to relieve the chest pain after nitro failed to help and after that the pain subsided.However;4 days later my armpit is still numb.Very numb.In the last 3 months I've noticed some changes in vision(blurred);occasional slurred speech and a clogged feeling in my head and ears. It's actually difficult to hear.And 1 other thing; once in a while my nose will drip what looks like water; I'm not at all congested or coughing nor have I had a cold. I'm most concerned with the numbness.The neurologist on call casually mentioned that I might follow up with him later but he didn't seem concerned.Any thoughts?,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control. Thanks - Cody,1999,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doc; I have a question about pvc`s. My question is if pvc`s subside;do you still have them occuring.Mine are starting to subside and I was wondering if you still have them even if you don`t feel them. Would they show up on a holter moniter if you didnot feel them occuring? These are new to me; I`ve only had them for a month. They started when I started taking Propranolol 20mg/day for cardilogist suggested high bp[140/90;135/85]. I started to get side effects to the drug so he lowered it. I went to a bp clinic and suggested that I should`nt be on it.[ Suggest lowering salt and weight first to see if that help. Also lower anxiety that I was experiecing from the side effects. I toke the lowered dosage for 13 days when all of a sudden I stared to experiece pvc`s. I went to the cardio and he raised me back up to 20mg/day and after 2 wk they are subsiding to the point that I can barely feel them. I am wondering that if I stop feeling them ; are they still occuring. Can they reoccur? If the bp clinic wants me to stop taking the meds for bp; will the pvc`s reoccur? How much control does 20mg/day have anyway. I am at a total loss as to what to do! I see the blood pressure clinic on Jan. 5 to see what my pressure will be. If they are gone by then do I stop taking the meds for blood pressure or do I continue to take meds for control? of pvc`s if they are gone. Any help in this matter would greatly be apppreciated. Thanks Lou F.,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. My questions are . My average heartrate during the morning and afternoon are between 85 to 105 bpm. It usually rises right after eating. From around 5 pm My average heartrate is around 80 bpm and at night it averages between 54 and 62 bpm. I take Cozaar 50mg daily for borderline hypertension; which I would say contolls my B/P quite well . Again my B/P during the day averages between 125/85 to 120/80; but at night my B/P averages around 110/70. I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis; which is usually worse in the morning; Do you think this disease might actually contribute to the these fluctuations in heartrate and B/P. I had an Echo done two and a half years; which showed marginal concentric LVH; which the doctor said was probably due to mild hypertenion; measurements on diastole measured between 10mm to 12mm; I understand the normal range is 8mm to 11mm; Would you suggest another echo at this time or do you think it can wait a bit longer> I had an ECG in Feb this year which was normal. I do suffer from PVCs ; but since I stopped taking atenolol; the PVC are few and far between thank goodness. It slowed my heartrate but aggravated the PVCs. Do you think that beta blockers can aggravate PVCs in some persons; while helping others? And last but not least; Are you aware of data or studies that show or suggest that people who usually complain of PVC ; Pacs and palpitaions are usually shown to actually have stronger and healthier hearts than average? Thanks in Advance; hank.,2001,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Howdy. Glad I found this site. Description: 41 yr old male. Non-smoker; controlled hypertension; about 40 lbs overweight; large frame man; 6'3" 275 lbs. I started having a-fib 4 yrs ago; age 37. Did all the test and heart seems normal except a slightly enlarged atrium; maybe due to undiagnosed HBP on my part. Went thru all the meds with no help. Had my first ablation in Austin in Jan. 2002. Went back into a-fib within 2 weeks. Doctor said give it 3 months. Same pattern developed where it would stay in for a week or two and then return to sinus for a week or two. Finally in May of 2003 I went into a-fib 24/7 and been in since. The EP says another ablation has about a 50/50 chance of working. Questions. 1). Should I try another ablation first? 2). With the failed ablation and the enlarged atrium should I just go ahead and put in the pacemaker. The EP says it has the best chance of controlling my life. 3). Does everybody experience consant dizziness and lightheadedness? Is this a symptom of the A-fib or the meds. I am currently on Diltiazm. Lisinopril; Atenolol. Thanks in advance for your help and it's good to see a sight where you can talk to other people and MDs at the same time. Greg P.,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 34 yowf with obesity. 2 years ago suffered a "panic attack" but I asked my PCP to exhaust every avenue of my heart because I got very scared. EKG's have all been normal. Bloodwork taken at the ER various times- Normal. Heart monitor showed I had some PVC(?) but those are normal/benign he said. Echocardiogram-I have ?? about- The conclusion is: Normal left venricular function with minor mitral andd tricuspid regurgitation. No other structural heart disease identified. Estimated right heart pressures are borderline elevated. Measurements show IVS 0.7 (nl 3.5-5.6cm); LVD 4.9 (nl 2.5-5.4cm); LVS 1.9 (nl .6-1.1cm); LVPW .6 (nl .6-1.1cm); Fractional Shortening 60.9 (nl 21-57%); LA 3.9 (nl 1.6-4.0cm) then out from that is 2D 4.5 x 3.1.; AO 3.0 (nl 2.0-3.7cm); AVE 1.9 (nl 1.5cm) RV 2.5. Under interpreation everything said normal other than what mentioned in Conclusion except "mild age changes to aortic and mitral valve"; okay now my ?? are: What do the measurements mean; especially the ones that seem out of normal range? Would being extremely nervous/scared during ECHO effect results? What are PVC's; why do I feel them? Sometimes if I feel my pulse in my neck it's as if I feel a slight "delay" is that nl? I am currently on Atkins losing weight; walking; yesterday BP was 116/75 with meds (toprol XL 50 qd; Micardis HCTZ 80/12.5 qd). Does this sound like a normal heart to you? It doesn't take much to get it going with exercise but I am (WAS) over 150 lbs overweight; now only 125 so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it. I try and keep pulse in 140's when exercising,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am on Toprol XL 25 mg and a diuretic 25 mgs. The information insert on the Toprol XL says to inform the dentist I am on this medicine before any procedure. I did tell my dentist; and asked him why; and he said it is because of the chance of the epinepherine causing palps. I also asked my cardiologist if it is OK for me to receive the epi in the dental office; and he told me that the amount of epi is so small; it should not cause any problems and is OK to use. Has anyone had any adverse problems with this when they were at the dentist?; and for the MedHelp Doctor: ""Have you seen any real problems with this?" I would hate to create a rapid or irregular heartbeat to myself; let alone a bad rise in BP....I take meds for panic disorder the way it is.....last thing I need is more adrenaline being shot in my body!!!

Atenolol+hypertension,I'am a 46 yo male who has had pvcs since age 29. family history of heart disease on maternal side. I'am in good condition and active.I've had elevated BP for years .Have been on atenlol 25mg twice daily for 15 years which manages bp well avg reading 118/65. The atenonlol controlled pvcs for years but when I hit around 40 they came on with a vengence .I've had the usual battery of holters; event monitors; regular and nuclear stress tests and echo's all OK. After reaching the point of intolerance3 years ago I decided to try flecainide 50mg twice daily which stopped the Pvcs cold. At same time I reduced atenolol to 25mg and added a low dose of ACE inhibitor to control BP. Then at my physical last year Blood tests showed low white cell count . Cardio took me off the flecainide and Ace and put my Atenlol back to 50 mg. After three months white cell count back to normal but those cursed pvcs have come back to pre flecainide levels of probably several thousand per day. Cardio mentioned sotolol but I am haesitant and have been living with them and have not tryed the sotolol. I am concerned that these meds are worse than the disease but if I must go back on one is flecanide or sotolol better or is it a toss up? I feel as did my cardio that the ACe was the cause of the white cell depression.Should I get any other tests given my history?The low heart rate from the beta blocker seems to spur the pvcs is it feasible I wean off the beta and try another med for BP control? Are these runs of pvc's a reason alone to treat them or should I live with it? your opinion of my situation? than,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Because my dad lives in a foreign country; communication is a big problem when he visits the doctor. He had a triple bypass 6 years ago. General feeling of unwell for last 2 years. Lately; bouts of light-headedness. 2 weeks ago; vision affected for an hour - could not see to the left out of both eyes. 1 week ago; happened again for half an hour. Saw neurologist - had brain scan which was clear. (Q1)Is this likely to be a problem with his bypass surgery or a seperate problem in the arteries leading to the brain?

Atenolol+hypertension,Concerning Treadmill exercise stress testing: 1) Is it a fairly safe test for a person with no known heart disease; but with risk factors such as hypertension; anxiety; and panic disorder; like myself? 2) If a cardiac event were to occur; would it occur at peak exercise; or would it happen during the recovery phase? 3) My last test was in 2001; at age 41....test was negative; and I worked up to 10.1 METS on the Bruce protocol.....I understand that stress tests can determine blockages of 70 % and higher; but I was told by the tech. that I worked hard enough to determine that there was not even a 50 % blockage.....Does that sound correct? 4) I am on Toprol XL 25 mgs a day.....will I be instructed to stop it before testing? Thanks-Jerry,2003,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all; I have a question I hope someone qualified can help with. 31 years ago (at age 6); I started taking Inderal prescribed while suffering from congestive heart failure related to kidney damage (caused by a birth defect that was previously fixed; but obviously the damage remained). The inderal was prescribed as a result of high blood pressure. 17 years ago; I had a kidney transplant. There was no evidence of high blood pressure post transplant. But since I appeared to tolerate the inderal; the doctors decided there was no reason to discontinue it. 7 years ago; after complaining of fatigue and dizziness; a new doctor (I'm in an HMO...I rarely see anyone twice) said we should discontinue the Inderal (then 60mg 2x/day). He said there would be no problem going Cold Turkey. 7 days later; I ended up on the side of the road shaking violently; heart beating "out of my chest"; fainting and generally thinking I was having a stroke or heart attack. I had never experienced anything so frightening. A trip to the emergency room resulted in the ER doc saying; "oh; you had a panic attack. Go home; you're fine." My transplant docs suggested I go back on Inderal; saying it could help the anxiety (no suggestion of weaning; or that going cold turkey might have CAUSED the anxiety etc.). I promptly complied. After reading too much about anxiety off the Internet (believing I had a panic disorder since thats what the ER doc suggested); I then started giving myself panic attacks over dumb stuff. Although the Inderal "took the edge off"; it was a few years before I finally realized my only real issue was minor sinusitis that can cause headaches/dizziness when driving up mountains or when low pressure systems. I still get minor panicky feelings at times (mostly get clausterphobic a little); but have learned how to ignore then. NOW; I'm trying to get preggers; and the perinatologist wants me off the Inderal for a few reasons. One; she wants to know if I even have hypertension anymore (since we've seen no sign of it since the transplant). Two; at her office today my heart rate was 42 BPM. She had me do some jumping jacks; and then dryly said "gee; that got you to 45 bpm; nice try." She thinks it might be the Inderal (go figure; after 31 years!). BTW; these days I'm on 40mg once per day (I exercise in the afternoons; so I skip the morning dose with doc approval in the hope of getting at least a little cardio benefit). My heart rate is usually very low; in the 50s or 60s. After skipping a dose I can get it to 120 running on a treadmill. I occasionally have palpitations; and I believe irregular/skipped heartbeats that have never been caught on an EKG; but generally can be "cured" with a good cough. I have had a couple of episodes where for no discernable reason the treadmill will claim my heart rate is 178 when I'm not even moving. And a couple more times where I was kicking butt and the heart rate didn't get about 55. These may or may not have been malfunctions of the equipment; but generally those days I felt something was off. Doctors have refused the "holter" device because they say at my age and with my EKG (always normal); they don't see the risk (the only other risk factor I have is that I'm about 40lbs overweight). OKAY; thanks for reading thus far. Here's my question: The doc wants me to start by going down to 20mg 2x/day for a few weeks. Given all of the above; is this pretty safe? What should I look out for? If the anxiety kicks back up; should I just ride it out? I tried asking the doc all this; and she said not to worry so much. Which is great advice; but contrary to my personality. PLUS; since I've been on this darn drug since I was a kid; I don't even know what "normal" is. But I want it. It's gotta be better than being a fat zombie who is always cold. :-) Advice appreciated; since there's a lot of wild info on the Net on this topic (IE "stop inderal and you'll have a heart attack!" etc. Talk about giving a gal something to worry about!),2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 36 yr old male. Work out 4 days a week. I got an MRA last week for some bad headaches I'd had over the weekend (turned out to be migraine). As an incidental finding on the MRA; my PCP called and said I had a 3 mm aneurysm on the anterior communicating artery. He was very dismissive of this and said this is a very tiny one; asymptomatic and likely has been with me most of my life. He said he wanted to recheck it periodically and that I should not worry. Easier said than done. I've been a wreck; worrying that I have a ticking bomb in my head and everytime I take a jog or play some indoor soccer I'm thinking its either going to grow or possibly rupture. I've stopped weightlifting (I did moderate not very heavy weights) and I've given up my weekly cigar. I don't drink and I take atenolol for borderline hypertension. I've had nobody in my family going back several generations ever die of stroke or have an aneurys rupture. My doc senses my anxiety over this and has told me to see a neurosurgeon here in Cincinnati to have an expert evaluate it. He still absolutely thinks surgery is not adivsed at this time and that periodic observation is the wisest choice. I'm quite worried that a neuro"surgeon" is going to want to operate. My other concern is that watching and waiting may require me to stop all cardio exercise and sport which is my main stress relief and joy in life. Based on the info I've provided what is your take on this type of small aneurysm finding and your take on what should be done (watch and wait or operate?); limitations on actitivies? Thank you. -Jason,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,34 m; african amerian with a history of hypertension/hypertensive heart dx; currently taking amlodipine; captopril; atenolol and moduretic to control my bp. This is a new development; for about a week now i notice that i have difficulty breathing; or rather a sort of loss of the urge to breath or loss of respiratory drive or kind of my breathing is not automatic anymore; i have to force myself to drag in air into my lungs. It starts about 2-5 mins after during smoking or just after smoking; the first time it was so serious i had to get out of the car and stand up forcing myself to breath to stay alive; later on i noticed that the feeling seems to be relieved by alcohol; if i take some alcohol the loss of respiratory dirve seems to go away or rather if i am drinking and smoking i don't notice any loss of respiratory drive; another intriguing thing is that i don't always have this feeling when i smoke; it just comes up sometime and other times it doessn't; i can have it when i smoke now; but hours later i may try smoking and it doesn't happen; i'm surprised; anyway i've decided to quit since i can't pinpoint the exact cause or solution to the problem; will appreciate it if someone can help me though so i can go on enjoying my smokes again,2009,2010,34,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,for about a week now i've noticed that i experience an acute loss or respiratory drive when i smoke; maybe just after a few drags or a few mins after i finsh smoking; first time it was very serious i had to get out of the car and force my self to breathe; later on i realised that the symptom is relieved by alcohol. and if i smoke and drink it doesn't happen; also it doesn't happen every time i smoke; just starts out of the blue. will like to know the cause and treatment. i am 34 male hypertensive and currently taking atenolol; amlodipine; moduretic and captopril to control my hypertension; don't knwo if it is a drug interraction; i am not sure cos at times i will smoke it doesn't occur. anyway have decided to quit; this is my second day off cigs; but if i can know the cause and treatment i might go on enjoying my cigs. i used to be asthmatic but this phenomen i am not sure if it is ashmtha cos there is no wheezing; altho i have not tried my salbutamol inhaler to c how it responds; just decided that quitting might be better after all cos of my hbp too,2009,2010,34,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia. Lately; I've been experiencing severe nausea; dizziness; fatigue; weakness; and headaches whenever I exercise; which is a mixture of walking and weight training. Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10"); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem? Or am I just turning into a medical basket case?

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; all - I am currently on 2 mg. diazapam (valium) and 5 mg. celexa (half a 10 mg. pill). I just started the celexa about 3 weeks ago; and have been on an even lower dose (working up frm 1/4 to half to 3/4 to 2 mg last month - my own way - I was prescribed the 2 mg.). Prior to the valium; I was on Ativan for about 2 months. My understanding from my psychiatrist is that the 'plan' is up the celexa (although I don't know how far - I have dysthymia and ocd; so I hear...) and at some point come off the valium. I also have hypertension; so take atenolol and lisinopril and a baby asprin each day. I'm 59 years old. Anyway; I see my primary care doc once a month - he is a cool old-school guy; who used to see me primarily for 'reassurance' for various anxiety / ocd issues until he decided I needed a psychiatrist to give me meds. He sent me to a colleague; who has me on these meds. Those close to me - my husband; therapist and a friend who is a former RN and who herself takes lexapro; all say I am doing 'much better' than I was. When I started posting here; I could barely eat solid food - mashed potatoes were difficult. Now; I have made some real improvement (hamburger; cut up; soft veg; and so on); although I'm not yet where I need to be (can't eat chicken; and so on.). When I saw my primary care guy yesterday; I saw I'd gained 5 lbs. OMG! I want to blame the meds but the reality is as I can eat stuff; I grab all the things that are bad for me; like donuts; cakes; chips and mex food. In any event; 5 lbs in one month seems high. My BP was also up but the doc wasn't concerned so much. He thought I might ask the psych to 'cut back' on the valium; as I complain of being 'lazy' and 'tired.' I will have been on some sort of valium in any case since February; albeit at a low dose. He also suggested asking to cut back on the celexa - to 2 mg. Huh? My psych said I wouldn't feel anything on 5 mg. I do feel somewhat tired; but I really doubt she's going to go down to 2 mg. I think my primary care doc's focus was to get me to a point where I could eat again. The psych seems to be looking at things differently - telling me I might have to take meds for my ocd 'for the rest of my life.' I am just starting the process of trying to get ON SSRI's; not off them. Aside from some nausea and tiredness / apathy; no big deal on the side effects. But I am confused. Do I try to get OFF this stuff now? If I do; will I still be able to eat? Will folks think I'm 'better?' I'm inclined to think my success is from the meds; and that if I go off; it won't be long before I'm back to square 1. I don't want to be; but why would my primary care suggest I cut back on such low doses? I serously doubt my psych would consider lowering anything at this point; I"m almost afraid to ask. I hate to bring up that my primary care doc suggested it; as they are colleagues at the same clinic - and well; in a showdown; you know who gets thrown under the bus - and it aint either of them. One or the other will say I didn't understand or whatall; just to save face... at least that's how that stuff usuall works. Ok; any one have any ideas on what i can do here? How can I discuss this w/ my psych diplomatically? She's a bit of a diva; but she seems to be very smart and I like her. I like my primary care doc too; though; and that's the problem. They both seem to have divergent opinions. As I see my psych next week; I need input asap - thanks. Anna,2008,2011,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I AM HYPERTENSIVE FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. I AM ON MEDICATION SINCE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. I WAS TAKING NILOL (ATENOLOL 50 + NIFEDIPINE 20) ONE PERDAY. I DID NOT FEEL ANY PROBLEM. ABOUT SIX MONTHS BACK I CHECKED MY CHOLESTROL. IT WAS 224. DOCTOR GAVE ME 1. REVELOL (METOPRALOL 25 + AMLODIPINE 2.5) BD; TELMISARTAN 40 OD; RESUVASTATIN 40 OD AND ECOSPRIN 75 OD. AFTER THREE MONTHS MY TOTAL CHOLESTROL CAME DOWN TO 85. DOCTOR DISCONTINUED RESOVASTATIN. AGAIN AFTER THREE MONTHS I CHECKED MY TOTAL CHOLESTROL WHICH WAS 220. I WAS FEELING PALPITATION AND SLEEPLESSNESS AT NIGHT; DOCTOR CHECHED MY THYROID WHICH CAME OUT TO BE 20.9 RECENTLY DAIGNOSED. I AM TAKING THYREODINUM 3X ? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF CURE ? HOW LONG SHOULD I TAKE ? I SHALL CHECKUP MY THYROID AFTER ONE MINTH. I DO NOT WANT TO START ANY DRUG FOR THROID. CAN YOU SUGGEST ME IF I AM DOING WRITE ?,2011,2011,62,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Has anyone who suffers from Hypothyroidism have any problems with their blood pressure being too low? I have read a lot of sites that have covered hypothyroidism and HIGH blood pressure. But I do not now nor have I ever had High Blood pressure. On an average I run around 90/70 but there are times when I can feel my blood pressure dropping and when I do it is always with the following symptoms: I just want to sleep; no matter how much work there is still to be done; and I get a little foggy in my brain. Over time I learned to test my blood pressure when I started to feel that way. Two weeks ago I was feeling that way and tested it at the local grocery store and I was 97/58 with a normal pulse rate. I have asked Dr's repeatedly how low is to low and get told nothing usually. Out of sheer desperation I asked the local pharmacist for suggestions on what to do when I felt that way. The answer was shockingly simple and yet has at least partially helped me out. That answer was get some Gatorade and drink it. She said it was the salt and electrolytes that I was needing. It's not a cure but it does seem to help me in any case. I just want to know am I the only one out there that has LOW Blood pressure with this? thanks!,2011,2011,33,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am having palpitations occasionally that feel so very forceful. They cause me to stop what I am doing immediately and I obsess about them for hours afterword. I have a history of anxiety and panic and depression. I am currently taking lamictal and lexapro with atenolol for high blood pressure and anxiety reduction. I have been diagnosed with hypertension and anxiety and depression. I had a full cardiac work up with chemical stress test; echocardiogram; bloodwork; nuclear medicine heart exam; and my cardiologist said I was fine. This work up was around 2 years ago. The only thing is that my C-reactive protein is elevated. I believe it is in the 8 range when anything >3 is considered high. I do not remember the unit of measurement with that. My cholesterol is slightly elevated from what I hear but it is still within normal limits and as such no medication has been prescribed. I have GERD and I am taking prilosec but this was diagnosed only recently and the palpitations existed prior to that problem. I am a 28 year old morbidly obese male. I am in the process of continuing to lose weight as I am 5'11 and 345 pounds. Even though they say I am ok whenever I have those terrible palpitations I am just so fearful that the end is near. What can I do? Did they miss something; or am I just obsessing? How do I know the difference? Is it time for another workup? Help! -Jorsen,2011,2011,28,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently started taking Toprol xl 25 mg because my resting heart rate will sometimes be a little above 100. The cardiologist i went to told me to take it only when i have an episode of a fast heart rate which only happens like every other day or so. After reading information on the drug through i feel like all the websites say to take it every day. Is it still safe to take it every few days or so?,2011,2011,22,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,For those of you who have been experiencing and/or suffering with these pin-pricking and burning sensations over the years like me; I was just diagnosed with lupus in December 2010! It was learned via my remarkable dermatologist who noticed that I was getting a butterfly rash on my face that prompted him to test me for this disease. This type of rash is commonly found on people with lupus. Please ask your physician's to check your ANA levels; to confirm if your pin-pricking and burning sensations are in relation to lupus like mines!! My symptoms had ceased almost immediately after being removed from the medication; but I had already developed this disease. PLEASE; don't delay getting this blood test done; because if you have lupus and it remains untreated-- it can affect your organs (heart; kidneys; brain) which can become severe; and even deadly!! Also; my lupus was drug-induced by a long-term seizure medication that I was prescribed for a number of years. There are tons of medications; to include hypertension meds like (Atenolol); diuretics (HTCZ); and anti-inflammatories (Naproxen) that can induce lupus as well! Check out your meds too! Good luck to each of you; because these symptoms are truly annoying; and can affect the quality of ones life tremendously!!!,2011,2011,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 yr female/ 5'3" 200 lbs/ overweight /non-smoker/ hypothyroidism/ take 90 Armour / mild hypertension/ 50 atenolol About six weeks ago; I was shoveling snow and felt a tiny 5 second stabbing pain in the upper left center of my chest. then i resumed shoveling and was fine. The next several days my shoulder and left arm were very sore and almost like an icy/ hot feeling all over that arm. I thought I had pulled my shoulder blade or something. I was seen by a chiropractor. He took my BP; it was normal. Took my pulse; it was normal. He adjusted me. That pain lessened after a couple of days. However; I continued to feel some slight chest; shoulder; back and arm pain. I experience some mild stabbing/ burning in my left arm pit and shoulder blade- almost like it wraps around my left breast and shoulder. Also; I have been experiencing more "wet" belching than normal for the last month; on and off since this occurred. I did NOT experience dizziness or lightheadedness. I have not really been short of breath; except when I start to be anxious and panic about it. Sometimes I feel fine; and other times; I feel this pain. It is aggravating. It is the worst at night. I was supposed to have a surgery; so after about a month of on and off pain; I had blood work and a pre-op EKG. It came back abnormal. It scared the dickens out of me; and i panicked in the middle of the night (the same day i recieved the results) and ended up going to the ER. The ER doc rain blook work and looked at my chest xray and did two more EKGs; with similar abnormal results-- basically all saying i had possible av block; abnormal twaves; and possible enlargment of right and left atriums. The ER doc said I had not had a heart attack and I was fine; just to follow up with a stress test to get clearance for my surgery. I was referred for a nuclear stress test. My baseline EKG at the stress test said "cannot rule out anterior infarct".... but the imaging came back normal. In fact; the stress test went well; reaching heart rate of 160 in 11 minutes. The cardiologist said the nuclear stress test came back normal with "excellent functionality and no cause for alarm". The cardiologist said that my heart was fine and everything looked good and the EKG readings often come back as "false positives" on young women so I shouldn't worry. After an exam; he said my heart "sounded" good. My blood panel was good. My chest xray was good. He said though he can't promise I will never have a heart attack that today my "ticker's just fine". No reason for the chest pain was explained or even mentioned by the cardiologist. He only said to exercise more often as a preventative because of my family history (dad had two heart attacks at 50; but he was a very heavy smoker). I have been exercising every day for the last week; running on the treadmill for over a mile and ballroom dancing three times per week for and hour. I do not experience chest pains during exercise- actually it generally feels a little better during exercise. I'm am still nervous because I know not all nuclear stress tests are 100% accurate. Should I ask for more tests? The cardiologist indicated he did not even need to see me for any type of follow up.... Sorry this is so long; but i am freaking out!,2013,2013,32,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am writing to try to get some information on what might be happening to my partner who experiences significant mood swings/behavioral changes at times. He refuses to go to the doctor so I am wondering if someone here can help me. First some information on his background and condition: Caucasian Male 39 yrs old. 30 Lbs overweight Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tachycardia Former methamphetamine user (used for many years; but has been clean for 10+ yrs.) Binge drinker (1 or 2 times a week) Current medications: Lisinopril (Blood Pressure) Atenolol (Heart Rate) Valium (for anxiety) Insulin injections (Humulin R; N) Basically; his behavior can go from 'normal' (calm; not agitated; clear-headed; etc.) to what I am calling "Altered" in a matter of minutes. During these episodes his behavior will deteriorate where he will gradually start acting like he is intoxicated; even though he has not been drinking. It will begin with slight mood changes and speech changes (such as mild slurring; searching for the correct word; etc.). General mood will be happy and sometimes giddy; unless he becomes agitated by something; which tends to happen very easily. If he becomes agitated or angry then his mood will further decline to belligerent or even violent behavior. He will say hurtful things intentionally and become verbally abusive. This negative mood shift does not always happen. In either case; it seems the only way for him to return to 'normal' is to sleep for 6+ hours. It seems like mentally stressful situations may bring this on; although I have also seen it happen after heavy meals. His Diabetes is not well controlled; and he often has high blood sugar spikes. He also does not take his other medications exactly as prescribed; instead choosing to take them whenever he remembers. He often takes 2 Valium at once; 1 time a day instead of 1 every 12 hours. Sometimes he skips a day. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.,2011,2011,34,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doctor; One of the major troubling symptoms I have been having for the last few years has been breathing difficulties. I am always gasping for breath or feel like I am suffocating. I also have associated jaw locking and muscle spasms especially from the chest upwards. I was always told that it was just anxiety but none of the treatments for anxiety had worked. In fact the breathing techniques my clinical psycologists teach (I have seen 3 ) make me more suffocated. Had been to neurologist and cardiologists for other issues which have been resolved and even had a brain MRI. Now I had been told by my doctor that I am an asthmatic since I had bronchitis when young. But apparently after doing some tests (spirometry??); he mentioned I did not have asthma symptoms. Because of the muscle spasms I thought it had to be then muscular skeletal. I don't have any coughs; nor wheezing and don't have respiratory infections too often either. I am 47 years old - female. My doctor still gave me atenolol for the anxiety and the white coat effect hypertension but I felt more shortness of breath and in fact my blood pressure was higher when I felt panicked and very short of breath. But the last 2 days I applied almost a kind of breathing similar to pursed lip ; where I feel a kind of back pressure in my throat and I can breathe better; there is less muscle spasms/tightness and my posture even is a bit better and I even slept better. I am not a smoker and it is unlikely I have any lung problems . Can a breathing dysfunction cause COPD symptoms and anxiety and tetany like symptoms? I consulted a sleep specialist over these symptoms. He mentioned I did not have typical apnea symptoms but that my throat was very restricted and my jaw was retracted. I am due for the sleep study in 2 months. Please help with some suggestions how to move forward? Thank you,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I'm a 48 yr old female who has been diagnosed with dextrocardia. As far as I know; I've had this condition all of my life and it hasn't affected me in any way. Recently I've begun to have "episodes" that have not been diagnosed at this time. It starts with an ache in the back of my throat and tightening of the chest follows. I feel like I have to take deep breaths to come out of it. The episodes last about a minute and toward the end I have tingling in my hands. I tried not to take deep breaths one time and the back of my head felt like it was going to explode. It's very frightening when It happens and just want to understand what is going on. I have been treated for Acid Reflux but the meds didn't do any good. I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure only when exercising. While I'm at rest my blood pressure is normal. Could the blood pressure be a contributing factor to these episodes? My family physician just started me on 25 mg a day of Atenolol for the blood pressure so I'm not sure yet if this will help or not. I'm afraid that I might have an episode and will not be able to come out of it. These episodes happen randomly; I might go a week without incident or I might have 10 episodes in one day. It wakes me up at night while I'm sleeping and I have to sit on the side of the bed until I'm able to breathe normally. Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks; sunnygirl.,2013,2013,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Over my life time I have fainted 3 times (I am 25). First time was during studying I was standing and answering questions. The second time was when a friend of mine was putting makeup on me; once again I was standing; but I kept moving my legs so I wouldn't lock them. The third time I was in college and I was sitting at a picnic table with some friends and I fainted. I am not sure what caused the fainting either time. All three were completely different and the length was different as well.,2015,2015,25,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26 year old male. The past several months I've been having an issue when standing up. About 10-20 seconds after standing up my heart rate increases for about 5 seconds before settling down. During those 5 seconds I also hear blood rushing through my head pretty loudly and it feels like it is uncomfortable to stay upright. After a few seconds it goes away and I am totally fine. This sensation is much worse at night and almost unnoticeable during the morning.. Upon taking my blood pressure; the systolic pressure seems to go up somewhat (~10 mmHG). That too settles down once it passes; though it may just be flukes in readings..I am unsure. I have been taking atenolol 25mg for a few years now; but I've cut the pill in half and have been on that for close to 6 weeks now. No significant rise in BP has been documented as a result. I have read it could be POTS; orthostatic hypertension or other arrhythmia; and I've read it could be a valve leak; But I don't think so as it is so quick to pass. I have pretty crippling anxiety; and over the past couple weeks I randomly become anxious about my heart. (I had an episode close to 5 years ago where I went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack; when it was just an anxiety attack). I had a stress test; echocardiogram and I even wore a heart monitor. Aside from being diagnosed with PVCs; everything came back fine. I had these tests done because my father had a heart attack when he was 25 and triple bypass in his early 30s; so it needed to be ruled out. I'm thinking a lot of it is my anxiety; but not all of it. The increase in heart rate was happening before my anxiety was triggered and I didn't think much of it. I am a full time student; currently unemployed and living off of student loans. So if I wanted to get these tests done again I would be paying out of pocket. Researching the cost of these tests show that I won't be able to afford even one. I'm afraid and worried and it has been affecting my daily life for the past two weeks. Any insight will help.,2015,2015,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have two aneurysms (ascending aortic; and pulmonary) that are under the watchful care of a cardiologist. Recently I have begun to have some almost daily sharp headaches; as the result of orgasm. Does having an aneurysm or two in one location of the body indicate that you are prone to them; and should I see a doctor about the headaches I'm having? They are pretty bad when they kick up; and have had the same kind of headache without additional 'inducement'. I had unchecked hypertension for many years; possibly my entire life up until the first detection of the aortic aneurysm at which time I was put on atenolol. I've seen some references to one being prone to them; and thus they can form anywhere; and my concern is that I may have a a cerebral aneurysm and not know it; outside of the severe headaches I mentioned. What are your thoughts? I don't want to go running to the doctor for every little thing. ~Dave,2013,2017,51,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am an 80 year old asian male. I am 171 cms 165 lbs suffering from hypertension for the last 2 months.When I wake up in the morning my BP is around 180/100 but pulse is around 70.I have been taking Norvasc 5mg with RAN-Atenolol-50 mg but my BP does not come down. I never experience any symptoms nor do I have any water retention. I have also got my blood works done sometime back and had elevated levels of Triglycerides and am taking Rosuvas 5 mg for that for almost 4 months. In the same test my BUN Creratine levels were OK with my GFR around 82. However strangely when I take paracetamol with glucose my BP comes down to 140 levels and my pulse is stable around 75. Also when I do some exercise my BP tends to be normal. I also suffered from Wet Pleuresy as a young man in the 60's due to which I have a collapsed lung. Of late aprrox 1.5 years ago I have been feeling stiffness on my left chest side for which I do some stretching excersice. A recent spirometry showed my right lung to be OK.,2017,2017,79,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on April 20; 1998 at 13:31:17: In Reply to: High Blood Pressure posted by Vila Hall Sr. on April 19; 1998 at 23:06:39: I have been diagnosed as having high blood pressure; but it is only high when I am at the doctors office. I have told two doctors that it is never high any other time. They insist it is and have proscribed fosinopril and atenolol; alsoterazosin which I had to quit taking because of some side effects. I am 77 years old and in the best of health except for arthritis. Am never sick; not even a headache. Can work hard without getting fatigued and am a little overweight. My blood pressure away from the doctors office is usually around 140/70; but at the office is 170/80. My question is; do I have high blood pressure And must I have to take this medicine? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Vila: High blood pressure is a leading cause of strokes. It can also cause heart attacks; kidney failure; and vision problems. New research suggests that it may contribute to dementia and cognitive loss in the elderly. Even mild degrees of high blood pressure can lead to problems over time. One of the problems with high blood pressure is that it can take years for the damage to become evident. All that time you may have no symptoms. That is why high blood pressure is sometimes called the "silent killer." Some people have "white coat hypertension;" which means that their blood pressure is normal except when they are in the doctors office. While this is less of a problem than sustained high blood pressure; it is still abnormal. Whether to treat white coat hypertension with medications is a trickier issue. At a minimum; patients with white coat hypertension should be advised to switch to a low salt diet; to start exercising regularly; and to lose weight if obese. These simple measures are sometimes enough. If someone is overweight; sometimes even a few pounds of weight loss can suffice. If the blood pressure remains elevated (even if only in the doctors office); many cardiologists would elect to start medications; especially if the blood pressure is very high. If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a cardiologist at desk F15.

Atenolol+hypertension,I'm taking 10 mg of Propanolol 2 times a day for anxiety related tachycardia. I take that dose since a while now. At first I was doing ok; the Propranolol was able to reduce my heart rate in the 60's but since 1 month I experience very fast heart rate; pounding heart beat; some skip heart beat; I can feel and see my shirt moving while my heart is beating. Also my blood pressure is normal to low...110/65 to 100/55. I experience this all the time now. Is it because the Inderal (propranolol) stop working on me? If it's the case; why I continue to have the hypertensive effect of the Inderal but not the heart rate reduction? I ask my Cardio Doc but he just switch me to the Lopressor and had the same problem with that med either... Someone can explain how it's possible to have a normal to low blood pressure with a pounding heart rate and a fast heart rate? I was also use to have orthostatic hypotension shortly after my Inderal dosage was increase but now I dont have it. Thanks -;),2011,2012,36,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having "unexplained" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always "pounding;" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia. My grandmother on the same side: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia. Both treated with atenolol. My grandmother on my Father's side got atenolol induced lupus. So did I.,2010,2010,21,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Can anyone shed some light on Hyperbeta adrenergic syndrome. I have been suffering from constant sinus tachycardia and with it high bp. I have undergone extensive tests (including thyroids) and they can't find a cause; but it all kicked off after giving birth; I read an archive post on here from a lady called Roberta; she said her daughter had the same symptoms as me even down to the severe weight loss and that it was all after the birth; it stated that she had sinus tachy; with it high bp and that she had become very thin and weak like myself. I read the posting on medhelp.com about a woman who's daughter of the same age as me had it in 1999 but there was not much mention of the condition of hyperbeta blah blah. On wikipedia it is related to post traumatic stress. I have adrenalin racing round me all the time; and am on beta blockers and have been prescribed SSRI's also. I developed a fear of giving birth; then of course; I had to give birth; I was relieved after the birth but there was so much adrenalin whooshing round me that I literally could not sleep at all for three days after the birth; I had; on the first night conditioned myself not to sleep after the birth. After that I started sleeping normally; but of course; was using babycentre forums to chat to other mums who had been supporting me and I supporting them through our pregnancies. Then... one of the Mums got a nasty infection a few weeks after the birth; followed by another. Then I got a tooth infection and had gone from fear of birth; to fear of infections. I then stopped eating - fear of getting more food stuck down the gap where my wisdom tooth has not quite come through properly which has caused 5 infections through the pregnancy and that one after the birth. I tried to eat on the other side but was so nervous that I couldn't swallow properly. I would have literally a mouthful a night. As well as that I then noticed I had got a womb infection like my friends and was "crapping myself" about it. I was convinced it was bad; because I had looked up the name of the infection and saw what its complications were; I was ULTIMATELY terrified! It was a nasty one. I was given antibiotics and then took another swab test which said it was all clear. But I was not convinced; I had developed other symptoms and was convinced it had become a secondary infection. I noticed I was getting petechaie; flushing; my blood pressure was going up; and more and more symptoms arose. I was getting severe pain in my pelvic area and was in and out of the doctor's on a daily basis in sheer panic. I then caught a virus that was going round; shortly after I developed a painful rash on my legs; then the rash disappeared but I felt weak and drained. I was still not eating. I had not noticed that I had lost weight by this point. I then noticed my skin had gone very pale and transparent; I could see all my veins; I felt weak; my breathing was weak. Something; to me; was very wrong. I felt like my muscles were wasting. I then caught another virus; a bad one this time; it was sinusitis with a throat thing. I could not breathe properly. I had also been crying a lot with anxiety. One night I laid on the bed coughing and my lungs were literally spasming; forcing breath out; it was terrifiying. I could feel the congestion daily working its way down onto my chest. I had earache and my sinuses were heavy. I could feel this tight band around my middle all day one day. My mouth was full of sores when I had tried to eat. I was in a mess. I literally one night ran down to the doctors in fear and when he checked my bp and heart rate he immediately admitted me because they were both sky high. Only to be told after lots of blood tests and chest x ray that my problem was psychiatric! The heart rate never calmed down; I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia; I then got lots of pvcs and pacs etc... and developed an arrhythmia also. I was referred to the cardiologist who said it was stress but has booked me for an echo. Meanwhile my symptoms got worse; I noticed the weight loss and I eventually weighed myself; I was 8 stone; from 10 and a half stone in 2 months! I had lost all my body fat/muscle mass. I was bony; pale and my veins were popping up all the time. I had gone greyish white in colour; dark circles under my eyes. I was back in and out of the doctor's convinced it was physical; my fingernails went bluish; I developed fungal infections in my toenails and feet; I was in pain all of the time in my joints (my joints even went red). I was tested for everything and tests came back normal each time. (thyroids; blood counts; blood cultures; serum levels; electrolytes; esr; ACE; PTH; glucose; you name it) the only levels that have been out recently are my FSH and LH which are both elevated but that can happen in a normal cycle and I was due my period when I had them done so they have to be repeated. I have since developed neurological symptoms and I am very scared; I have asked for an MRI but have been refused. (I was granted a referral recently by another doctor but my doctor put a stop to it; insisting it is purely psychiatric). I also have suspected ME which doesn't help. So; after babbling on like that (sorry); is there a chance that it actually IS psychiatric? Has my living in constant fear caused this? Is my adrenalin whooshing round all day every day? Before birth; my normal bp was 100/60 the highest it went was 110/60. It has always been like that. Now; on the beta blockers; it's 130/80! Can someone give me some advice?,2007,2007,28,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently have been awakening at night with an overwhelming feeling of adrenaline rushing through my body then my heart begins to race. I have seen a cardiologist and was put through an excercise stress echo test. All was fine my heart rate reached 180 bpm and was sinus tach. No blockages were found and test was normal; EKG was also normal. I'am currently wearing a 30 day event monitor and at present the racing heart has been showing up as PAT's with rates up to 176 bpm. My cardiologist said that he would put me on the beta blocker 100mg Toprol XL to help alleviate this. The only problem is that I'am a 35yo female 145lbs no hx of high cholesterol; b/p normally runs 100/60 and at times even lower than this. My resting heart rate is usually 68-72 bpm. I'am an LPN and I'm currently working on getting my RN in school; my brother was recently diagnosed with Lung Cancer and just 3 weeks ago my 52yo sister died suddenly. Not to mention I am a mother of 2 ages 4 and 7. I have explained this to my Cardiologist and he still says that it is the PAT's that are causing my anxiety not my anxiety causing the PAT's. I'm concerned about taking medication that will lower my B/P more than it already is. This is begining to effect my life drastically. I'm waking up at night often as many as 4x with my heart pounding; feeling breathless; and shaking all over. It is starting to effect my daily life to the point that I shake much of the time during the day. I have a constant feeling of anxiety and adrenaline jolts. I have to do something; A just don't know what. Should I take the medication,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 22 year old male and I need some advice. Suddenly on November 14; 2007; My heart rate spiked through the roof while showering; previous to that my heart rate was elevated for an hour or so. For the last year and a half I've had bouts with sporadic tachycardia and palpitations; I noticed it mostly after eating. The more I ate it seemed worse. Anyways getting back to this. When I even move around a bit (even lying down) my heart rate elevates rapidly and when I stand up it goes up to about 160+. I was in the trauma unit of my local hospital a few weeks ago as my heart rate would not go below 120 for about 2 hours. I am on 25mg Atenolol 2x/day right now for a total of 50mg; and it has helped but the symptoms breakthrough after anywhere from 2-8 hours. It varies. I'm also on 20mg of Paxil and have been for about 8 months and 2mg of Lorazepam (Ativan). I have had about a dozen ECG's and echocardiagram a holter monitor and everything is fine on them. I (like an idiot) stopped paxil abruptly about 2-3 months ago because I didn't want to be on it anymore; and I started getting bad palpitations. I went back on it and the palpitations settled down but came back after about a week or so; and then everything has seemed to go downhill after that. Any ideas on what is causing this? Like I said when I wasn't on Atenolol when I would even move a little my heart would go up considerably; and if I tried to stand up and walk around; it went to 160+ beats. I get hypertension with it as well; but feel weak. It is a little better with the Atenolol though. I'm just extremely worried and want to know if this will go away or what. I'm scared out of my mind as when there is no pills to at least help a bit; it completely disables me.,2007,2007,21,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi All; I am a 28 year old male; very active until onset of arrhythmia 2 years ago. I noticed arrhythmia 2 years ago after long nights of drinking; coffee during day and 100 hour work weeks (wall street). My heart would 'double' it's beats for 30 seconds and then go back to normal. I didn't think much of it at the time but then one morning after a heavy drinking session I had a terrible episode where I had a bunch of dropped and coupled beats in chaotic rhythm of no real organization that turned into a very rapid tachycardia (250-300bpm) for 3-5 minutes. Never any pain/dizzyness other than what I would expect from severe mental distress (and I've had a terrible time convincing the non-MD's that it's NOT a panic attack..I have several MD's in my family and I know the difference). After a few more episodes during exercize; I went in and saw a doc that said I'd be fine. I didn't trust him so went for a second opinion to Dr. Anthony Aizer at NYU. He is amazingly diligent; patient and willing to walk you through your issues. They did find some 'likely benign' issues and performed a Cavotricuspid Isthmus ablation to cure the CVNRT (made the pathway singular to cure the circuitous problem that made me go into rapid heart rhythm) and found an area that could be generating spontaneous pulses but since they had me on the table for 9 hours; decided to leave it for another day. Things were pretty good for a while but I never did get back to exercizing as I would often have skipped beats as I came down from 150bpm to 120bpm. No more drinking alcohol. But then last week; after a lot of stress and coffee the previous month; I got a bunch of extra or dropped beats; I'm guessing PVCs (feels like a 'ka-chunk' in my chest) a few times a minute; maybe 100 times per hour. It really distresses me and I immediately jump up; get my shoes on and head for the er. I've been admitted once and have slept in the waiting room 3 times in the past week. Seems the only way I can get to sleep is to take 50mil benzodiazapine and wait until I'm so exhausted that I don't care if my next beat is my last. And this is a circuitous feedback loop: tired at work > poor performance > lose money > get angry > cant relax > have pvc > get tired > tired at work etc... No doubt that there is a psychological element but I know it's also largly physiological. And I've gotten good at calming myself down but even when I'm very relaxed I get them. I have had no (knock on wood) pvc's tonight as Doc Aizer perscribed some Atenolol. I can usually feel when the jump is going to come (I'm only guessing that it's a pvc) and think it definitely has something to do with adrenal uptake. I can feel a certain undescribable 'queezyness' in my chest sometimes for a split second before as if a chemical were injected (and this is from no aparent stimulus) and then get the jumped beat. I can feel the electricity swallowing my heart muscle in a quick gulp. Can anyone put my mind to ease that this is likely nothing serious? Logically; I should not worry. I have one of the best electrophysiologists in the country on my case and he's explored the inside of my heart in finest detail; has done every test; and knows what is most likely wrong. But I had a non-biological uncle who died at 22 of sudden cardiac death and cause was never found (and his father was a top sergeon who made sure of a proper autopsy). I just don't quite understand what makes the beats keep coming and am scared that they will spontaneously stop all together or that they'll go into overdrive or that one pvc will turn into a long strand. It's sort of comical when the er doc says "you won't need to come back unless you pass out" and it's that assymetry of outcomes that worries me: either its ok or we'll know it's not because you'll be dead. And this is where it's definitely a mind block for me: it's almost like I have PTSD from the whole experience. Do people die from these skipped beats? I'm sure there are a few unsolved cases but what generally makes structurally healthy people die from arrhythmia other than drugs? Thanks for any advice; opinion or comment. Best Regards; Me,2009,2009,28,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's "Chest AP/sitting" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?,2009,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted by NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia.

Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10"); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem? Or am I just turning into a medical basket case? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 11; 1999 at 10:37:10 Dear NCW You are not a medical basket case. If your blood pressure is 150/100 when you are just sitting around; it is probably much higher when you exercise and especially high when you are weight lifting. Any heavy weight lifting (or exercise) is probably a very bad idea until your blood pressure is under better control. You should also see a specialist in hypertension - either a cardiologist or a nephrologist (kidney doctor) to be evaluated for certain uncommon disorders that can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure); but can be cured. This testing involves blood tests and perhaps a kidney ultrasound. I think this would be very important. Furthermore; once your blood pressure is under better control; if you symptoms on exercise persist; you should be evaluated for coronary artery disease. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to write back. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Specific questions should be addressed to your own doctor.

Posted by NCW on June 15; 1999 at 15:07:15 I've been tested for pheochromocytoma; carcinoids; heart problems; and had a renogram in January. What kind of testing would a nephrologist add? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 16; 1999 at 16:58:36 Dear NCW I did not realize that you already had an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension. A nephrology evaluation would not add anything at this point. Some causes of hypertension that are overlooked are alcohol and tobacco use; illicit drug use; steroid use; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (ibuprofen). I hope this has been useful.

Atenolol+hypertension,I'm starting to think that the increase of my pvc's literally from 10 a day to 300 could be the beta blockers I'm on; as anyone every heard of this happening? If so why?,2010,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm dealing with tachycardia arrhytmia since more than 2 years now. My Cardilogist at first said it was dysautonomia and POTS and blame also my severe anxiety and was put on a beta blocker; propranolol 20 mg day. At first it was working on to stop the tachycardia but with time the effect wear off and had to increase my dose and then it was lowering too much my blood pressure so my Cardiologist switch me on another beta blocker... I try several ones; bisoprolol; nadolol; timolol; pindolol; acebutolol... All of those fails to control the tachycardia. In those 2 years; I start having more and more heart related symptoms. Chest pain; jaw pain; left arm pain; exercise intolerance; dizziness; vertigo; intestine problems; low energy physically and mentally... I have severe anxiety (panic with agoraphobia; somatisation; GAD; social anxiety). My anxiety is not well control; I'm med sensitive and can't take antidepressants like Paxil; Lexapro or even older ones like imipramine... 1 mg of Paxil send me to the ER and same for Lexapro; didn't had problem with both drugs before and took them for my anxiety for years. I'm on a high dose of clonazepam 7 mg day; I'm addicted and do a very slow tapering withdrawal... Will take years to get off the clonazepam. I also deal with many panic attacks every day; can't get out th house; can't stay alone; everything trigger heart related symptoms like tachycardia or chest pain; a loud sound; music; too much people's around me... My nervous system seem to be overactive... I'm always sick; have chronic headache; heart is pounding in my chest all the time even when my heart rate is normal; droop of blood pressure or high blood pressure; feeling very hot all the time but can't sweat; can't exercise or just walk cause of my low energy and no physical endurance... I saw my Cardiogist 2 weeks ago; he look at my last holter monitor results and said it was anxiety and said that I may have dysautonomia but probably cause of the anxiety... I was stable on 10 mg x 3 of propranolol day for the last 7 months but the tachycardia was not under control at all... He suggest to RX 25 mg x 2 day of metoprolol. I start taking the metoprolol 2 weeks ago. I feel awful! Not only its not helping the tachycardia; but it make my anxiety worse. I have a migraine with throbbing pain in my head since I start it 2 weeks ago. I have more chest pain and left arm and hand are numb most of the time. My jaw hurt and all my teeth also. I have insomnia; have some vision change; my energy level is even lower than on the propranolol. I also feel depression... The propranolol don't do that... I feel so awful that I decrease the dose to 12.5 mg every 12 hours insistead of 25 mg every 12 hours but even with a lower dose I feel very bad. I'm the only one here who have problems with the metoprolol or brand name lopressor? It's the immediate release one; not the XL... I call my Cardio Doc and ask to be put again on the Propranolol but he don't return my phone call back. The only one beta blocker that I never try is the bystolic; it's new in the Canada but too expensive for me. I also hear that for anxiety it's bad? Well share you're experiences with the metoprolol vs propranolol... It can't be all in my head; I mean the side effects from the metoprolol are horrible...,2013,2013,37,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Have you ever seen a pt with neurocardiogenic syncope become so dizzy it was incapicitating and completely altered their balance? I have hypotension; with SBP in the 60's (on Florinef o.1mg qMWF and Proamatine 2.5mg tid) at times in the am before I even get out of bed. I have POTs and am on Atenolol for HR control which does not help my low BP. I was recently in the hospital with the above problem and am still going to PT working on recovering my balance. The exact cause of the dizzyness etc has not been pinpointed. Speculation is a virus in my inner ear. But I think it is somehow related to my BP issues. I have been having problems for a year now; and the symptoms came on suddenly after a viral illness last year; unusual fatigue; lightheadedness; HR to 150 without much exertion and and increase in symptoms with high HR. I have been to the syncope clinic there and recently had a hemodynamic test. What I really want to know is if it is possible that the problems I am having now have anything to do with the syncope; couldn't possibly; or maybe are contributing to make the problem worse. I also have been having chest pains; which everything in the world has been ruled out. I had a right heart cath which showed mild pulm HTN (then Florinef was decreased from qd to the present qMWF) and they ruled out my gall bladder. I was started on neurontin thinking it was a neurologic pain; and the pain had diminished. I stopped taking it to see if that was helping; and the pain did return after one day. Could this "neurologic pain" be related to the neurocardiogenic syncope?,2003,2003,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night. How worried should I be?,2009,2009,29,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending. Thanks,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think? Thanks; Renne,2011,2011,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 25 year-old female college student. I've had migraines since I was 13. I was (finally) diagnosed with intracranial hypertension at 21; Chiari Malformation at 22; and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome at 23. I've seen neurologists in New Jersey (my home state); Philadelphia; New York; and Maryland. I had a craniotomy/decompression; duraplasty; and laminectomy of C1 three months after my Chiari diagnosis at a well known hospital. It has been three years and I consider the surgery an utter failure. I am no different than I was before (with the added benefit of a psuedomeningocele!). My last cine flow (post surgery) shows I still have a blockage. I have tried more medications than I can count and they either do nothing or the side effects are so terrible that I can't stay on them long enough to find out it they'll work. I seem to be stuck in a cycle right now where I go see the neurologist; get a new med to try; have it fail; and have to deal with the migraines for another 6 months to a year until my next visit. Is this how things normally go once surgery has failed? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated - and please; if a med has worked for you; let me know! I go back to see my neurologist in a couple of weeks (only the third time; she just took over my case because my old neurologist was so busy I could barely ever see him) and I want to be prepared. -Kulili-,2011,2011,25,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have a confession..... I relapsed; but on a small scale. As some of you may know; I am addicted to Percocets and quit over the long holiday of Christmas and New Years. I started work at a VERY demanding job (in politics) that has me working non-stop 14-16 hours per day right after I quit. I couldn't do it. I could not cope. I was having panic attacks and was not able to do my job. I went back on the pills. However; it's not as bad as it sounds. I'm taking 1 pill to 1 1/2 pills per day so I can do my job. I simply tried to quit at the wrong time. I also sought out a doctor to help me. He has diagnosed me with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and he put me on Lexapro which combats both diseases. He thinks I have been self medicating with the Percocets and is helping me taper off the Percs while the Lexapro does it's job. The Lexapro has already started working and I am feeling MUCH better and am able to cope on a small dose of Percocets. The first week was terrible; but now my body is adjusting to the lower amount and the Lexapro is kicking; I'm going to taper even more next week. He wants me to stop taking the Percocets all together in six weeks. It's nice to have the support of my doctor. He's also put me on Atenolol for hypertension because I could not STAND the constant pounding of my heart. He put me on low dosages of Xanax to take when I feel a panic attack coming on. I'm happy to report that the pounding heart has TOTALLY stopped thanks to the Atenolol and I am taking less and less of the Xanax every day. The Lexapro is really working. Today was the best day yet! I'm going to try to go without any Percocets at all this weekend and see how I do. I'm getting more familiar with my new job and I believe I am going to be able to quit the Percocets for good on the current plan I am on. I have a vacation coming up on March 6th for nine days. That is my new quit date. So; that's my confession. Please don't judge me.,2008,2009,41,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Normal body weight 115 (30 yr F) but gained 12 pounds in 3 days after start of propranolol. Continued to gain an additional 13 in the next 2 weeks. Began methimazole one-and-a-half weeks after propranolol. I normally eat 1900 calories per day w/moderate activity. Could I have gained 25 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks on that sort of caloric intake? Or is it the medication? DR said I had some fluid retention but made no further comment about the weight gain. Is there something else I can take for hypertension/SVT/sinus tachycardia? Elevated liver enzymes present after 3 wks methimazole usage. TSH and T3 were in normal range as of 2 mo. ago with total T4 still slightly elevated. Wanted to reduce methimazole but DR said no. Why did he say no? Now 2 mo. later and my hair is falling out (800 strands per day in the past 6 wks. and it hasn't slowed down at all); low waking body temp of 95.9F with shivering in the AM; hypnic jerks before bed or when sitting for extended periods at desk; occasional fever-like symptoms (flushed/heated body; sweating; coughing; sore throat) but it's difficult to tell if I even have a fever with the low body temp; and persistent sore throat. Why didn't DR reduce methimazole when my labs were so close to normal? I feel this all could have been avoided if he had just agreed to reduce medication. What do I do now? I need guidance; please! Thank you for listening!,2012,2012,29,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been told that they are recommending lower blood pressures more than before. I am 30 years old male and when the nurse did my blood pressure at work it was about 150/90. This was on two weeks apart. They told me to go to the doctor and then it was 134/76 so he didn't do anything. My blood pressure has been up for about 10 years. I work out and lift weights and do aerobic exercises and am very muscular. I am 6'4" tall and weigh 240 lbs. My parents have a blood pressure device that I use when I am over there and the blood pressure stays around 140-150/90 or about there. Should I go back to that doctor or go to a cardiologist who is a expert in blood pressures? What blood pressure should I have at my age? What else can I do? I do aerobics watch caffiene and diet and am trying to loose weight.,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 52 y.o. w/f who has been taking atenolol 50 mgs. and 40 mgs.lasix. Recently I was under a good deal of stress and was informed that my pressure was running 180/105 and went up from there! Each time my Cardiologist took it it rose until I told him to stop. I tried to explain the stress I have been under and the fact that "I beleive" I am suffering from "white coat" syndrome because I monitor my pressure at home routinely and it is WELL controled! He on the other hand stated that if the BP was up in his offoce he must beleive that it is also up at other times. This being said; he placed me on a starting dose of Avapro; 150 mgs. Several days later I started to have major bouts of depression; very tired; heaviness on my entire left side and also left hand and foot became very cold.I also had frequent palpitations. My head felt like my pressure was elevated but just the oppisite was happening; avg. BP was 116/68. My Internist told me to decrease the medication to 75mgs. and if in a few days I was feeling better then we must assume that these "feelings" were coming from the Avapro. She also stated that she has had other people demonstrate these same "symptoms" however because angiotension II is a new class of medicines there is still very little data available. After 2 days of 75 mgs. I do feel a little better. I am also decreasing the drug again ; in order to discontinue it entirely. Now I guess my question is; "is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME" ? If not; what is one to do when taking additional medication that seem to only agravate the body as a whole? I also recently went through a complete physicial and Cardiolyte Stress test; lipid profile etc; everything was great! Thanks for your help with this matter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear D.L.; Q: Is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME ?. A: "White coat hypertension" has been described as high blood pressure that is only elevated in the doctor' office due to the stress of seeing the doctor. Yes; it does exist but no it does not mean that one does not need medication. The reason for this is that no one (at least no one I know) lives in a totally stress free environment. Therefore whenever one is stressed their blood pressure will be high. It is during those high periods that the damage of hypertension is done. Thus it may be beneficial to see what a "stress" blood pressure is and to treat based on that number.

Atenolol+hypertension,I finally got a chance to post a question here. I posted this a few days ago as a response to someone else's question; but I'd like to get an opinion from an MD on the board as well. The full story is in this URL: http://www.medhelp.org/forums/cardio/messages/35673.html; under the name feelsick2. I'd appreciate if you could read the full story instead of this post. The summaryis as follows: I'm 28; 178 pounds; normal resting blood pressure 115/75; pulse 72. No major health problems before. No heart problems in parents (both alive; 55 yrs old) or grandparents (all passed away around 82 yrs old) One day; woke up with a sore throat and mild fever (99.8); took a TheraFlu (aspirin). Then 2 hours later; started feeling weird; dizzy; started feeling a bit of pulsations in my chest and head. Things started to get worse in 10 mins; and suddenly; my heart was racing; my hands and feet were tingling and numb and I was sweating and flushing. (no chest pain; shortness of breath). Went back home to rest. Major complaint the next couple days were a strong feeling of pulsations INSIDE my head; often in my neck; face; ears and jaw. No pain or headache. Couldn't go to work because these feelings were making me dizzy; After 2 days of rest; one night these pulsations started getting worse again; so that morning I went to my PCP. Since then (it has been 3 months now); I have these pulsations in my head. I have had 2 MRI/MRAs; 2 Chest-x-rays; Cardio consult; Neuro consult; ENT consult; all non-conclusive. The details of these workups are in my long post. Thanks in advance;,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,First of all; thank you for all your responses; they've been very helpful. The event monitor showed only PVC's. The stress echo test looked great except for one thing: The tricuspid valve is leaky. The doctor didn't think it looked too serious. He wants to look at it again in a year. Could this be connected to the PVC's or the painful PVC's? Does it cause anxiety like mitral valve prolaps seems to? Or; could my anxiety have caused the tricuspid problem? What is a typical prognoses for someone with this? I also get pressure in my face and sometimes dizziness: Could this be related to the tricuspid? As mentioned in the original post; I have had breathing trouble for the past four years. Could my breathing difficulty be pulmonary hypertension resulting from the tricuspid anomaly? When breathing is tough; I'll get the erg for a deep breath; I'll try to take it; but I wont get that satisfied feeling. There's no fluid in the lungs; no wheezing and no asthma. In fact; doctors have not been able to give a diagnoses. My breathing gets better with regular exercise; and; when it's been bad enough for the ER my oxygen saturation has always been normal. Except for what I've mentioned here; I don't seem to have other symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid regurgitation. Or; does my breathing difficulty sound anxiety related? Thanks again for your help Tim,1999,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 27 year old man from Indiana. For the past three years I have been to two family doctors; two neurologists and three cardiologists because I have fainting spells on average every 4-6 days. From November 1998 when they started to January of 2001; they have maintained this "schedule"; however; on January 15th; 2001; I had a fainting spell and when I "woke up;" I had lost feeling and function of both of my legs. This has continued with every blackout I have had since. I do have warning signs before the blackouts occur. I get dizzy; lightheaded; and have blurred vision. The last sign I have before I faint is tingling or numbness in my hands and feet. These warning signs happen every time before I have a blackout. The blackouts; according to those people around me when I have them; last 10-15 minutes. Periodically; my feet will turn blue for no reason and this does not happen during a blackout or just before one either. The diagnosis for my problem is neurocardiogenic syncope; although the cardioloigsts are not confident in this because I do not recover quickly after a blackout. It takes up to 48 hours sometimes to recover from a blackout. The current cardiologist I have started me on beta blockers (Atenolol first and then Betaxolol); which have caused a complete loss of energy. The cardiologist took me off of those and put me on Florinef; so that my blood vessels would remain dialated. This medication has caused my blackouts to occur more frequently. The next stage the cardiologist has suggested involves a drug that causes hypertension and can do damage to my heart; which he is retisent to put me on because of my young age and because I suffer from hypotension. For your information; I have had the following tests; all which have come back negative: EKG; EEG; MRI on my brain and my thoracic spinal cord; Doppler Arterial Flow on my legs and arms; blood tests for my thyroid and diabetes; treadmill test; and electrocardio catheters checking my heart and valve function. I did have two tilt table tests; both of which came back positive for neurocardiogenic syncope; which is the only test I had that has come back positive. During the EEG; my first cardiologist found I had an arrhythmia. I would appreciate any suggestion you may have on what is wrong with me. If my current cardiologist does not put me on the drug that causes hypertension; then he has suggested sending me to the Mayo Clinic or to Cleveland Clinic; which is why I am posting this question. Thank you for reading this question and I would appreciate any information you could offer to shed light on this problem I am having. Jay27,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I have MVP and episodes of SVT. I am taking Verapamil and Zoloft. Recently; I read a report in the American Journal of Medicine that listed Zoloft as a drug that may prolong the cardiac QT interval and cause risk for an arrythmia.

Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy several months ago; that is thought to be caused by taking a new biologic injection for Psoriatic Arthritis. I have chest pains daily; along with shortness of breath on exertion. My angiogram showed all the heart arteries to be clear; so why am i still having chest pains? Also; all my cardiologist has treated me with is Altace 10mg once a day. Is my cariologist being aggressive enough? He seems to think my chest pains are not of concern since my angiogram showed clear arteries. I've been off the biologic medicine since late September and have not seen any improvement in my chest pains and shortness of breath. Do you think my heart will return to normal size and function? Thank you for your time.,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?,2009,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,My husband is being treated for hbp since June/98. He has been on both ace inhibitors and beta blockers from low to high doses. At this point his pressure has remained unchanged. It averages between 150/95 - 170-112. He is on the highest dose of atenolol(?). He has been on 100mg. for approx. 1 week now with no change. I have several concerns at this point. His weight; diet is good. He moderately exercises; stress level is high. 1. He may have had undetected hbp for any length of time previous to June. 2. Since June there has been no change which is prolonging the condition with possible effects? 3. What normally causes resistance to the medication and what could be causing it and could there be permanent organ damage? I am concerned about the time lag and am not sure is he should be seeing a specialist at this point. Your advice is appreciated!,1998,1998,,

No one seems to know the exact cause and he's been told to take one asprin daily and to avoid alcohol and caffeine.Should we be concerned?

Will taking medication for stress help because no matter how hard he trys not to let things upset him they still do. Also; we have always had suspicions that he is ADHD could this be a factor. My husband has always been a strong hard working man; but; I've notice in the past year to year and a half he's not been himself he complains often about not feeling well and doesn't feel like doing as much as before all this. I guess what I'm looking for is answers to many questions; like should he not do the job he's been doing for the past 20yrs which is extremely hard and dangerous work(he's a iron worker).He was told to avoid beer but he's thinks if he had a few once a month it won't matter is he right.Should he exercise more? What should he life style be like.Is having atrial figrillation and an enlarged heart moe dangerous than having just one of these conditions or is one just a factor to the other. thank you; Paula,1999,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 34 year old female; in relativley good health. I had an episode of tachycardia 5 years ago. My heart rate went up to 140bpm for no reason. It stayed there for 2 hours before I called paramedics. They hooked me up to moniter and said everything was fine; probably PAC? Since then I have had nothing of that nature; it was like a panic attack heart episode that lasted way too long. Heavy and pounding. Three times I have had episodes of bradychardia in the past 5 years; where my heart rate has dropped to 47-57 and I have felt extreme fatigue and once shortness of breath. I also have experienced many times; rapid heart rate after laying down to go to sleep. 90-110bpm. This was not as pounding as the tachycardia; While working as a waitress; sometimes by the end of the shift; I would get rapid heart rate of up to 112-115; and could not make it go away until I had slept all night.Also at times I will feel my heart flutter; like a series of skipped beats; this too is during times of stress; usually when I try to rest. Various doctors that I have seen have told me it is nothing to worry about. I have not seen a cardiologist. I was just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist; who suggested that i get in to see a cardiologist right away. Now I am afraid and anxious that there may be something horrible wrong with me. I have always been prone to panic and anxiety. Have had panic attacks in the past. And it does seem to have some connection with emotional stress. Does this sound like anything textbook; or is my heart just reacting to stress? Thank you; Worried Molly,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My hunsband had mild chest discomfort in sept 2009 and we did echo cardiogram ; it came to be normal with mild left ventricular hipertrophy and the doctor said it will reverse by itself if BP is well controlled. He has hypertension and diabetes. We did an echo april 2010 and no more left ventricular hypertrophy.. But looking at his report; the measurement of IVSD and PWD have decreased to 0.9 from 1.2. But the over all chamber size of LV and LA has increased from 2009 to 2010 as below. in sept 2009 LV diast 4.0 LV syst 2.2 LA 2.3 in april 2010 LV diast 4.1 LV sys 3.5 LA 3.7 Im afraid about the increase rate in one year. He has family history of cardiomyopathy(Not his parents or siblings but cousins); though he does not have it. his EF remains same at 60% from 2009 and 2010. Is he at the risk of developing any kind of cardiomyopathy? Will the LV and LA size get back to normal? what ways can we control it? He changed the BP medicine in between these 2 echos from Enalapril to Cardace.But changed back to Enalapril now.,2010,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 47 year old male who has been dealing with PVC's off and on for years. I've never smoked; drink rarely; don't do drugs; take 50mg of Atenolol (have for years). Recently they've become increasingly stronger and more frequent. I've had every test done that can be thought of... Holter (24 hour) monitor; Event Monitor (30 day); Echo; MRI; Stress; Tilt Table; Angiogram; EP study; blood work; etc. I've spoken with two Cardiologists and have been told that my heart is structurally normal and that the PVC's are benign. Fine; they're benign to you; but they're not benign to me!! I'm the one that has to deal with them. When I get them two; three; four times in a row; I feel like it might be my time to "check out". Hard to get to sleep or just function normally from day to day when you're not sure if your heart is going to continue to beat erratically or at all. I do try to keep in mind what the Cardiologists say as they see cases like mine each and every day; so they have more real life experience to draw on; however I still freak out slightly when it feels like there's a soccer game going on in my chest. Anyone else share my concerns or have similar stories?,2013,2013,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Can you stop CCBs abruptly? I have been on a fast acting CCB for about 9 months (felodipine 10 mg). I despise this class of medicines. I do not have a good cardiologist at all (a real chucklehead). According to the medical literature I should not be taking CCBs. I have substituted a long acting CCB starting last night (amlidine (sp); but at .5 mg. What does anyone think? I also doubled my beta blocker; atenolol from 50 to 100mg. Going to watch BP and heart rate.,2007,2007,54,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have been taking Inderal for 2-3 years. I have recently become pregnant. (1-2months) I take 10mg total a day. A half a pill in the morning; and a half a pill at night. This seemed to help all my symptoms with MVPS. I spoke to my cardiologist and he said he thinks I should not take it anymore. He told me I should wean myself off of it. I took 4 half pill a day for four days; then one-half a pill every other day for four days. I didn't take one yesterday at all and today I took my last half a pill. Should I get some symptoms? Will my heart rate speed up? And how long will it take to get out of my system? Will I have a heart attack? I am quite worried. The cardiologist is the one who told me how to wean. Also; the nurse at the gynecologist office said I could continue to take it. I would think the cardiologist would know better. Could you please give me your opinion? Thanks!,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was "a little off" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested? Lots of questions. : ) Regards; Michelle,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female with a history of PVC's. They were very bad about 23 years ago---especially during pregnancy. I haven't had any bad episodes for approximately 8 years. A few months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and I am now on Inderal---20mg. three times a day. This seems to control my blood pressure. After I had been on the Inderal for about a month I began to have the PVC's again. It seems like these episodes are as bad; if not worse; than during pregnancy. I figured that these were triggered by the Inderal; but my doctor didn't think so. She did order a holter monitor and she called a few days later to tell me that I needed to see a cardiologist. She did not go into detail about the results---she just said that she saw enough to know that I needed to see someone else. It seems likely to me; that somehow the Inderal is aggravating the arrhythmia. I have learned from this website that my PVC's are likely to be vagally mediated. They are worse when I rest from activity and when I lay down at night. Based on what I have told you--Is there a possiblity that Inderal could be somehow causing or aggravating this problem and what would be a good alternative? Are there other BP meds that I should also avoid under these circumstances? Thank you so very much for any insight you might be able to offer!,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 43 year old male; never smoked and about 25lbs overweight in spite of exercise. Since mid-December; I've had PACs and have been subsequently diagnosed with ectopic atrial tachycardia. The problems started when I had a cold and took allegra-d. I had a lot of premature beats which disappeared within 24 hours. The problem has been reoccurring in spite of my elimination of caffeine and other stimulants. I also had a couple episodes of tachycardia that would last for a few seconds; stop; start again and thus resulting in a pretty chaotic heartbeat. I had a nuclear stress test; echo; event monitor and all tests are normal. Also thyroid function; potassium levels; etc are normal. I'm currently taking cardizem LA 120mg and atenolol xl 50mg. I continue to have skipped beats but no real events of tachycardia. I met with an EP and he said that I should consider a PVI but scared me quite a bit by talking a lot about the amount of risk of a PVI vs. other types of ablation. He also implied that my condition will most likely progress into afib. So 2 questions: 1) Am I more or less likely to experience afib given the above facts? 2) Can you provide some info on the risks of PVI vs. anti-arrythmic drugs (assuming my condition worsens and I have to make a choice)? Thanks in advance for your help; Barry,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I have Graves and am just wondering how many beats per minute I should be ( I never paid attention to it before). My resting pulse rate is always between 90 and 105. (in bed at night. ) When I go for a brisk 20 min walk it is between 150 and 170. I am a 25 yr old normal weight female. Also - I hear my heart beat pounding in my ears all day - It's loud and irritating. Is this normal???,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,About 5 months ago I was diagnosed with Depression NOS and Anxiety at Mayo Clinic. Evaluations by two psychiatrists and a therapist have revealed no "emotional" cause - Mayo Clinic's best "guess" was a viral infection causing a biological inbalance. I am currently going to therapy to deal better with stress and anxiety. For the chemical inbalance; I have been taking Paxil along with Trazadone for sleep. The problem is that the Paxil works great for a few weeks then seems to "poop out". I am steadily improving but keep having dips back that are starting to scare me. My Dr. first added desipramine to boost the Paxil (it helped at first; then made me extremely tired and stopped working in 4-5 weeks. He then tried Welbutrin but it made me way too nervous so it was stopped in a few days. Then a few weeks ago he increase my dosage of Paxil to 30 mg. For about two weeks I felt great - back to my old self. Then about five days ago I started feeling really sleepy and groggy and all my energy was zapped. I tried to relax and thought it would go away - but it hasn't. Its hard to work and get back to normal life with this sleepiness. I think the 30 mg of Paxil may be too much. (I take 1/2 at 7am and 1/2 at 7pm and sleep great). Now I am getting nervous that I am never going to be back to normal. Do you think I have given Paxil enough time to work? I am considering asking my Dr. to let me try Celexa as I have heard good things about it. What would be involved with switching meds? Your opinions on all this would be greatly appreciated.,2002,2002,,

In addition to local cardiologist had second opinion at CC in April. Take following meds for prevention and for lowering existing normal levels--- Atacand 24 mg Atenolol 25mg Vytorin 10/20 No side effects:Cholesterol is 121 with LDL @62 and HDL at 40; Trig---97 BP: 105/65 I speed walk 4 miles per day; stopped weight lifting---lift light weights 3 X per week. Mostly mediterrian diet; 2 glasses of wine a day and my one vice---one cigar a week!

All other aspects of study; including my previousCAT scans; stress test and follow up echo at CC; has my heart in good shape----a valves normal; normal systolic function; although my EF dropped 68 to 50. Of course it is the Holiday weekend so i can't get to my MD so my questions are-- Is is possible for my atriums to enlarge to this degree in 6 months (date of last echo) or is the study read incorrectly? If it is correct--what could be the cause---the typical causes are not evident in my results? I have no symptoms of anything and generaly feel great; but as you know when you get these type of results ; it is like getting hit by a curve ball. Any ideas would be appreciated,2007,2007,58,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,hi...48 yr old female...mild hypertension-on BP meds...atenolol 50 mg 2 x a day...put on that about 12 yrs ago for palpitations. Healthy other than being overweight...and these darn palpitations. Ive had them for so long. They come and go. Ive been thru all the testing...several times. I went quite a while with no palpitations....months and months. Now; they are back. Going thru a stressful time right now in our family with my mother; and a serious illness.... but...right now things have settled down for a bit... My question today is...Ive noticed a sharp increase in my pvs; pacs; in the past few days. The weekend was a stressful one; with not alot of sleep...so I guess I can figure out what brought them on... but boy are they bad today!! I bet I have 20 a minute or so...not every minute... What seems odd about them is that if I get up and walk across the room; or at work; walk across the building; wow; that really brings them on-I can feel it as Im walking. Like always; I have no other symptoms...but just feel the jumping ;and of course; I reach for my pulse....I am an expert pulse-taker; Im sad to say. If I sit for a long period of time; ( we traveled across the state yesterday; so rode in the car all day...) I have a FEW...but when I got out of the car yesterday; and when I walked anywhere today...the palps are just firing up. Its so distressing---I get so upset---which makes it worse...but my gosh; its hard to live with these; as the Drs tell you to; ya know?? I wonder...How long is an echo; ekg; stress test & holter "good" for? I ask; because I had the whollllllle workup in April 08. So; just over a year. It was expensive--- and they made me feel like a hypochondriac...when they were putting the holter on me; the technolgist says...you are having this put on...for palpitations?? Like...that was ridiculous.... I am not in good physical shape---so my stress test was short--but the cardiologist said it was fine--normal--nothing alarming. So..that is my question... anytime I get these back...my first instinct...is to run to the Dr. But really...I dont know that should. Theyve told me they are benign....and to "not worry" about them. Yea. If they only knew how difficult that is.,2007,2009,,Female

Here is a little more information from my physician. Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further. Any interesting research in this area? Many thanks again. Diana.,1999,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7. Also World Journal of Gastroenterology 2005;11(48):7560-7563 has an article on losartan and fibrosis and there are other articles on the Internet.,2009,2009,,Male

Atenolol+hypertension,Before I rush to a doctor and look like a hypochondriac I thought I'd shoot a question here: I woke up this morning and I have been couching/gaging all morning and can taste blood in the back of my throat; I have not coughed up any blood though. I have been trying to quit smoking since 2011 and have been a smoker since 1991. I am also on SR Hydromorphone (Jurnisa) for severe chronic back pain. I am also on 800Mg Carbamazapine (as a Mood stabilizer NOT for Epilepsy) As well as Mirtazepine (for chronic Clinical Depression) And Atenolol for mild Hypertension. Anyhoo; as of this morning I have been hacking up a storm; as of 2 hours from waking up I developed a sore throat (I believe from the hard coughing) I have not coughed anything up but the coughing gets so hard it becomes dry-reacing frequently. And that taste of blood waay down in the back of my throat is ever present after each cough. As I have depression and mood disorder; I don't want to go straight to the doc as quite often individuals with mental health issues don't get taken seriously here in Australia; quite often I would get told "Go to your psychaitrist" as if I am crazy. and in the past I ended up in trouble with serious health issues that went undiagnosed simply because some peanut G.P. thought it was all in my head; until I ended up in hospital sometimes in quite serious condition. So I was wondering if someone who understands this coughing issue could be could shoot me an answer first. I am meant to go to University tomorrow (I am studying for a Psychology Degree) and I want to be at my peak for study if at all possible.,2015,2016,36,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm 53; male; not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol; until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago). I found the combo effective; regular monitoring showed BP controlled; no side effects. about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy; standing up; and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However; dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril; then stopped another quarter; then completely. Monitored my own BP; went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed. However; my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise; and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion; dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff; which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative; although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work. I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'. I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months; and is it a coincidence that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia; and has done a MRI of my head (still await results). I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling; almost numbness; (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse. I don't think I'm going to keel over; but I just cant understand the chain of events. My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down. Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's; yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose. I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks 'your fine'; but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed. Can high blood pressure resolve like this ? Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ? The neurologist has recommended duloxotine; which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :( Thanks for reading,2014,2014,52,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF CARDIO MD - MTR on March 05; 1998 at 15:32:16: In Reply to: heart rate during exercise posted by Ruth Anderson on February 26; 1998 at 01:45:04: : I am a 47 year old female who is severely obese. I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart?

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF Cardio MD-SGM on March 21; 1998 at 13:17:41: In Reply to: palpitations posted by jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: : This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this "defect" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were "shuddering"); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a "click"? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid "leaking" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in "slower motion". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest "rushes" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these "weird" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol. Thank you for your time. _ Dear Jeanette; From your question; I gather that your most significant complaint is palpitations. I will attempt to address this issue and provide some recommendations and reassurance. Palpitations; as you know; often represent premature or "extra" heart beats that arise from the ventricles (PVC's) or the atria (PAC's). In the presence of a structurally normal heart (i.e. no history of ventricular dysfunction or significant coronary artery disease) these irregular beats are benign. I want to reiterate this; because I think it's a crucial point: If a heart is normal; palpitations pose no risk to the patient. I hope that this is reassuring. Many factors such as increased thyroid hormone levels (possibly exacerbated by therapy you were receiving) caffeine; alcohol; cigarettes and other stimulants can increase the incidence of PVC's and PAC's. Often; treatment with beta-blocking medications such as atenolol or possibly calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can reduce the frequency and symptoms of palpitations. Hyperthyroidism can exacerbate or cause palpitations and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias); however its effects are not permanent; and tend to resolve when thyroid hormone levels return to normal. In regards to esophageal reflux; sometimes this can produce palpitations by irritating the atrial chambers of the heart; which lie adjacent to the esophagus. Therapy for reflux includes antacids; H-2 blocking and other drugs like Pepcid or Tagamet; weight loss; and possibly surgical therapy for resistant cases. Sleep apnea can sometimes cause heart rhythm abnormalities; and can produce other complications such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). If you have a history of loud snoring or have been witnessed to stop breathing for intermittent periods during sleep; you may wish to be evaluated for this condition with a sleep study. It appears that you've undergone extensive testing of the heart. I don't believe that repetition of these tests would yield any additional information. One consideration is performing recordings of your palpitations with an event recorder which you could turn on when you're experiencing the problem. This would identify whether you have PVC's or alternatively suffer from an arrhythmia. In either case; an electrophysiologic study of the heart may be helpful. This procedure can sometimes be used to cure arrhythmias; and in some cases can also remove the source of PVC's. Something to consider. Hope I've been of help.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 37 y/o female not overweight; I don't smoke. Not diabetic. My cholesterol and blood sugar were just checked and are good. I have hypothyroidism; but I am on medication and that was recently checked and is within normal limits. I do have asthma and am taking medication for that. Over the past two months I have had the following symptoms. I wake up in the night not quite feeling well. I usually feel a bit weak in my arms and nauseated. Usually I have heart palpitations and chest pain. Then my heart will start pounding and I will usually get up to head for the bathroom because I think I am going to vomit. I feel very weak and am shaking. I then notice my heart is racing. When I take my pulse; it is usually between 160-180. I don't really notice feeling anxious; I am usually half asleep and after the episode passes; I just want to go back to bed. My pulse usually comes back down within 5 minutes. Then I start to get the chills. By the time I am thinking I should call 911; the episode passes I feel dumb about calling 911. I also notice my skin looks funny; kind of a reddish color on my face and arms and my hands and feet are a strange grey color? I have had these symptoms approx. 8 times over the past 2 months and always at night. I do take medication for anxiety. The only symptoms I notice during the day is that I sometimes have shortness of breath and palpitations and sometimes my blood pressure is high. But I figured it was because of my asthma.,2009,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 36; non smoker non drinker; no history of heart disease in family; non excersizing and 40 pounds over weight; female. 11 months ago I developed a terrible chest cold and coughed for months. When I went to the Dr. they found I have high blood pressure ( again... I did in my late 20s but it went away with two children) of 160 over 90. I was put on atenolol. shortly after that; i started having alarming arm and chest discomfort. It was random; both at reat and during excersize. Flash forward to recently; I had an echo that found an slightly enlarged left ventricle. I have terrible heart palps even on the Bystolic; and now; today; I spiked a high BP reading 160 over 100 only 2 minutes into the treadmill; so he ended the test. I was sent home; to wait three weeks for a nuclear stress test. My question is this; why am I home with arm and chest pains? If I am having arm; neck chest and sometimes even jaw discomfort; plus palps; spiking BP; enlarged Lft. ventricle; leaky valve; and dizzy spells; why wasn't I admitted? Why send me home with a blood pressure cuff and tell me to make an appt for a nuclear test in three weeks? He told me the chance of me having ablockage is low; but Im thinking; im fat; im 36... I think theres a pretty good chance right? So I am sitting home; arm hurting every time I exhert myself or try to get a good night sleep hoping I dont have a sudden heart attack... should I go to a new cardiologist? This one seems good; but now Im not sure. Why his blasie attitude; because Im young? thank you!!!!,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky. Being so close to start with means anytime I don't drink enough; get a fever; have diarrhea; sweat too much in the summer heat... then I totally bottom out my bp. At what kind of pressure do other people feel symptomatic?,2008,2009,41,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF Cardio MD-SGM on January 21; 1998 at 17:23:16: In Reply to: Testing for CHF and Angina posted by Ruth on January 18; 1998 at 00:41:55: : I am a 47 year old female with chronic hypertension; right-sided CHF; and angina. Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?). I suffer excruciating headaches from them and have been told I have to live with them until we can find the cause of the angina. Is that true or do I have other options there as well?,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Three weeks ago I had ablation for AV node reentry; and two other sites as well for atrial tachy and extrabeats. Ep said he got it all. Two weeks ago was put on a Loop monitor and my EP said he seen one atrial tachy 16 beats total and a number of sinus tachy; one up to 120bpm and a number of pac's. Well;last nite around 3am I was awakened from a sound sleep with the worst attach ever;even before ablation. I recorded and sent it in. It was beating at 160bpm+ at times with a few missed beats and was unrelenting. They said it looked like Sinus Tachy. The center told me to call my hospital which I did. The doc asked what I had on hand to take. I had an 80mg fast act Verapamil and 240sr Verapamil. I took the 80 and it slowed the heart rate down to the high 80's. Then took the 240mg. My HB is around 75 this am but it took 1 1/2 hours to get there. This no longer sounds like a normal variant of ablation does it? Also; I am to go on 50 mg Toprol 1xday after speaking with EP's office this am. and was told I could take the fast acting verapamil if it got untolerable as well as the Toprol. Can I mix Toprol with Verapamil? I took pinadole (spelling)one time prior to alation and it made my heart beat fast so was told to quit. Will the Toprol work better? What Could this sinus tachy be from. I don't have any other problems that I know of. Could this be a onetime thing due to post ablation? Can a persons heart beat that fast and long with no bad effects? Also; my bp is naturally low 112/58 usually. Can I still tolerate Toprol? Thanks so much for this board!,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; Thank you for taking my questions and for providing this very valuable service. I am a woman who turned 49 years old yesterday. I have a ten year history of panic and GAD that waxes and wanes. Cardiac symptoms; such as tachycardia and "skipped" beats occur when it's high. I have had two echocardiograms; the first showed MVP(mild; but medicate for dental work); the second didn't. These were both performed several years ago. I had a normal holter monitor test last April. I did have some symptoms; but was told holter was "normal." I did not ask any specifics. I have been having increasing bouts of tachycardia and palpitations again. I am also struggling again with my anxiety and I'm in the middle of an awful perimenopause. I am sometimes anemic and have had problems in the past with low potassium. Lab values for each of these was normal last month when I had them retested. My questions for you are: 1. How much do changing hormones and anxiety-produced adrenaline factor in to periodic tachycardia and palpitations? 2. Is there any way I can tell if anxiety is precipitating the palps or if the palps are precipitating the anxiety? 3. Would more testing be in order and if so; which tests would be helpful? 4. Is it better to medicate for the anxiety or the cardiac symptoms? (I have had success in the past with klonopin and had no problems coming off. I have had terrible side effects with SSRI's and also with beta blockers. I am willing to give the beta blockers another chance if that is the best route to go.) Thank you very much.,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,What could be the causes of near bradycardia. Pulse rate is always around 58-62 when at rest ( watching TV at the computor etc). Even standing or slow walking seem to take the pulse to only around 70-75. The reason I ask is that I started to notice palpitations around the same time as the lowered heart rate. I have always had palpitations (PAC's and PVC's) but not in the large volume as now (almost 1000 a day;mostly PACs with few PVCs). For many years before I would only have them occassionaly when tired; stressed etc; now they are at a steady rate. I did start an extensive exercise/diet program ( no fads or drugs; just watching what I eat with lots of cardio) 4 months ago and lost over 30 lbs and was feeling better and stronger than I had in many years. Went to have it checked out and all tests came back within normal limits except for mild hypertension for which atenolol was prescribed in low dose. It seemed that this drug lowered my pulse rate even lower to around 50 and I felt like a slug. I'm 53; otherwise in good health; have stopped almost all exercise for fear that we are missing something of a larger scale but the slow heart rate continues as do the palpitations. Can you shed some light on what could have/is causing all this. I've heard all kinds of answers- stretched the heart because of weight lifting; noise reaching the hearts pacemaker;heart not as flexible due to age; adrenalin excess; etc. It came and stayed out of the blue; granted I now feel and think about it all the time and the anxiety might be a factor but can't be the catch all.

Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for this forum. It has been very informative. I will apologize in advance for the length of this; but I know how hard it is to get on and wanted to make sure you knew my whole story. I am a 38 year old female; overweight by about 30 pounds. In October; 1999; had a situation where I was awakened by my heart racing. It scared me; but I attributed it to too much caffeine that night and finally it subsided. (This was also a time when I began taking birth control after having been off of it for about 1 1/2 years). I had been told prior to that when I tried to give blood that my heart rate was too fast. GP said it was within normal range; 60-100 but suggested I lose weight. I also went off birth control at the end of December. On January 12; 2000; I went to the ER as I was working and felt my heart all of a sudden begin racing. They determined when I first went in that it was at 192bpm. It came down on it's own to 108 in about five minutes; however they still administered a calcium channel blocker to get it down further before releasing me. The Verapamil (120 or 160 mg?) didn't agree with me and my GP took me off of them. I had an EKG and Echo during that time which showed nothing. They were checking for MVP. On March 10; 2000 began racing again at about 140bpm. Went to GP and it went down to 70 bpm in about 20 minutes. He went ahead and sent me to cardiologist for consult; he said that it looked like PSVT; nothing life threatening. Put me on event monitor and gave me Lopressor 50 mg. to take it I had an event and it didn't convert withing 30 minutes or so. He said that I could go to electrophysiologist to look at options; medicine or ablation. I had an event which I was able to record about two weeks ago; event monitor showed 170bpm. I took Lopressor which convered it to 70's range in about 20 minutes. EKG which was taken at hospital during this event showed the following: Vent. rate: 142bpm; PR interval 152ms; QRS duration 88ms; QT/QTc 264/406ms; P-R-T axes 265 97 -45. My questions are (any that you can answer): What is going on with me? Is it dangerous? I would like to not be on medicine if possible. In my situation; is catheter ablation a consideration? Thank you very much for your time.,1999,2000,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Raymond on March 17; 1999 at 22:20:28: In Reply to: Re: Tremors and other odd occurences posted by CCF neuro MD MM on March 10; 1999 at 09:40:32: I hope this post does not appear to long winded. However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of "attack" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor. I feel there is some underlying cause; but they both have said that my episode has nothing to do with the tremor. but why did it become evident only after my other problems. I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor. A less selective drug like Propanolol-(Inderal)would have a chance of helping both problems simultaneously. Hi I visited my Neurologist today 3/16/99 and during our conversation I brought up Propanolol as an alternative to the antenolol. He feeling was that one was as effective as the other in treating E.T.; He also left it up to me to decide if I wanted to switch Beta blockers. As such I have a three fold question for you; 1)What if any is the significant difference between Atenolol and Propanolol in treating E.T.; 2) Are there any definitive tests (ways) to diagnose E.T. (or is it left up to the doctors experience only); and 3) Are there any other illnesses that could possibly present themselves as E.T. Whe I first had my episode the internist tested for pheochromocytoma; but when all test came back negative he decided it was E.T. Thanks for your time and energy. RSA,1995,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run. What's going on? Both my Stress Tests and my echo-stress were negative (I ran on the treadmill for a long time-the doctor said no restrictions) SO why is this happening? Should I have a Thallium Stress test to make sure my arteries are O.K? I also heard there was a high-speed CAT scan that shows plaque in the arteries. I don't think I want to do an Angiogram at this stage. Please help me; I need some good advice. Thanks-I know you guys are busy.,1999,1995,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I'm a 26 year old male; and have had 2 EKG's in the past 3 months. One said I had Sinus Tachycardia; and the other one said Supraventricular. I have to pass a Holter but the waiting list is long ( will get it Oct.14 2008 ) but meanwhile my doctor told me to take Metoprolol because my tachycradia is almost 24/7 (with some exceptions; like at night most often) but runs around 120-170 bpm about all day. This caused me lately to be very exhausted and constantly fatigued; and having trouble excercising. It also generated ALOT of anxiety in me. So; today I took my first dose; I'm prescribed 2 pills a day of 25 mg. I started with halves though because I was scared my heart would drop TOO low; or my blood pressure too low; because I'm not taking this for hypertension. What concerns me; alot I must say; is some things I read about it. Like I do feel light-headed; dizziness and such; but I'm aware that they may be short-term side-effects (or are they?). What startled me tonight was I felt colder (like chills); and my hands felt slightly cold. I read on wikipedia that "It may also reduce blood flow to the hands and feet; causing them to feel numb and cold"... but can this be dangerous? I mean; isn't blood flow important; and also; can it just be temporary? Another thing that alarmed me was here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker#Side_Effects_.2F_Health_Consequences Under Health Consequences; it includes stuff like "Impaired Circulation" and "Heart Failure"; and it does not say "Possible Health Consequences"... so are these things gonna happen without a doubt or are they just mere possibilities? And while I'm at it; are there alot of people who take Metoprolol and have no permanent problems but only beneficial results from this medication? Sorry if I'm bombarding with questions; I just found some sources kind of scary; and also my symptoms which I feared might be long-term so that's why I was wondering if they could wither away. Thanks to any of you willing to answer.,2008,2008,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I am having some bizarre symptoms for about 5 weeks now. My dentist found elevated bp at a routine appointment; which I thought was strange; since I had a complete cardiological workup in January (echocardiogram; holter monitor; 24 hr monitor; ekg; stress/echo test; blood work; carotid doppler) and a ct scan and u/s of the abdomen and pelvis. The only thing showing up on the ct was diverticulosis which i've had for years. I have also had gallstones since 1995 when I was pregnant; and they really never bothered me. Over the past 5 weeks; my bp stayed elevated and was getting worse. I have been petrified of taking bp meds because of side effects. I have multiple drug allergies and an allergy to dyes (I had a tumor in my submandibular gland in 1990 (where I had an anaphylaxis reaction to the cat scan dye) & a melanoma in my fingernail in 1992). I have had anaphylaxis reactions to pencillin and sulfa drugs and some other really bad reactions to other drugs. I didn't do well under general anesthesia when I had my tumor taken out in 1990; so I am petrified of being put out or even having a cocktail of drugs (i.e. propophol & versed for a colonoscopy so I won't have one; if I need to do it; I'll probably do a virtual). Having refused the diovan hct my cardiologist's partner prescribed (I researched it and found out there was sulfa in the hct so I wasn't able to take it); I just kept pressing for more tests when my cardiologist came back; since my gut was that my high blood pressure could be secondary to something else going on. I did go to the ER (before my dr came back) when my bp reached 175/98; and i asked for some basic blood work just to see if there was an infection somewhere in my body; but nothing showed up and they; too; said take diovan. I refused. I had more extensive blood work when my cardiologist came back; and I had elevated aldosterone; but not renin; and high cholesterol (216) and ldl (142). Before the blood work came back; I had a renal doppler sonogram; and it showed there was a blocked artery to my left kidney. I saw the dr who read it; and he was perplexed because my symptoms were atypical for this except for the hypertension (my kidney was not small or shrunken; and the blockage was not typically where one would be). He said he could have made a mistake in reading it (I appreciated his honesty); and he didn't want to do an angiogram (due to my dye allergy) or angioplasty (heaven forbid!) until he knew for sure it was renal artery stenosis; so he ordered an MRI with gadolinium (which although there is not supposed to be a reaction to it - Bayer could not guarantee it - but they did say to make sure there was no kidney disease first - my egfr and creatinine were normal so they said it should be fine). However; my bp is now up to 170-185 at night over a diastolic of anywhere from 98-120). When I get up in the morning it can be as high as 170 as well. It is so frightening. The original med (diovan) was contraindicated for renal hypertension so I was glad I stood my ground and never took it. I do feel there is a missing component to all this. About 4 weeks ago; once I heard about the hypertension issues; I was petrified; and I immediately started to clean up my diet and exercise. I gave up green tea; and coffee (which I rarely drank) and just have been drinking alkaline water. Within 10 days; I lost close to 14 pounds (which I've been dying to do for the past few years but was unable to). I've been doing fresh squeezed veggie juice on occasion; lots of fruit; veggies; nonfat yogurt and minimal protein. I was taking a lot of vitamins; omega 3 fish oils and probiotics and my stools were formed and dark due to the vitamins (I stopped a lot of this in fear that anything I was previously doing might be causing the hypertension). Two weeks into the diet cleanup (up to then my bm's were still okay); while I went to pick my daughter up from camp; I noticed a complete change in my bowels. I was at the hotel; and suddenly I wasn't forming a solid stool. I had only eaten fish; and some broccoli. The small cluster of feces was beige and looked like dog kibble (round little pellets all together in a round ball - you could see the individual pellets). It scared me; and of course my bp was elevated that entire weekend. Since then; I've been eating; still losing weight; have no stomach pain (except for some soreness to the right of my belly button which has been there about 4-5 years) and still no bm. I walk about 45-60 minutes every other day; and I really don't feel bloated or feel like I have an urge to go to the bathroom. My stomach is as flat as its ever been and not swollen or bloated. I began getting worried about not going to the bathroom; and so I took some large doses of vitamin C to try and go; and all that came out was mostly water and very little broken up feces. I urinate frequently (always have). I kept eating; lost more weight; and had 2 little dark strips come out and felt it was an incomplete evacuation. Yesterday; I took some prune juice at night; and more water and broken up black pieces of feces within the water came out (I could also see some pieces of granola in there as I've eaten lots of fiber - allbran; granola; ground flaxseeds and oat bran which didn't produce any bm). I asked the cardiologist and vascular surgeon if there could be any relation between the potential renal artery stenosis and this constipation problem. I told them I hadn't gone in 2 weeks; and they didn't think it was related. Tonight I had 2 little strips come out that were tan; and that really panicked me. I took more prune juice and again all that came out was water and some orange colored broken up minimal feces (I had eaten an omelet this morning with tomatoes and artichokes and chili peppers; cayenne and tumeric which would account for the orange color). That is what scared me; because usually chili peppers cause me to go to the bathroom easily. Should I go to the ER to see if I have an intestinal blockage? Could this all be from the change in diet? Would the best diagnostic test for now be xray or ct scan? I don't have an internist right now; so I would have to find someone to evaluate me asap. I am supposed to have the MRI with gadolinium next Tuesday; August 18th and now I'm scared of doing that in case there is some blockage in my intestines which might interfere with the test. It's so stressful and confusing; and I just feel it all might be related and causing the hypertension. One last thing; I had a fibroadenoma in my breast last January as well; and they used an ultrasound needle biopsy and then inserted a titanium clip in my breast. I mentioned it to my gynecologist as perhaps a possibility for all these problems; but she said titanium is usually very safe. Many thanks; and sorry for the long post.,2008,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi everyone. I just need some reassurance. I am having a lot of PVCs at the moment and it's really starting to worry me no :( I was having about 10 a day but for the past few days i have started having about 100. I am so afraid because they have suddenly increased without any reason. I also had a run of them...about 4 pvcs in a row with no normal beat in between. I was checking out some messages on another heart forum and i read that 4 pvcs in a row can be dangerous. Why am i having so many now??,2006,2007,27,Female

Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39-year-old female who has had episodes of chest pain; abdominal pain; and shortness of breath since 2000. I have a history of seronegative RA and am currently being worked up for dermatomyositis due to myopathic changes in the upper extremities on EMG. I also have been treated for Lyme Disease. I have a complicated history and it is hard for me to know what is "important". My paternal grandfather died of a massive coronary and my maternal grandmother has severe hypertension. Otherwise; I am unsure of any family history of heart disease. I have been seen in the ER many times for chest and abdominal pain and have had several "borderline" and "abnormal" EKG's. In 2000; it was "sinus tachycardia and left atrial enlargement". In 2001; it was "normal sinus rhythm/right atrial enlargement/nonspecific ST abnormality". I had several episodes of chest pain and was given nitro to take which did help. (I was also on Vioxx at this time and had intermittent high blood pressure and after stopping Vioxx in 2004; my symptoms improved quite a lot. ) I was referred for a stress test and a gated perfusion study which was WNL at 54%. I have no details on the findings of the stress test portion. I was referred to cardiology (this was all at a military hospital) and started on Atenolol with a diagnosis of "palpitations and tachycardia". I had a Holter monitor which was interpreted as invalid because one lead was not on right or something. My doctor moved and I was told that follow up was not necessary. I stopped the Atenolol and just went on with life. Later that same year I was treated in the ER for severe abdominal pain after eating. I had pelvic phleboliths and it was assumed that it was a kidney stone. I never passed a stone; but did assume this was correct due to hematuria and a UTI shortly thereafter. I have continued to have intermittent chest pain; sharp transient abdominal pain; and shortness of breath. EKG in 2002 showed "normal sinus rhythm". EKG in 2005 prior to knee surgery showed "arrhythmia/ ST depression/nonspecific ST changes". I was not even aware of this until recently. Dizziness started in December 2006 and continues intermittently. As part of my workup for dermatomyositis; I underwent CT scan of the chest; abdomen; and pelvis. This showed atheroslerosis. My question is could the atherosclerosis cause the symptoms I have been experiencing? I continue with intermittent chest and abdominal pain (always after eating but not all the time) ulcer workups have been negative and I have stopped all anti-inflammatories; shortness of breath; and dizziness. I also notice that when I am angry; stressed; or exercise intensely I become more symptomatic. So what is the proper workup for me at this point? Should I see a cardiologist? Thank you for any advice you can offer.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been taking a beta blocker; 50 mg Metoprolol ER (Extended/Slow Release); for several years but have with my cardiologist approval today refilled my BB prescription with Metoprolol Tartrate (normal release) to be taken at 25 mg twice a day (every 12 hours). My reason is driven mainly by the fact the Tartrate is about 1/6th the cost of the Suc (ER). That said; I wonder if I will not in fact have a more "level" medication concentration taking the 25 mg twice rather than the 50 mg ER once a day. I think there is a good possibility that I'll have a more uniform medication concentration (on average) taking the Tartrate twice a day. Or; I have my doubts about how well a ER holds up over 24 hours. I doubt that I'll have anything to report; i.e.; there will not be any change in my symptoms that I can detect. So this post is more a question/discussion point. It seems I have the same opportunity to save money on my CCB by taking a normal release at half the dose twice a day. I'll discuss this with my cardiologist on my next 6 month regular check up; that assume I'll (hopefully) not have to seem him sooner. :),2008,2011,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I was recently dx with Mild LVH. I have had mildly elevated BP in the past; but now it is under control; usually ranging 112-114/74-78. I currently take Propranolol for the BP and it seems to be working well. My question is; when I went for the test results my Dr. did not seem like the LVH was a big deal and the cardiologist that performed my 2 day stress test did not say that I needed to returm to him for further care. The stress test was neg. for any other problems. Is mild LVH no big deal; could I "keel" over from this? I am thinking that if my Dr. does not seem to cencerned of it; then why should I? I trust my Dr. very much; but after all; it is my ticker we're dealing with here.He just says that I need to keep my BP controlled; and that there are studies that indicate the LVH could regress. Is this correct? Thanks for any input from the board.,2007,2007,37,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,After telling my new Dr. about my family history of heart disease and explaining an incident a few years ago where I had chest pains; I was instructed to have an EKG and an echocardiogram. My EKG was normal and although my echo stated no valvular heart disease it stated I had mild mitral regurgitation and a trace of tricuspid regurgitation. After reseaching on the internet I do better understand what this means. But my main question is this; I am young; 25 years old; and wanting to know if mild matral regurgitation is something that usually gets worse with time or if even in my 50's; or 60's I still have a good chance of it being mild? My father; along with a few others in my family; had a heart arrythmia and atherosclorosis. And my father passed away from cardiac arrest at the age of 52; so I'm sure you can see my concern. I wasn't able to find in my research how often; or what % of people who have mild mitral regurgitation end up with moderate or severe regurgitation. Any insight you can give is greatly appreciated. Thank you.,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 38; 5'2 and now 92 pounds. Very active and healthy until this all started. Coincidentally or not; I was hit on the head hard; by a horses hoof two months ago. (My head is still sore - CAT scan normal) Slowly building from that incident was a fast hr. I would wake up in the middle of the night with it wailing away and all the symptoms I wrote below. I went to the gp and hr was 144. ekg showed lbbb. She sent me home w/25mg topryl. I ended up in the er. The gave me another toperyl and sent my home. All blood work normal except slightly low Potassium in er; 24 urine normal. I am on a fairly high does of beta blockers - 50 mg Atenolol 2x a day. My appetite is not great. I fall asleep OK but awake every night after about 3-4 hours. I can get back to sleep after a little bit. I found a 1/2 glass of wine is not teloreated well. I now find out that my echo showed a part of my heart that should be pumping 50-60% was at 45%. The report says 'LV with mild diffuse hypokinesis; estimated EF 45% and mild TR". The 'event' monitor I was given recorded - Sinus arrhythmia with tachycardia; IVCD; inverted T waves; and baseline movement. My cardio here wasn't concerned and told me to come back in three months. He said it was all 'benign'. Without the beta blockes I cannot function. My heart pounds; my hands get cold and clammy; my armpits sweat like crazy; my heart pounds and I feel TERRIBLE. Does this sound like dysautonomia....stress/benign??? I just don't see how it can be stress if it happens when I am sleeping. Thank you for any replies.,2004,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am depressed & anxiousabout my never ending palpitations. I had an ablation 2+ years ago that zapped one pathway causing 220 tachycardia.since then had non-sustained atria tach at 125; many pvcs; pacs.Last event monitor in March.I had a horrible episode 2 months ago with resting pulse of 140; high BP; PVCS; seen on emergency basis by head of EP dept; said it was panic.That doc; my regular EP doc;my internist all suggested i go on ssri.I am super sensitive to drugs. was on low dose prozac for several years; have been off a long time.Trying to get back on it with liquid;slowly;as did before. on 2.5 mg. a day.PALPS HAVE BEEN WORSE.Wrote head EP doc.he said SSRIs don't cause arrhythmia problems.Regular EP doc says stay on SSRI; no problem.questions: 1.I CAN (*#& READ. Heart arrhythmias are listed as a side effects of prozac in the drug literature. Do cardiologists SEE increased arrhythmia with ssris or NOT? 2.I read prozac has been associated with prolonged QT interval. If i were at risk for this; wouldn't it have shown up on EP test or in EKG years ago when taking 10 mg. of prozac - or not? what IS THE REAL RISK of this? 3.I've had all sorts of palps - skips;thumps;etc. what i'm having now seems to be more pauses.If i take my pulse when happening feels like beat; beat; beat.I can feel an "all out" and sort of flushed feeling. Any explanation for this? again; my internist; ep doc; all say my heart has been checked out THOROUGHLY (I even volunteered for a microvolt alternans test when they were training docs to get that test done;it was "strongly negative".i,2002,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Good Morning and Thanks for taking my questions. I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the interventricular septum; 14 mm nearly one year ago; 4 years prior to that is was 12 mm; same equipment; same cardio. I worry about HCM; though no family history whatsoever; long livers on both sides; average probably about 88 years; though a few have lived to 98/99.I have a connective tissue disease AS. Is it possible that my CTD could actually be responsible for the mild LVH; rather than mild HTN? I consider my HTN very controlled ; it's probably been averaging around 115/75 the last few years. I've also been diagnosed with costochondritis and FM secondary to my CTD; Could these have any link or be contributing factors for my intermittant palpitations (PVCs & tachycardia)? These are also very controlled with atenolol and losartan. I have an history of life long epsiodes of tachycardia & PVCs and rapid heartrates.I do have anxiety issues which doesn't help. I have a very slight intermittant delta wave is lead ll on my ECG ; barely noticable; normal on computer printout and cardio assessment but I've been told I don't have WPW; any opinions or thoughts? Are intermittent delta waves common without a diagnosis of WPW? My last echo was done in July 2005; I was told by my cardio to have another in 2 years; Do you think with the info provided that this is a reasonable time or I should have one earlier? I'm a bit worried about HCM; but I've been assured by my cardio I don't have that. Thanks for your time and Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers.,2005,2006,41,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 64 year old male. I don't smoke or drink. And eat a healthy diet. Weight is 188 lbs. All heart numbers ( cholesterol; etc. ) are better than average. I do have a L-BBB and some Palps; PAC's and ectopic beats. Recently; I had a stress [ tread-mill ] test; ECG; etc. and two nuclear heart scans. [ One under stress and one not. ] I did better than average on the tread-mill stress test. My pulse was 146. My BP remained a decent number as well. However; the nuclear heart scans showed some degree of Dilated Cardiomyopathy. My Ejection Fraction number is 42%. I am scheduled to have a 2-D Echocardiogram next week. If the Echo comes out reasonably okay; do I have too much to worry about? I have been cleared to have daily mild to moderate exercise. I take 75 mgs of Atenolol daily and have been for several years. My BP is usually 120/72. I have a low pulse rate. I suspect they may put my on an ACE Inhibitor for the Dilated Cardiomyopathy. At this point; ( I don't think they know what has caused my Dilated Cardiomyopathy. ) Thanks for this site and your help.,2000,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been taking Xanax and/or Klonopin off and on since November 2005. I am physically addicted to the stuff and wish to get off of all benzos; period. Problem is; I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS); a type of autonomic nervous system dysfunction that causes my body to produce too much adrenalin; which makes my anxiety worse. The benzos helped both my anxiety and my POTS in the beginning; but now they do nothing; the only reason I take them is to keep myself from withdrawing. I keep on needing to go higher and higher in order to get the desired effect; and I am now on Xanax 2mg per day. I don't take Klonopin anymore because it doesn't help my anxiety like the Xanax; and it made my heart race (up to 108 bpm) on several occasions. I have to get off of the Xanax now; but its half-life is so short that it's virtually impossible. Trying to lower the dosage aggravates my condition; causing my heart to beat even faster and making my PVC's worse. What should I do in order to get off of this stuff? P.S. I also take Atenolol 50mg (a beta blocker) and Lexapro 5mg (an SSRI) which really help to keep my condition under control. God Bless!,2008,2008,21,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Twice in the past month I had to go to my local Urgent Care clinic for sudden cardiac symptoms. I think I received inappropriate triage and I and considering sending a letter to the medical director of the clinic. I would like the opinion of someone in the medical field to review my concerns and help me determine if my perception is valid. My only intent on sending the letter is to inform the director and that hopefully the staff will receive some training. On the first occasion; I experienced a sudden tachycardia with exertion that was not relieved by rest. My heart rate was 150. When I checked in and told the receptionist my symptoms; I was not questioned further about other symptoms other than "are you light-headed;" which I was earlier but had improved on the ride to the clinic. That was the only question I was asked. I was told to have a seat and wait my turn. It turns out that I was having a sudden hypertensive episode (196/126). I have no other history of hypertension. I had a normal EKG and some lab work; and my BP was down to about 150/95 when I went home. I saw my own doc 2 days later and was prescribed an event monitor for 30 days. 3 weeks later (and with normal blood pressure during these 3 weeks) I experienced an afternoon of very frequent palpitations; and a sudden increase of blood pressure at home of 190/110 (in the interim I bought a BP cuff for use at home). I went back to the same Urgent Care; told the receptionist I was wearing a heart monitor; that I had increased palpitations; and that my blood pressure was suddenly increased to 190/110. I was not questioned further and was told to have a seat and wait my turn. I saw my own doc the next day. I am now on atenolol and awaiting lab results on a 24 hr. urine for metanephrines. So; again; my question is; am I correct in my perception of having received inappropriate triage; and should I write my letter to the medical director? I thank you for your input.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was discharged this afternoon from a local large hospital's cardiac care unit. There was some disagreement between a couple of doctors as to the significance of these rhythms. I understand that a PVC by itself is nothing; and even a short term Bigeminal or Triplet series is nothing to write home about. However; I was admitted 2 days ago; after a multi-hour stay in another small hospital's ER while they monitored a very long non-stop series of these beats. I was eventually transferred to an unfamiliar hospital's care. During the hour-long ambulance ride; these same arrythmias continuously occurred... sufficient to raise the eyebrows of the EMTs and the receiving hospital's ER team on my way to the ccu. I should add here that I have a history of hypertension; high cholesterol; and a typical rhythm of sinus bradycardia. I am trim; in my 40s; male; and have a family history of heart disease and hyperlipidemia (among other things...). I am currently on Toprol XL; but I don't know if that is best for this situation. I have been researching this issue and there seems to be a lot of contradictory information. The doctors themselves seemed to diagree with one another. One cardiologist said that these rhythms in my case are significant; and another from the same group said that they were not significant; that the heart is healthy and forget I was even told these results in multiple facilities by different professionals. The doctor who seemed to think that the condition should be treated was talking about medication and if that does not work then possibly an ICD. The other doctor wouldn't even talk about the rhythms saying that they were normal. I was given nitro after a stress-test today; and this seemed to control the beats for about 3 hours. Then they slowly started again. Now; I am not ignorant about my health and my heart. I know what is normal; and this was definitely NOT normal. I would not have bothered going to an ER over one or two PVCs. This was hour-long+ periods accompanied by shortness of breath and some pressure and mild pain. Unfortunately; the physician who ordered my transfer to his hospital is the one who doesn't think there is a problem (he viewed the ER ecg and other tests before he authorized the transfer). He was also the one who discharged me three hours ago. I spent 2 days in hospitals only to walk away with a very big question. What should I do next? I am not interested in playing doctor against doctor. All I want to know is which one was more likely to be right so I can pursue that course of action. Some information on the net supports both opinions! It is hard to decide what to do. If I do choose to ignore this problem; are there any warning signs that I should look for with these multiple pvcs that should not be ignored? My usual warning signs are already there... chest discomfort; shortness of breath; palps; etc. If I do not ignore the problem and seek treatment; is it likely that the medication and/or ICD can shorten my life-expectancy as some doctors (on the net) claim. Now; only after 3 hours following discharge; I have spent two hours of them same arrythmias and some tachycardia. Not only do they not seem normal; they are annoying! Thanks in advance for your advice.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; my name is Nicole. On friday 12/05 ; when I was at work I became slightly lightheaded and my heart was beating higher then normal. This experience precipitated what I believe to be a panic attack. My heart was racing; flushed; sweating; waves of terror; etc. However this feeling of a racing heart did not go away and the next afternoon I had my boyfriend take me to the ER because I still felt like my heart was pounding. On the EKG they gave me my HR was 117 BPM; the PR interval was 179 ms; the QRS duration was 71 ms and the QT was 308 ms and the QTc was 430 ms. I am wondering if all of these numbers are normal. The doctors were specifically looking for Wolff-Parkinson's-White because my father had this; so I am wondering if they overlooked anything. I definitely do not have WPW; as this is the third time I've been checked since I was a child. They said I was dehydrated. After this trip the feeling of a racing heart continued and on wednesday night I ended up in the ER again because of tetany ( apparently hyperventilation-induced) while I was driving. I don't mean to sound like a hypochondriac; but it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. SO after all of this the feeling of the racing heart has gone down to somewhat normal. I am just wondering if all these things could be produced by anxiety; and if my ekg numbers are normal; especially the QT and Qtc numbers. My general practitioner gave me a prescription for Inderal LA 60 mg and xanax; but before I start taking them regularly I would just like a second opinion.,2008,2008,20,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,This is; regarding the case of my father in law who is suffering from liposarcoma . A brief case summary; is given below:- My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram; kerla ;India followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumor in his left thigh which was also reamoved next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Only 90% of it could be removed as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.) The pathology report for the thigh tumor and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type ?). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumor is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumor is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumors related to the liposaroma; we took him to Bangalore Instt of Oncology to examine whether Cyber Knife treatment could be of any use. As suggested by them a PET SCAN and DOTATATE test was conducted and the report obtained states that neither CK nor dotattate is possible in his case. I would really appreciate your expert opinion on what further line of treatment is best suited for him which will prolong his life without compromising the quality of life much. 1. Is surgery an option in the given situation ? (followed by Cyber Knife/ chemo) 2.Whether normal radiation method will give him some relief? 3. Are there any other better options we can adopt ? . I await your reply so that we can take further action . Hoping to hear from you soon. This discussion is related to Enlarged Lymph Nodes in Neck.,2009,2009,57,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Re: Re: Loss of upper field of vision [Search][ Follow Ups ] [ Post Followup ] [ Neurology and Neurosurgery Forum ] [ Archive/FAQ ] Posted by CCF Neurology MD - AY on September 10; 1998 at 19:33:26: In Reply to: Re: Loss of upper field of vision posted by Diana Green D.O.B. 25 March 1953 on September 10; 1998 at 08:35:57: : Thank you for your most useful comments . Here is a little more information from my physician. Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further. Any interesting research in this area? Many thanks again. Diana. ====================================================================== Thanks for your additional information. It is quite clear from your posting that there was a lesion to the visual cortex; which is situated in the posterior aspect of the brain. As a "rule of thumb"; most neurological impairments that have not recovered at six months after the lesion onset will not present much significant improvement afterwards. Having said that; however; a great deal can be accomplished with Occupational Therapy techniques that teach patients to compensate for the existant deficits. Regarding your elegibility for driving; it is very much dependent on each state law; hence it is a question better posed to your neurologist or family physician. I hope this information is helpful. This information is provided for general medical education purposes only. Please consult your doctor regarding diagnostic and treatment options.,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By ruth on December 22; 1998 at 18:35:11: I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have "conventional" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was "ischemic." I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore. I feel so stupid.,1998,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello and thank you for reading my post in advance. I have been having a multitude of issues since I was young and it wasn't until lately that I've begun to suspect they may be more related than I thought. I am a 24 year old female who has had hypertension since I was a toddler. As soon as I was old enough; they put me on a alpha-blocker. Later; a beta-blocker was added but alpha blocker was stopped. I am still on atenolol 50 mg daily for this. I have heart palpitations regularly. Around June; I was not stressing and had no caffeinated beverages and while sitting in the middle of my college class I realized I was not breathing well. I then started to get shaky and assumed that I had to eat something as I have often had symptoms of low blood sugar throughout my life and I had not eaten much. When the room started to spin; I grabbed the granola bar in my backpack and went to the bathroom to eat it. By this point; I was feeling the racing and pounding of my heart and nausea was setting in. This was not the first heart episode I had like this. I had one at work before that traveled up my neck and into my head that coworkers could feel just by touching me and another where it seemed like a heart attack. I did not go to the hospital for the first two because I didn't have insurance at the time. This recent time I did because I now do through my college. They saw me at the college clinic right away but by the time I had enough gumption to walk over there I was just very weak and sick feeling. I went to the ER twice that weekend for similar symptoms in which one episode I collapsed and shook violently from cold. The ER made me WAIT hours to be seen in a waiting room with no supervision with this. I fell asleep in the room waiting for the doc and by the time he got there; well I wasn't having the episode. Now; you might be thinking; why isn't this in the cardiology forum? Well I also have had issues with menstruation my entire life. I am married and have been for five years without conceiving with no birth control. Doctors just told me I had PCOS without any testing. They put me on birth controls which drove my blood pressure up. I gave up until after this recent heart episode because that SAME weekend I started what is an ongoing menstruation that only paused yesterday. The OBGYN I saw recently just confirmed for me that I do not have PCOS and no growths in my reproductive tract. When my period restarted today; I had more episodes with my heart. I did see a cardiologist who ran some tests. He said my heart had an extra beat but one is not enough to worry about. He tried a stress test which failed because the drug did not raise my blood pressure enough. I have observed on my own that when I have these episodes; my blood pressure will rise to about 179/140 and drop very quickly. I did some research of my own and I've been reading about pituitary tumors. Some of the symptoms that I have had for years and did not connect seem like they could be related. I have had milky nipple discharge that doctors never seem worried about. I do have headaches behind one eye and have seen halos and what I can only describe as a center point in my vision that light seems to flow towards like ripples. I've never heard or found anything about the odd visual disturbances. I also have arthritic fingers and joints that a doctor told me at 16 I had a marker for rheumatoid arthritis for when I get older and sent me to some useless therapy. (I just live with it for now) and recently I have learned I have sleep apnea. (Been on treatment for about a month with no change to any symptoms) Blood sugar is perfect; btw. I feel that I am WAY too young to be having these problems and it's making me very depressed. I'm desperate to find an answer but doctors just want to treat symptoms. Does it sound like I have a pituitary tumor and if so; what kind of doctor do I need a referral to. (I need a referral for EVERY doctor I see that isn't at my school clinic) Would an endocrinologist be the one? I can't help but feel that at least the menstrual and cardiac problems might be linked. This is ruining my life! Please help!,2010,2011,24,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,So today I went to a doctor (not a cardiologist) and showed my Holter results and he said I should take propanolol 10mg for a few months. According to him; I had 14% of the beats in tachycardia; which is too much. Well I tried to explain that I had a busy day when I used the Holter and I even exercised; and the average HR during the 24 hours exam was 81bpm; which in my opinion is not that big (but I'm not a doctor). The Holter caught only 3 PACs and 5 PVCs; but somedays I have a lot lot more; maybe 300-400. Do you think 14% of the time in tachycardia; even if there's no episode of tachycardia for more than a few minutes; is a reason to start taking beta blockers? Should I listen to a second opinion; from a cardiologist? I don't feel like I need to take it; my HR in the night is usually between 55 - 65 so it will likely drop to 40's.... Thanks for your opinions.,2014,2015,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,My blood pressure; until last year; was always around 90/60; last year it shot up to 234/198 and I had a three hour nose bleed that was stopped with a coagulate med shot when I was rushed to the hospital. From that point on it fluctuated for a month in the 119/90 area ... until I found a good hypertension Doctor who; after dozens of tests; got it under control with norvasc; it still runs around 140/76; so I have just now had the 5 mg increased to 10mg. I have had atrial Fib; ventrical tachicardia and mitral valve prolaspe for 35 years but was not caught until 10 years later; in the past 15 years it has been under control with atenolol and no more episodes for the past 7 years; just a slight amount of arrythmia once in a while. I; also; have just a very slight irregularity in my atrial heart valve. 4 yrs ago I had tremendous water retension and swelling of my leg after a hip replacement and gained 10 lbs over night. They thought I had heart failure but yearly echos have confirmed that I do not; the echos in 2008 showed I had a slight amount of atrial enlargement; Now; the echo I had yesterday shows my right and left atrial chambers are severly enlarged. I have had some angina pain but I think it is mostly from stress; since I had angina pain yesterday after I was told my heart was now severly enlarged. My weight is very normal; I have no shortness of breath; my endurance is quite good; however; I had to give up my walking 5 miles aday after my hip replacement. I have cooked only mediterranian diet food for 20 years. Is it possible that my blood pressure; even though not really high is causing the enlarged heart? Is it alot more dangerous to have an enlarged heart? Does the enlarged heart mean that I now will have more atrial fib; or other heart problems? Is it possible for me to get my heart size back to normal size and if so; how? What other tests can I take that will give me a guide line on the best things I can do for myself to maintain good heart health inspite of a few heart problems. My mother and father both died with heart problems.,2010,2010,80,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I've read through the archives and know that "in general" if there are no underlying conditions that PVCs are benign. I've had them since I was about 13 years old but only once or twice a year. Recentley they started coming (several a day)and some are quite painful;and sometimes I experience what feels like several in a row (10 or so). (I'm 39 now). I frequently experience chest tightness or discomfort before and/or after the PVCs; as well as a host of other symptoms. I had an Echo (15 years ago) which was normal. This year I've had a resting EKG; stress test; wore a Holter monitor and an event monitor. All showed PVCs but the cardiologist said I was fine. Since the "multiple attacks" I've been having a lot of trouble dealing with these. He said he thinks it does more harm than good to treat a benign condition with medications. I tend to agree; but even with a psycologist I can't seem to handle these things. The dang things are causing the stress; which causes more PVCs. I'm afraid to exercise and I have heard that PVCs can degrade into VF. I've asked my cardiologist; but he just tells me to see a pshycologist; so I hope that you all can answer these questions: 1. What factors turn PVCs into VFib and do the tests I have had (Stress test; holter and event - echo (10 to 15 years ago)show if I am at risk for this happening to me? 2. Dr. won't give meds and I don't drink; smoke; eat caffine or chocolate; Tha Chi for stress etc. so are there any "natural" remedies to help ease these things? I'm desperate for relief if only to ease my fear.,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Happy New Year; Last night had a very frightening experience; laying in bed had what I normally felt like a pvc; anyway my heart basically started to feel like it was quivering. I reach to take my pulse for a few seconds i couldn't find one; then despite this irregular quivering of my heartbeat; my pulse was regular at least fairly regular and had good volume. Is it possible it might have been a-fib with a fairly regular pulse or interpolated pvcs occuring without a pause? I know it would be impossible to know for sure without a ecg tracing or holter; only had this particular feeling about 8 years last about the same lenght of time about 5-10 minutes. I was really alarmed; my wife was shopping so I had to call my sister who lives next door over; she said I looked deathly pale ; though she claims she experineces the same feeling quite often. It went away quite quickly; I decided not to go to the ER unless it returned; thankfully so far it has not. I skipped my atenolol and cozaar last night; I have a feeling atenolol might be contributing to these episodes so I have decided to half my atenolol dose and see what happens. I take 100mg daily in divided doses. I suspect it could be the culprit; any thoughts? Medical history . have AS; a connective tissue disease. Heart evaluation echo; stess test and ecg. normal ; besides mild LVH. ECG and echo within the last 6 months ; stress test 4 years ago.mild hypertension (very controlled) Do this sound like it might have been V-tach or AIVR; pulse probably 80-90 bpm the whole time? These episode set me back mentally,2005,2006,41,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run. What's going on? Both my Stress Tests and my echo-stress were negative (I ran on the treadmill for a long time-the doctor said no restrictions) SO why is this happening? Should I have a Thallium Stress test to make sure my arteries are O.K? I also heard there was a high-speed CAT scan that shows plaque in the arteries. I don't think I want to do an Angiogram at this stage. Please help me; I need some good advice. Thanks-I know you guys are busy.,1999,1995,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Hell; I hope you are doing well. I am having a problem where I have episodes of severe pain on my left side of my chest. I am 29 YO male and My Doctor says it is chosto chondritis. He has giving me some Celebrex and Vicadin. Neither work. When I feel this pain; (at night when I am trying to go to sleep) It always worries me and I get anxious. It will not go away until it is time for me to go to work the next day. (so I stay up these nights). It is a constant pain over the left chest area sometimes high in the chest and sometimes low. I have had light headed spells that will last all day. And on 2 occassions my left leg has went numb. On 1 ocassion I went to the Er; CAT a cat sckan and EKG showed nothing. I have had blood work done and nothing. My mom was diagnosed at 29 with Leukemia. I remember her telling us after she would go to the docter; before she was diagnosed; that he said it was not her heart. This always hits at night. Usually late and sometimes wakes me up. Everything is going great; money; family; job. Nothing really to be stressed about except the Cowboys and Stars keep losing. What does this sound like to you. I know you can not diagnose me but any advice/suggestions. The pain is pretty intense and usually lasts about 6 hours.,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I recently began having pvc's several times an hour and was started on atenolol 50 mg after being diagnosed with hypertension also. 150's/90's. Now have very few pvc's and B/P 120's/80's. However an echo for checking cause of pvc's revealed mitral valve prolapse with redundacy of posterior leaflet and a moderate mitral regurgitation; trivial tricuspid and trivial pulmonary valve regurgitation. Have had chest pain at times over past 2 years and episodes of shortness of breath with exertion; but not always. Will be having a stress echo next week. If stress echo is normal; what should I expect for follow-up of regurgitation and what is the probability that it will not get worse? 41 y.o. non-smoker; Thank you so much for any info.,2002,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have been having heart palps on and off for two years. I am a 26 yr old woman and perfectly healthy. About a year ago I had a series of tests(EKG; holter monitor;event monitor;echocardiogram)and have seen both and an M.D. and cardiologist. Tests showed PVC's;PAC's; and atrial runs. None of the Drs seemed too concerned. Through my own research and keeping a time line on a calendar I have assumed that they were related to hormones. I usually get them on and off for about a week(sometimes pretty big ones-several times a day) and then nothing for anywhere from 3 wks to 8 mos but they always end up coming back eventually! I have gotten off birth control;do not drink ANY caffine; am not overweight; and am not stressed(except when I have them).After I got off the pill I did not have any for about 8 mos and then last month they started up again w/my period and then left at the end of my cycle(however; they are not always during my perod). I don't want anything to be wrong but I am tired of being worried about this. Do you have any advice about this? Have you heard of heart palps being related to hormones is women? Should I see a electrophysiologist? Please help!,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is "1". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.,2009,2010,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question. I am a bit confused as to what most cardiologist consider a normal ejection fraction; I have seen conflicting numbers though the difference being very small. I have seen 50-70% as normal ; then 55-75% as normal. What numbers or % do CCF use? Would you consider an EF of 50% and over normal? The reason I ask my last echo 2 months ago on the printout it showed an Ef of 53%; yet in the doctors office he said my EF was actually 55-60%; when I received a copy of the echo report it said 53%; I called and asked him about the difference in the printout and what he told me; he said my Ef was what he told me 55-60% and the number on the printout was of no significance; that I had no signs of cardiomyopathy. Even if my Ef 53% ; would you still consider that normal? From what i gather most centers and cardiologist consider 50% and above normal; though I seen guidelines with the low being 55%; this is confusing;I just some clarification. My EF 5 years was 65-70%; I understand it can vary; he told me that time I was more nervous and that my heart was a bit hyperkinetic then; Would you agree that increased anxiety with your heart punding harder ; even if no that much faster can increase your EF? I was told 5 years ago I had borderline hypertrophy at 12mm interventricular septum; now the printout shows 14mm; he told me my hypertrophy was mild; this was the only thing that was out of range on my echo; all other measurements was normal. I do push ups regularly to keep my back straight because of a CTD I have; Would this cause mild LVH? Thanx,2005,2005,40,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I have posted before in this forum and also want to thank the doctors and other people who are so informative and supportive. My question is this. I don't drink alcohol often but when I do I tend to drink to much. Friday within a period of the evening from 7:00 P.M. to 3:00 P.M. I consumed 3 bottles of white wine. Of course I did not feel well the next day. But; Sunday and Monday I felt pain with nausea all day. I was wondering if maybe the dehydration had something to do with increasing PVC's and nausea. I have also had nausea alot when I haven't drank alcohol too. I just had a 30 day event monitor and it had runs of trigeminy; alot of PVC's and sinus tachycardia. I had alot on holter 18;000 in 24 hours. They are getting much more painful now and the doctor also has be on .05 xanax for night. I have also been experiencing alot of joint pain in back and knees. Could the drugs be causing this. I think I have asked this before but I don't think I got an answer. When you have this many episodes does it cause you to be tired and lethargic or would that be side effects from meds. I am also on hyzarr(50 ml) a day for blood pressure. I am a 45 year old white female with full hysterectomy fours years ago. I am not on any hormone replacement. But; I have had every test known to man for my heart and seems like everything is fine. I am about 30 lbs overweight though. When wearing 30 day event it would jump from 85; 145; 240 and back to 71. Is this from PVC's??? I know this is alot to comment but I would really appreciate your imput. Maybe another EP study?,2003,2003,44,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm on Inderal 20mg 3xday. It seems to lower my bp a little too low; does anyone know a beta blocker that can help with SVT and tachycardia but not on the blood pressure as much? Thanks; Michelle,2004,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,6 weeks ago I went to the ER with Chest Discomfort; BP Was high (240/120). Labs; X-Ray; EKG normal. Background 35 yr old male. Borderline hypertension most of the time.; LDL 150; total 230. Non-smoker. About 20 lbs overweight; exercise regularly. I'm still getting chest pains; mainly shooting in nature; bi-lateral; but occasionally dead center and it's pressure. 1. They did a nuclear stress echo with exercise; said everything looked normal. EF 60%. How often do false negatives show up? 2. I'm belching constantly. Many times it relieves the dead center chest pain. However the upper chest shooting pains come and go. Should this belching help ease my mind this is not caridac? 3. Lately I "feel" like my heart is fluttering sometimes. I've gotten lightheaded a few times; however I do acknowledge that the ER trip and these pains have my anxiety through the roof. My internist wants me to get an upper GI scope; mentioned this could be my esophogus. I've been on prilosec for 6 weeks with little change though; might even be worse. Is the upper GI scope the next logical step? 4. Should I push for a cardiology consult? My understanding is that angina or MI pains are not shooting in nature(most of mine are under 5 seconds) with the exception of a few times I had this center chest pain. I've already had an exercise stress with nuclear done that was clean. The next steps would be an echo; or cath correct? Would any cardiologist realisically do either with my symptoms? 5. I'm now on low does of altace; norvasc; and crestor. Is this logical?,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed 10 years ago with mitral valve prolapse. I awoke one night shortly after the birth of my third child with symptoms suggestive of a heart attack. I went to the ER and was told everything was okay. I consulted with a cardiologist and was told I had MVP. I was put on medication. The history after that with this problem was that I was on and off medication due to side effects. I would have symptoms of rapid heart beating and put on medication for that. I saw manycardiologists and doctors over the years. Some would say on the basis of listening that I definitely DID NOT have MVP. Some would say I did. I continued to take SBE prophylaxis over that entire time as a safeguard. Recently I have been having more symptoms and they have worsened. I have gained weight and also have developed high blood pressure. I had one episode that I had to call the EMTs for and they said that it registered on the rhythm strips that I was having SVT. At the hospital it only registered as sinus tachycardia but it rain in the 130-150s for about 2 hours then down to 110-120s for the next two and finally leveling off in the low 100s. I went to another cardiologist after this and was just told today (by a nurse) that the echocardiogram shows no MVP but shows mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. In the last few months I have had lots of tests including EKGs; 24-hour Holter; Thallium scan; and now this echocardiogram. I had one cardiologist about three months ago do the thallium; 24-hour monitor; and EKG and said i didnt need an ECHO. He said from listening that i DEFINITELY HAD MVP and that I needed to take SBE prophylaxis! After this episode with the SVT I decided to get a second opinion altogether and upon physical exam by the new cardiologist he says I DEFINITELY DONT have MVP but he performed this ECHO and the reading says now I have mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. This doctor put me on Verapamil to help with the blood pressure and the arrhythmia and tachycardia problems. My question to you is WHY all the discrepancies. What am I to believe? How serious is this? I understand that it can be progressive and can need repair? I would just like some general information so that I will know what kind of questions to ask him when I go in for my follow-up appt. in about a week. I am very perplexed and concerned that anyone really knows what is going on with me. I have a VERY STRONG family history for heart disease of all sorts including in m y father alone stroke;CAD;CHF; Pacemaker! so I really would like to try to avoid these problems if possible. Thank you for your help. Beverly,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Dr. Lately it seems that my heart rate is taking longer to return to resting after exercise than usual. For the last several weeks; I exercise at 140-150 bpm for 45-50 minutes; and after 15 minutes cool down; my heart rate is still in 120-130 range. It used to come down to 110 or so after that time. I'll admit that I tend to panic if my heart rate is in any way suspect; but I think I am seeing a difference in the last few weeks. I take a diuretic for high BP; and I wonder if I may be dehydrated; but there has no change in BP medication in last several weeks. Also; 3 months ago my doctor increased my thyroid medication; so this may be a factor. Other than post-exercise; my pulse is behaving nicely. I had an echo 2 years ago that was "normal". Please advise.,2002,2003,,

However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of "attack" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor. I feel there is some underlying cause; but they both have said that my episode has nothing to do with the tremor. but why did it become evident only after my other problems. I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor. A less selective drug like Propanolol-(Inderal)would have a chance of helping both problems simultaneously.,1999,1995,,

Atenolol+hypertension,I have periods of persistent atrial fibrillation. The first was in 2010 and was successfully cardioversed precisely after six months. The second period was in spring 2012 and was cardioversed after six weeks' warfarin treatment. The present period is going on now (from 6. January) and will be cardioversed after 7 weeks from the beginning. An electric cardioversion immediately after the onset of AF is possible only when one is 100% sure that it has not lasted more than 48 h. Otherwise one must be on Warfarin (Marevan) so that INR is on the therapeutic level at least for three weeks. At all times of my AF; I have had INR on the therapeutic level (2-3) soon and mainteined it there for all the AF time (and a few extra months). At the meantime I have used "children's aspirin). Is it good to keep people with AF for too long times? Why do doctors not study causes of AF? I myself have suggested eg. dehydration; infections and hyperparathyroidism for causes of AF. I have not had thorough heart studies and discussions in a hospital. I have organized them at sevearal private doctors' offices. When people go to electric cardioversion to the hospital; it is performed in a steady stream with only short discussion with the doctor. ECG has been done several times. I have a small leakage of mitral valve. During the second period of AF the leakage was possibly slightly larger than during the first AF. With AF; my pulmonary pressure rises and left atrium enlarges. ProBNP rises at least to over 2400. Doctors did not begin to measure it; I ordered the measurement myself. But the rise does not matter. I have respiratory difficulties. After the six-month AF in 2010 the left atrium; however; shrank to normal (in 2011). Enlargement of the left atrium is thus not a cause of my AF but a consequence. Is it good to keep me with AF? My blood pressure and pulse have always been very variable. I am now 65 years. In the nineteen eighties I often had paroxysmal tachycardia. Atenolol was begun and I am still using it. Possibly I got CFS (ME) in the eighties. At the change of 2009-2010 I had some infections; and before the AF period in 2010 I ordered a test for autonomic nervous system. In 1/3-maximal grip (maximal was 30.4) test my blood pressure was 259/140 (at rest before the test 153/80). The increase was: systolic 106 mmHg and diastolic 57. In Valsalva test pulse reaction was weak. In deep breathing test respiratory arhythmia was weaker than normal. In orthostatic test blood pressure reactions were strong: at 30 sec systolic +47 and at 3 min systolic +87. Atenolol 50 mg and Thyroid 2;5 G were in use. As a conclusion of the autonomous nersvous systen test it was said that; the result did not clearly deviate from normal. The weak pulse reaction can result from already high pulse at the beginning. Maybe sympaticotonia causes the greater blood pressure increase and the higher pulse. My blood pressure and pulse are very variable during the AF; and also without AF. During AF my diastolic pressure is sometimes increased. Sometimes; when sitting; my blood pressure varies between 98/71 and 141/109. In an ambulatory (24 h) blood pressure test (without atenolol) in 2006; my systolic pressure varied between 98 and 228 (mean 141). Diastolic pressure varied varied between 44-113 (mean 84). The pulse varied between 64 and 137 (mean 91). I was ashtonished; because my pulse pressure minimum and maximum were 14 and 134!! Why? I have chronic sinusitis. At the change of 2012-2013 I have had dyspnea and respiratory infection and norovirus. I have some inconsistency in my iron status. I have not iron deficiency but have small and pale red cells. Maybe I have slight secondary anemia due to infections. I have too low IgG3 and complement lectin pathway. I have nodules in my lungs. They have not increased in size during two years. I am on thyroid medication (Thyroid Erfa). Partial diabetes insipidus could not be excluded in a water deprivation test. I have Sjoegren's syndrome and cervical dystonia. The latest diagnosis is too thick endometrium. I am using 25 mcg estrogen and every second month progesterone (Terolut). When I on January 6 2013 was in the Emergency unit; my red cell count was 5.52; hemoglobin 153 and hematocrit 0.45. Na+ was 146 (137-144 normal!); fP-gluc 6;6 (!; no diabetes). I think that I was dehydrated. My dehydration may be due to partial diabetes insipidus; hyperparathyroidism; or vitamin D. Vitamin D intake was increased early in autumn 2012 from 25 mcg to 50 mcg. Then I had; according to a doctor; to increase D-vitamin intake to 100. At the end of 2012 I had increased it to 75 mcg; and then I was one day at 100 mcg. I did not feel good and dropped it back to 75 mcg on the next day. Then early in the morning of the next day (Jan 6) I found atrial fibrillation. I dropped the vitamin to 50 mcg. Then I once tried to take 75 again and got polyuria and thirst; and dropped it back to 50 mc. It can be suggested that the vit D increase was a cause for the onset of AF. ???,2011,2013,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 27 year old female; 6'1; and 310 lbs. Yes; I am fat- but please don't focus in on that. For the last three weeks I have been having daily "spells." I become very discombobulated; my vision blurs; eyes loose focus; feel disconnected from my body. Most times; I am able to get to the floor of my own accord and wait out the feelings. Twice they hit so suddenly; I crumpled loosing conciousness for a fraction of a second (standing to prone is blank). For a few of these episodes there were nursing staff quickly on hand that checked my BP and pulse (bottom number on BP elevated; pulse pretty normal). I have been to ER; urgent care; and my PCP; the only thing they have been able to tell me is that I'm having episodes of near syncope. The EKGs have all been good; blood work- fine; urinalisis- good; thyroide-operational; and event monitor shows normal readings. Spell symptoms include: light head; sinus pressure; head aches; tingling hands and feet; chest pain (both sides; not just heart area); numbness across shoulders and down arms; brown outs; eye strain/pain; heavy head; tingling scalp; feel like moving through sludge; extreme exhaustion; loss of motor control; thick tongue feeling; difficult to speak and understand; and occasionally bright/dark/wiggle spots in vision. Post spells I am usually completely exhausted (can sleep for hours); disoriented; loss of concentration; blurred vision; pin and needles- all of these can go on for hours. I have spent the last three days in a constant state of dreaminess; like my mind and body are moving independently; have had several minor spells; and what worries me- my finger nails have started turning blue. Both my hand and my feet will become cold as ice within seconds of being immobile- the nails have started to turn a deep indigo blue shade as well. I've read many other posts about people having some of these symptoms; but I can't seem to see any solutions. Additionally; I have a few other worries to throw in. I "had" blood clots in Sep '07; superficial- documented with ultrasound. The clots were still there; in the exact same place; when they were looked at again (ultrasound) in Nov '08. When I had my first spell; three weeks ago; the urgent care did a blood test and said that the clots were gone now. The pain; fatigue; and throbbing in my leg was just because of the vericose veins- said the Dr. It's not the same kind of pain as the veins have given me before. I have polycystic kidney disease; hypertension (treated with atenolol; 25mg-4yrs); and chronic sinusitis. I've tried to get the doctor to consider looking at my sinuses; CTing my kidneys (due to increased abnormal pain); or changing my atenolol. They all just keep going in circles about my heart because of the chest pains. I'm incredibly frustrated as I have been taken off the work schedule until released by my PCP and she is doing nothing to help my figure all this out. My depression is getting worse; I'm starting to worry myself- which is causing more anxiety- which isn't helping my current condition. I have spoken to multiple DRs and nurses about the atenolol side effects I had experienced and they all tell me that they've "never heard of anyone having that reaction before." As the abnormal weight gain (about 60lbs in 1 1/2yrs); sluggishness; moodiness; and depression are all on the list of side effect to speak to your DR about on the med description- I'm confused. I realize that this is probably a needlessly long and rambling post; chock full of irrelevant information- but; please; don't let that deter anyone from giving whatever advice or useful thoughts you may have. I really need help with this; I'm reaching the end of my rope trying to get someone to listen and help me.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; just need to ask if anyones knows the best way to reduce a daily dose of 80mg of Propranalol? I take 40mg in the morning and 40mg before bed; but i am beginning to think that this drug; after 6 months of taking it; is starting to play havoc with my circulation. I am constantly feeling dizzy; breathless when try to stand up or move about; simple things cause me to feel unsteady and i often feel like im gona pass out and then have a panic attack. I want to see if it is indeed the Propranalol that is causing it. I want to reduce to 20mg x 2 daily and see if this helps with the symptoms but dont want to do it too quickly causing more side effects. Thanks,2009,2010,36,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Whats up guys!! I'm 6 weeks into Tx now.. I'm still feeling pretty good.. No exteme Sx so far... I'm in the Telaprevir trial and i go to the study nurse almost every week to get the blood test and to get a quick physical.. well every time i go my blood pressure is threw the roof... 148/102 I went to my regular doc and she gave me a script for blood pressure meds... Do you think the Hep C Meds are causeing my high blood pressure??? i'm already taking 12 pills aday for the hep c; now i gotta take more pills.. Great I know high blood pressure is a serious thing and i wanna know if i can get away with out taking the pressure meds?? Is there a different way to fix my blood pressure without taking the meds??? or should i shut up and just take the pills?? lol I did have little problems before tx with blood pressure but it turn out that i was just extremely **** off about having Hep c... so when i relaxed alittle my blood pressure would go to normal...

Atenolol+hypertension,I've been experiencing periodic spells of tachycardia off and on for about 6 months now. Was hospitalized overnight once; and all bloodwork; X-Rays; echocardiogram and so forth came back fine. I've been going to see an EP for 3 months now; have worn the event monitor; and all they came up with was sinus tach. My EP hasn't come up with a specific diagnosis; but suspects either Inappropriate Sinus Tach or an Atrial Tach that they haven't caught yet. The highest my pulse has gotten during any attacks has been about 140. At rest it can get as high as 95; up to 115 or so when standing. Exercise or eating doesn't seem to trigger any attacks. I don't have attacks everyday; and since I've been taking betablockers; I rarely ever have them. Resting blood pressure is good; standing as high as 140/100. I've tried 3 different types of betablockers; all low doses; and they all make me feel ill (exhausted; headaches; nightmares and insomnia). No PACs or PVCs that I'm aware of. Oh yes; I'm a 33 year old male; and have been in good shape for the past 18 years. Questions: 1. My EP says these problems may just go away on their own? Is this possible? 2. I'm scared to death of problems with impotence from the betablockers. Should I be concerned? 3. Do calcium channel blockers produce less side effects then betas? 4. Should I even be taking meds for these symptoms; or just deal with it? 5. Has anyone tried supplementing with magnesium or Hawthorn to control arrhythmias? 6. I've read that viral infections may cause arrhythmias. What type of doctor would I see to test for this?,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Good Morning! I have some questions regaurding my health. Approx 2 1/2 years ago I began to have upper left shoulder pain. An upper GI showed nothing along with a stress echo which did show mild LV enlargement. Acouple of months after these tests the pain moved in mid of sternum;following lightheadiness;and nasua. I had a nuclear stress test which was also negative. In Jan of 2004 I had a heart cath that showed nothing. I have worn a holter monitor that showed pacs and pvc with 1 bout of SVT. My question is that with little excertion my heart pounds and I still have chest pains.I do smoke and blood pressure is usualy around 135/85.I also have thoracic subluxations of the spine. Does this sound like heart related with all tests or something else. Just another question is when I smoke my chest hurts behind the sternum. Sorry for being long winded but any suggestions would be kindly appreciated,2004,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,How prevalent is it for some paitents to be prescribed Flecainide for PVC's by their doctors / cardiologists and told to go home and take their first dose and I'll see you this time next year; as I was told; instead; of having the patient admitted for hospital or clinical observation / testing in order to see how their body responds to it first? In my case; I declined the Flecainide for various reasons. Bon-Bon,2007,2009,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,A healthy and happy New Year to you Cardio Docs! I have pain in my chest; jaw and arm. I am been worked up twice with a stress echo; twice in one year. I wore a holter during these episodes and it came back fine. I am on Atenolol. I have a few questions though. 1. Will Atenolol weaken my heart over time ? (years) 25 mg. I take it for pvc's. 2. Is the stress echo accurate in woman? I am 34 and otherwise healthy? I have had one regular stress test; an echocardiogram; and two stress echo's. (all within one year) 3. Can panic or anxiety really cause these same symptoms? ( chest/arm pain too?) Every time I go to the Er with these symptoms; my Ekg and enzymes are fine...Any clues? My cardio says its NOT my heart; but it sure feels like it when the pain in my chest hurts. Thanks and blessings. :),1999,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,So some of you know that I'm a pain management patient and I took a "drug holiday" earlier this month (stopped my meds for 2 weeks in order to restart my tolerance)...I wasn't sure if I was going to refill my script or not; but I did. I don't have a problem abusing my medicine (I take 5mg Norco 3x a day) but I'm tired of having to take them around the clock or end up with withdrawals. So...I'm done. I'm in the middle of my script and when I woke up this morning I got the awful withdrawal-haven't-taken-a-pill-in-a-long-time feeling and I decided that I'm done. I made an appointment with my GP tomorrow and I need to know what to ask her..I'm going to ask for some medicine to help me deal with the withdrawals. I'm stopping cold turkey this weekend. We're moving into a new house and we're goin to be painting and putting down carpet and moving...but this is the best time for me to do it. I need to keep busy or I will start having panic attacks - I take the medicine for legitimate pain reasons and the thought of dealing with the pain without medicine has me panicked even now; so I know that I need to keep busy or I'll cave and start taking the medicine again and I just don't want it anymore. But by the same token I can't completely shut down; and I have 2 small children who rely on me (my husband will be home 4 days this weekend as well; which is why this is a good time for me to do it) so I need to be somewhat functional. what do you guys recommend? I know I"m going to get some multi-vitamins and protein shakes...I was thinking of asking for clonodine and something for anxiety; as well as something for RLS and sleep - when I've cut my meds out before the RLS and the interrupted sleep been the worst part of it for me. does anyone have anything else to recommend? my GP is very helpful and I think she'll give me whatever I feel like I need because I mean it's pretty much every doctor's dream to get their patient off of 24/7 pain meds right? anyway..I'm terrified. I really am. I've lived with pain meds for 5 years because my pain level is so high; and while I've stopped taking them before for weeks or months at a time...this time I'm really done. i want to be done. I know my pain is going to be back; but I don't know that it's not better than dealing with pain medicine 24/7 and all the appointments and side effects that come with it. please help me..I'm so scared. I need to do this NOW before I chicken out and continue the cycle. I already called and canceled my PM appointment for next month where I was supposed to get another refill; and it takes a long time to get an appointment so at this point it's do or die. (not really lol but you know what I mean). help..can I do this?! will the medicine help me?! I know I'm on a low dose; so I should be able to function...right? i know I need to buy immodium too....omg; I'm so scared; but I'm so ready. help...I know I'm not an "addict" but I'm physically dependent and you guys are the only ones I can think of who can help me...so please do. the pain terrifies me; it really does; but i'm done.,2009,2011,25,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 38 yo white male with a family history of heart disease (Dad died of CAD at 42; maternal Grandmother had 1st heart attach at 52). I was diagnosed with CAD in June and had angioplasty & 4 stents (Cordis drug eluding type) for 2 blockages each in my LAD & RCA. I suffered a complication; my artery was perforated during the proceedure and a pericardial effussion started; leading to cardiac tamponade and a near death experience. An emergencey Pericardiocentisis followed along with days in the ICU with a drain in my chest; then several months of steroids to shrink the effussion. Follow up echoes show the effussion to be gome and no damage to my heart. I am now on Lipitor80 & Zetia10; and my ldl is down from 160 to 72. I'm also on Plavix; Enalapril; asprin and Atenolol (25mg x2). I have Gerd to add to all this. I constantly feel chest; gastric pains & palpitaions and these lead to what I believe are panic attacks. I have had 2 thallium stress tests at 2 different facilities in the last 6 weeks; both of which were negetive. My cardiologist assures my that I am fine; I do not have a new blockage or restenosis. He believes that I am suffering from anxiety problems; which I am now forced to agree with. I believe that I am sufferuring from a panic disorder (cardiac neurosis?); I take my pulse and check my BP constantly and I panic at every discomfort I feel in my chest. It is becomming a problem for me. Do you come across this sort of thing very often? What treatments or therapies do you recommend for your patients who suffer from similiar problem?,2004,2004,37,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted by V. Talley on August 03; 1999 at 13:09:49 I am a 19 year old female and have just recently started having problems with my blood pressure. I was taked to the emergency room a few days ago- my blood pressure was 175/120 - I was given several medicines and it took several hours for any of them to be effective. The ER Doctor put me on 60mg procardia once a day. I put a call in to my regular physician but she was out of town and one of the other doctors that works with her wanted to see me right away. He was a young doctor and seemed somewhat unsure of himself. He offered no reasons why I might be having this trouble nor did he tell me any ways that this could be regulated- ie diet. He simply changed my medicine to atenolol and had me go for a chest x-ray. The medicine seems to be making me feel drained and like I have no energy and my blood pressure is still high. I thought that after a visit to the doctor I would feel less concerned about this and maybe have some answers- but I don't. Do you have any suggestions as to what could be causing this and should I seek further medical attention? Thank you for any response you may be able to provide. Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - CRC on August 03; 1999 at 13:55:10 It is somewhat unusual for a 19 year old to have high blood pressure but it is possible. I would ask your doctor to look for secondary causes of high blood pressure. It is possible your medication could be making you feel tired. This will also need to be addressed by your physician. Here is some general information about high blood pressure. High blood pressure; or hypertension (HTN) ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. High blood pressure may be primary (essential) or secondary. If the hypertension is secondary there may be a treatable cause. Most of these causes are relatively rare (i.e. renal artery stenosis; pheochromocytoma). If no secondary cause is found then the high blood pressure is said to be primary. The vast majority of cases of HTN are primary. The main cause of primary HTN is genetic. Q: I am hoping to get pregnant in the future and I am wondering if this will effect things? A: Blood pressure may be elevate during pregnancy and if you have a predisposition to high blood pressure it should be closely monitored during pregnancy. Q: I believe the higher blood pressure is directly related to anxiety which may be OK for the "normal" person; however with me having this disorder I deal with anxiety A LOT and I often endure it without my medication. A: It is important to take the medication you need for anxiety. In addition you may need blood pressure medication if your high blood pressure continues. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,am a 14 year old girl and was diagnosed yesterday with left ventricular hypertrophy caused by my hypertension. The cause for my hypertension is unknown. I don't exercise but Im fit and normal weight. I keep a low-slt diet. I am not being treated with atenolol 25 mg twice a day. So my question is that how quickly does the ventricualr hypertrophy usually progress? When I saw my cardiologist iN january i did not have it and in a 6-month period it developed. I also have mitral valve regurgitation and diagnosed with arrhythmias.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 53;don't smoke; never drank;no drugs;no coffee. Had palpitations since 13 years old but rarely. Sometimes on a daily basis and other times with days or weeks of no skips. About two weeks ago the palpitations started coming in a regular manner at about 3-5 per hour pretty much every hour of the day. This of course was frightening and I worried and became more aware of every skip. By the third day the skips were at every minute with a few doubles/triples ( each with only a few regular beats between them. I was in terror so I went to the local ER. They took Xrays;blood work;EKG's a 24hr holter monitor. The ER doc saidthe PACs were frequent with an occassional PVC but they were probably benign. He suggested I see a Cardiologist as my blood pressure was quite high at 180/100. I have always had white coat hypertension and at home with the nurse neighbor taking it was 145/90.The Cardiologist reviewed all the tests including more blood work; echocardiogram; his conclusion was even though I was having lots of skips ; the condition was benign and my blood pressure was more of a concern. He recommended Atenolol 50mg and said it should resolve lessen the palps. Fearing the potential side effects I took half dose first as within 4 hours my bp was at 110/75 with a scary pulse rate of 52-56. My resting rate is usually 62 The pressure and low pulse rate continued all day. I started a advanced excercise diet program about 8 weeks before these palps started and lost 25 lbs. Lots of cardio and weights. The blood work showed slight elevation in magnesium.Scared to death.,2002,2002,,

Atenolol+hypertension,when I was 15 I had been diagnosed with and enlarger aortic root with a diameter of 4 centimeters. the other day for my one year check when I am 16 my root had enlarged .2 centimeters and now is at 4.2 centimeters. I was wondering what is there that could be done. What are some treatments?...what can I do and what cant I do?....and am I going to need surgery?.. .,2010,2010,15,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I've been dealing with the darn PVCs on a daily basis for 8 months now. It seems like they are becoming more frequent. I'm taking potassium and angstrom mg for 2-3 weeks with no improvement. Every time I have an active or stressful day I am punished at night with a string of PVCs that can last for hours. They appear to be adrenaline related. It has made my life miserable. My EP gave me a special script for an EKG for when I got a bad episode; so last night I went to the ER and they hooked me up. They saw PVCs coming every few seconds; and the technician said they all looked identical; so it appears that they are unifocal. I'm not sure what to do here. I don't have PVCs ALL day; but I do get them EVERY day. Some days are manageable; other days are very frustating. I am living right now for the moments when I am PVC free. Not a good way to live your life. So my question to all you fellow sufferers is; is the ablation worth the possible risks? And what are they? Thanks for your responses.,2011,2011,41,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with SVT 3yrs ago; and decided against the ablation; took Toprol xl for a time but currently take no meds for it. It is much better than when I was first diagnosed though I still have attacks. I am taking fertility treatments and told the re about the svt. He agreed to treat me; but I am wondering if any of you with svt had any trouble with your attacks becoming more frequent or severe during pregnancy? I am concerned that if I become pregnant it will suddenly worsen. Also; do any of you with svt experience neck problems during an attack? When my hr approaches 200 during one; my neck tightens up on both sides and I can feel the pulse much more prominently than in my chest. It actually feels as if something could burst but I know it wouldn't really happen. I've asked my dr if I might have anxiety as well but he says I do not. I'd appreciate any advice or comments; thanks so much! em,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,10 years ago I was Dx w/hiatal hernia. In Oct had an endoscopy and diagnosed w/extreme gastrits and given Rx of 30mg Prevacid daily. In first week of Feb began to experience extreme discomfort and pressure at the xiphoid process of the sternum and along the entire diaphram (side to side). It kind of feels like something is 'folding' or pushing up under the sternum & ribs. My GP adv me to take 30mg of 2x daily for 12days and then 1x a day. On day 3 of returning to the 1x dosage; I began to exp palpatations/shortness of breath in addition to the extreme sternum pressure. GP put on a holter for the 24 hours. Told GP about the experience on the Prevacid and questioned if the 30mg was too much and she decreased my Rx to 15mg per day. I had not taken any Prevacid for over 48 hours and was beginning to feel better palpatation wise; however the reflux acid was up and pressure the same; so after having the new Rx filled took one 15mg of Prevacid. Within 45 minutes the palpatations were back with a vengance. GP refered me to an Internist who mentioned that only one episode was noted on the Holter of a heart rate incrase to 145bpm. I talked to her about the Prevacid and she advised me to quit taking it and manage the reflux w/Pepcid AC or Pepcid Complete over the counter; she advised 1 in AM and 2 in PM. The package insert says not to take more than 2 in 24 hour period. For 6 days followed package and did not take more than 2/24 hrs and slowly noticed a decrease of the palpatations but the sternum pressure has not lessened but was managing acid fairly well (sleep upright). Today there was increase of acid so I followed the Internists directive that I could take 3/24hrs one in AM and two PM... the palpatation/shortness of breath are back along with a feeling of 'distortion of reality'... i.e. like when you have 'medicine head' from taking cold medications. Stopped Pepcid and now on Rolaids and Maalox. As I had had the palpatations with two different 'types' of acid reducing drugs; research on the net found that Protonix; Prevacid; Prilosec; Nexium and Pepcid all have the advisment in thier package inserts that 'adverse experiences occurring in < 1% of patients' included Cardiovascular System disruptions -angina; arrhythmia; bradycardia; cerebrovascular accident/cerebral infarction; hypertension/hypotension; migraine; myocardial infarction; palpitations; shock (circulatory failure); syncope; tachycardia; vasodilation. I am scheduled for an Upper GI series as well as an echocardiogram. Is it possible that the medications are the underlying cuase of the palpatations? When I press 'firmly' and downward from the sternum towards my pelvic region; the pressure under the ribs/sternum is releived. Does that sound like the hernia may be worse? Can there be problems with someones diaphram that would cause this type of feeling under the sternum? I have lost 10lbs since this began and there seems to be less pressure pushing upwards.,2002,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello I am a 35 yr old male who has been suffering from unexplained abdominal problems for the past two months. A little past history first; two years ago I was diagnosed with Scleroderma Morphea. A Rheumatologist confirmed that it was not systemic this past January. A year ago I was diagnosed with hypertension 170/100. Prior to that I always had normal bp. Under meds (Lotensin; Atenolol and Tricor) I have low bp 95/60. About 8 weeks ago I was awoken by extreme pain just below the belly button which lasted roughly three hours; and I was tender for the next two days. I have had four episodes of these night pains since. I also have not slept thru the night in these 8 weeks and I am not sure what is waking me up. Since the first episode I have also been having short duration; varying in severity pains along either flank and across the bottom of the abdomen. I notice these pains only during the day; usually three to four times a day. On two different days I had 100,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Female - 41 years old - good health except suffer from palpitations. I take celexa because I have anxiety issues that my doctor seems to think contribute to my palpitations. I can sometimes go 2 - 3 days without any palpitations and then wammo I get them every 5 minutes every day! You just never know when to expect them. My question is I have been for an EP study because when I had a holter it picked up a short run of v-tach and I insisted that I get an EP study. They study showed up nothing but I continue to get these skips and flutters. Could they have possibly missed something do you think? My other question is that when I am excited; stressed or whatever my heart quite often starts going into these really fast beats and I get quite dizzy. It is really hard to explain; it is not like when you have been running it just all of a sudden starts going fast and I seem to be able to stop it when I take a deep breath and hold it or it just does one really hard bang at the end of the run and goes back to normal. Do you think that sounds like a short run of SVT or do you think that sounds like v-tach? It still scares the daylights out of me thinking that this could be v-tach. My doctor says know big deal even it is because I have a normal heart. Do you agree? These fast beats don't happen a lot. I can go months without the fast beats and then when I am stressed or anxious it seems to happen more. Could it just my heart reacting to adrelin do you think? I know the PVC's feel like a surge sensation and and then a big wammo and the fast beats don't feel like.,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question. Your answers to these questions are helping many people. I have had palpatations since I was 18; I am now 25. I just had a work up with a cardiologist who did an ekg and a echocardiogram. These test all came back normal. He said there was only a small leak or murmur on my mitral valve which I was probably born with. He said that I would just need to take a antibiotic before any major dental work. My family doctor said that everyone has small leaks and there is no such thing as a perfect heart. He then went on to say my EF was 60% which is excellent He couldnt really say what was causing my palpatations. When I went back to my Family doctor afterwards and had him do another holter(I did one back in 2002 and he said it only picked up ectopic beats and they were normal). That was a week ago and he hasnt called me back yet. I did catch alot of the palpatations on the holter. I will probably hear the same thing again benign palpatations. What is your opinion on my work ups. Are these test enough to rest my mind? I also am curious if the atenelol can ever make palpatations worse. I am on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night. I would like to stop taking it. My doctor thinks it is better to be on it to prevent the palpatations. I want to just ignore these palpatations but it is hard! I have normal BP at home always. but I do get spikes at the doctors. I have taken my monitor to the doctor and it is accurate; it just reads a little higher than his actually.,2004,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 29 yr old female; 5'6 1/2"; 150 lbs & used to be healthy . Since Jan; I've been having a lot of weird symptoms -episodes of racing heart (120); spikes/drops in bp (140/98 or90/58); leg tremors; flushing; lightheaded (while lying down;not upright); fatigue; blurry vision; jittery (extreme at times for hours; only seconds other times); itching face; especially eyes & nose; cold feet; achy legs; nausea; occasional hives; etc.. I can fell ok for days or weeks and then I hit a bad spell for days or weeks. I am unable to identify triggers; adide from heat; although many symptoms; especially hr & bp occur at night. Tests done: ekgs; echos; chest xrays; blood work; tilt table tests; eegs; mri (head; cervical spine; and abdomen); cat scans; 24 hour urines; stress test; and allergy tests. All were normal. Just recently; one batch of blood work showed low magnesium. I am taking supplements. I've seen every doctor in multiple disciplines and many could not find anything wrong. Multiple tests on heart and thyroid and even looked for rare things like pheo and carcinord. Last week Hyper beta adrenergic syndrome was suggested. Can you tell me more about that disorder. Toprol was prescribed but haven't started. Tried beta blockers before and didn't really help. Florinef sent me to ER with bp 154/105 three times and made me feel horrible. Prednisone did the same. Verapamil raised hr & bp. Lopressor made me feel horrible and thirsty. Nadolol gave me an irregular hr. I also just started getting vibrations in/under left breast that last few seconds. What is that?,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have PPCM; I am 6.5 yrs out and my EF is around 45% on my last Echo; it showed I had all of these with the mild diastolic dysfuntion; mild systolic dysfuncton; and mild concentric ventricular hypertrophy. and lastly mild aortic valve sclerosis is it comparable to the 45% EF? Or is it something I still need to watch for. Thank you very much.. I was just switched to Coreg becuase the 200mg of Toprol XL wqasn't working anymore. I am also on enalapril; coumadin(stroke) HCTZ andpotassium. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Last edited by amyls : Today at 07:45 AM.,2004,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,So every so often (maybe about 1 to 5 times a month) I feel; well; just plain odd. I get these spells where I feel like I'm not here. I look around me; and I feel like nothing is real. I can also be looking right at my hands; feet; or at myself in the mirror and I feel so confused. almost like I don't know who I am. I then feel tense; scared; my heart beat raises; and I feel like I'm going to faint. Now while this is happening; I have been able to control my thoughts; and I even experimented even under the deepest of fear; to state my name; my address; phone number; parents names; brother; girlfriend; all of their information; e-mail addresses; websites; and I pass all of these tests; but I still feel like I'm about to freak out! This all started October of 2003; one day my parents went out on a trip for the day; and I was on fall break from school. I was about 17. I had gotten out of a relationship; which at the time was still beatin me up pretty bad; I was depressed. So later that day I had decided; I was going to smoke weed; by myself; no one around; and just relax; and let life flow; while being high. Well; about an hour after smoking I started to browse around my computer; and noticed I was unable to concentrate on anything; I couldn't read; nor click my mouse on the right target. I then decided that I would just give it up; I was too high to play around; so I leaned back in my chair and started starring at the sealing. While doing this; I kept slowly bringing my head back down from a full upward look; but there was another issue. everytime I would look straight up; and back down; my images would get stuck; and my head would just nod and would never come back down; unless I really forced it to. I then began to get a little scared; and decided "ok; thats enough!" I went to get up; and that's when I felt it; FEAR! Fear like I've never known; so powerful I then started to grab my chest; which got real hot; and I started to panic; I then felt like no matter how much air I took in; I wasn't getting any at all; my vision became a tunnel; I some how got out of my chair; and began to run down the hall way; thinking I was going to die; my vision reacting slow; as if it were taking only pictures; and never streaming like normal. I then ran into my guest room; and landed on a couch; where I then felt pain all over my body! burning sensations going up my neck; into my brain; it burned so bad! my vision was finally restoring; but then I saw flashes of light; as if cameras were all around me! my heart rate was like a drum roll; so fast; I thought I was going to die! I was too afraid to call anyone for help; I thought if anyone came to the door it would make it worse; and all I could think about was "we can't call the police for help; because they will find the weed!" and that thought alone; the fact that I still had to hide it; pulled me through; but I was seeing images in my brain; and hearing myself scream for help; but only in my head; this all lasted for what felt like forever; but maybe 5 to 10 min. When I started to come back down; I turned on the tv; so I could have something to pay attention too; and I had to fight myself to concentrate; and I was so afraid for anyone to knock on the door; or to pass out; because maybe I would go through it again! I then laid there for about 30 min; and decided to take a cold shower; still shaking with fear; in the shower; I kept feeling fear; non-stop; so I got out about 10 min later; and tried to sleep in my room; but I was too afraid to sleep! but finally I did. I woke up about 6 hours later; still kinda shakin up; my parents had come back from their day out; and I decided to goto a friends house and tell the 3 people there what happened; but they all looked at me like I was insane. And that was that; it was my first (to what I believe) Panic Attack. later that year; and in 2004; I only had mild fears; and nothing to this nature ever returned. So now here we are; in 2007; August; and I still fear that this may happen again one day. But more recent; I just feel the warmth in my face; and fear; my vision sometimes slows down; and I do not feel real; and most of the time; if I splash water on my face; or grab a wet towel; I'm fine. so now I'm thinking a mild case of OCD? Now the thing is; before that torturous day in October; I had NEVER felt like that; EVER! And ever since that day; I've had anxiety. So it seems to me; that my mind is stuck in a loop; and I just need to boot it out! Now for a little background on myself; and family As for myself; I'm about to be 22; I'm about 300 pounds; 5'6 and have hypertension (high blood pressure) I take 50 MG of atenolol twice a day to regulate this; and take no other meds. my mother suffers from depression and anxiety; and my father has some anxiety; but nothing out of the ordinary; and they never have that bad of a spell to my knowledge. I'm a pretty easy going guy; I do have a lot of stress; and am looking forward to getting in shape; taking some martial arts; and eating better; because I fear diabetes as well. I have one older brother; who to my knowledge; doesn't suffer any symptoms; but has a HUGE problem with spending money haha. I have a current relationship that's lasted for 2 years; and life is good aside from the normal stress of everyday life; and retail. So I ask; am I ok? am I normal? Thank you all for you time! and I look forward to a response!,2007,2007,21,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I cant drink anymore. I barely start getting drunk and I just hate it because of anxiety. I never used to drink that much but I loved it soo much. Everywhere else I've read people say alcohol helps anxiety temporarily (and worsens it long-term or for the hangover); but I just cant get drunk anymore. I think I have general drug anxiety. Like I cant smoke weed either (yes I know what marijuana does). Anytime my state of mind starts changing (which happens during the day; sober) I start freaking out. It's the derealization kind -- I associate head changes w/ derealization which a couple weeks ago I had really really bad. It sucks I wish I could get drunk again. Maybe I should try getting completely hammered -- the past two times I tried to drink I didn't have very much cause I started freaking out. I actually felt really good though afterwards I don't know why (like right now lol I'm actually pretty happy; slightly hungover; but feel "in reality" kind of like the opposite of derealization). I wish I could just stop worrying about things and instead enjoy stuff.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; This is just to give you a brief summary; My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram ; Kerala followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumour in his left thigh which was also removed next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Surgeon could only remove 90% of it as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.)The pathology report for the thigh tumour and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type I think). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumour is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumour is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumours related to the liposaroma I would really appreciate your expert opinion. Will he benefit and withstand the cyber knife therapy.? I shall be grateful for an expert openion on whether cyber knife treatment will be useful for my father in law and will help in prolonging his life without much depreciation in the quality of life. The points for consideration are: 1. whether CK can be effectively used with this size of tumour in abdomen? 2. whether CK should be availed after further debulking surgery 3. what consequences are there if CK is applied to larger size tumour 4. whether CK can be effectively used for lung nodules which apparently has not grown so much 5. whether application of CK can increase his quality of life and /or life span 6. Is there any other palliative method to make his life comfortable If it is not inconvenient to you a reply by 15th Nov 09 will be highly appreciated as we are in the process of showing him to HCG enterprises Bangalore who have CK installed recently. We have taken some advice from Appollo Chennai and HCG Bangalore on the basis of documents. Appollo hospital advises to to debulk first thru surgery and then apply CK while HCG says even 2o cm tumour it fit case for CK treatment ; subject of course to their seeing latest CT scan.

Atenolol+hypertension,I was told I had atrial fib back in march because of my irregular heart rate.It is not always in a irregular rythym though.So Im wondering if I actually have it.My problem actually is though my heart races incredibly fast.My doctor had yet to figure out that problem.I am now on a events monitor because he wanted to know how fast it was and I could never count the beats.Well it happened and it started racing so I hit the record button and it recorded at 234 beats per min. Im assuming this isnt to dangerous because it has happened alot before.Maybe once a week or once every month.Its very unpredictable.Im not on any meds; only a aspirin daily.Im waiting to go back to the doctors.Dont know what to do? thanks donna,2009,2009,41,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Robin on June 19; 1999 at 12:07:01 I am 34yr. old female and have been diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. I am currently taking 20mg. of monopril(10mg 2 x day); 50mg of atenolol 1 x a day; 20mg. lasix as needed; asprin 325mg. a day; and xanax as needed. My problem and questions are about the monopril. My doseage was increased to 20mg. in march.I had been feeling ok except for about the past month I have been experiencing periods of dizziness; nausia; faint feeling; weakness; extreme fatigue; edema & tiredness. I had most of these before the increse only now they are more prominant. I recently started cardio rehab and on my first visit they wouldnt let me do much because my blood preasure would suddenly drop from abou 117/72 to about 78/60. They were on the phone with my cardiologist most of the time and they said he seemed to think it was no big deal. My preasure came up with activity. I was having one of my moderatly "bad" days that day. They advised me to monitor my preasure several times a day and to not exert myself outside of the rehab center. my next two visits I had no problems.The RN suggested that it was my monopril causing all this. QUESTION; 1 If meds are the cause; why do I only have symptoms some of the time? I can go weeks sometimes feeling good. QUESTION 2; do all ACE inhibs. have these affects? QU. 3; will exercise offset the side effects? I am no longer having the monster attacts of irregular heat beat( i still have mild ones) and arrythmias since taking the monopril and I dont want them to come back. But now I have other life altering symptoms. QU. 4; Will I ever feel normal again (havent in four years) or should I just except the fact that I am sick and there isnt much that can be done? I am hopeful rehab will help me feel better. Thank you soooo much for all the info. you supply on this board. I have learned alot.,1998,1995,,

Atenolol+hypertension,My names Chris; I'm 22; and a college student. I developed a tachycardia problem after I lost over 75 LBS at age 16. I'm now 22 and I weight 179 and i'm 6 foot 2. I suffer from an unknown tachycardia problem that none of the 6 cardiologists and 1 electrophysiologist can figure out. I can't exercise at all which is weird because i was athlete before i lost the weight. I'm now also scared to do any exertion because I can feel my heart in my throat non stop. Even if i dance a little; or do some push ups; my heart is beating so hard and I have to take deep breathes. I have tachycardia with going to the bathroom; the HEAT outside; eating heavy meals; and especially exertion. The problem is debilitating and handicapping my life. I've seen 6 cardiologists like i've said and also an electrophysiologist. I've had multiple thalium stress tests; CT angiogram with dye contrast; hundred echos; hundred EKGS. Tilt table test; event monitors; holter monitors. I've had some tiny episode of svt show up on monitor and atrial flutter once; also had anvrt show up once. My heart is structurally normal; i've also had all the blood work possible and a brain mri and also aortic anuersym check up 3 times. Ultra sounds of all organs so i've done it all basically. My question is ANYONE HAVE ANY INPUT ON WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT? I CAN'T GO OUT WITH FRIEND; NO GYM; NO BEACH; I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF LIVING IS; IF I'M HEALTHY BUT YET FEEL LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD. I'M CONVINCED I HAVE A BLOOD BLOT THEY CAN'T FIND OR A HEART DEFECT. I JUST FEEL LIKE SINCE I FEEL THIS STUFF THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG AND EVERY DAY I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT DROPPING DEAD NOW. ANYONE HAVE AN INPUT OR OPINION OF SOME KIND?,2010,2010,22,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,After searching the internet and coming up with nothing time and time again about this mix... I am left in a slight dilemma. Firstly;I take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg per day for depression. I find it is working well for me. It does not cause me to be agitated at all. In fact; I feel totally normal on it. It has had the opposite effect on me I find; making me more relaxed or sleepy at times. I take the Wellbutrin XL at 8am everyday. By the time 5pm rolls around; I want to hit the gym. I live in dreary climate.. London; and I find I need something to help me weight train and have energy; get results etc. so I started taking a Bsn product some might consider controversial called No Xplode - ingredients listed below -- a nitric oxide / caffiene supplement. Reason why I am posting here is I really need a solid answer. I moved here from the U.S a few months ago and doctors here are not familiar at all with the drug Wellbutrin to treat depression - they seem to know less than me about it's effects and how it works.. so I can't ask my MD here.. I get my Wellbutrin from my dr. in the U.S - who I don't think would know what no xplode is over the phone.. So I need help from someone who knows.. I have not noticed any negative effects but I just started taking the n.o and i only take 1 scoop - the lowest dose/// I also take cell mass; a creatine supplement.. but I could cut that out if need be. Mainly; I find without the sports supplement I can't weight train properly and get good results - which in turn when I have a good workout and see results; I feel better in general; and happier - however; I am concerned about any long term effects or damage I might cause; with neuro transmitters etc. when combining these substances .. Here are the no xplode specs -- anybody know the deal? or know of a safer; better supplement for weight training / energy; muscularity etc? "NO-Xplode is a Nitric Oxide boosting; muscle enhancing energy drink mix. The main component of NO-Xplode is its MetaFusion™ blend of ingredients.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I'm a 28 year old male who recently wen to the ER for what I felt like was a heart attack. The problem is; I didn't actually go until the day after I had the attack; since I wasn't sure if I was having a panic attack or not and figured I would rest through the night to see if my condition improved. The doctor ran an EKG that came up perfectly normal; and they tested my heart rate and blood pressure; with slightly high blood pressure (138/80) being the only thing found. (I'm aware of my borderline hypertension; but they say its not bad enough to require meds). The doctor diagnosed me with having anxiety (being that I have a stressful work life); and prescribed me with lorazepam. Let me recap the night: I was sitting at home just watching TV with a friend; and we had just finished smoking a bowl of marijuana. I started to get light pains in the left hand side of my chest; upper back; and left shoulder. A few fingers in both hands were getting numb. In discomfort; I kept moving around in my chair trying to see if I just had bad posture. Eventually; I had a feeling right near my heart that felt like my heart stopped pumping for a second; followed by what I felt like was a surge going through my heart; causing my back to arch and for me to take in a deep breath. I also then felt some blurriness in my vision; and a slight soreness around my eye sockets (not the same soreness as I would get from smoking marijuana.) After the attack; I laid on the floor of my home face down to see if I could calm the attack. My dog ran from the other room without me making any noise at all and wouldn't stop trying to nudge himself closer to me. I sat there for about 30 minutes as the pain began to subside. I felt weak. throughout the course of the night; I would have mini "heart stopping" episodes that weren't nearly as bad as the first one; and I had a soreness underneath the back of my left shoulder blade and the left side of my chest for the rest of the night; and a couple days to follow; with a weird light fluttering feeling near my heart happening at random times after the attack. A couple days later; I tried to just smoke 3-4 hits of marijuana to see it triggered the attack; and I just felt some slight chest discomfort; nothing more. SO I figured I had just smoked too much the other night; causing an anxiety attack. I've been smoking for 7-8 years almost every day; and I don't see how an anxiety attack could just pop up at random; but the doctor told me that's what happened. The NEXT day; I smoked just 2 hits out of a bowl; trying to lightly smoke. I had another severe attack; with the same symptoms as the first attack. I laid on the floor and clutched at my left shoulder and massaged the left side of my rib cage until the pain subsided. I then went to sleep feeling weak and tired. Lately; I've been doing a lot of research on heart attacks and anxiety attacks; just to see what I may have been experiencing the night I had the attack. There are a few things that bother me about his diagnosis. From what I understand; panic/anxiety attacks can cause a rapid heart beat and frantic thought. My experience was just the opposite. My heart wasn't beating really fast; it felt like there was some sort of blockage to my heart; and that it "seized" up momentarily. I wasn't frantically thinking about anything; just trying to take deep breaths and almost meditate while on the floor. Anxiety attacks also seem to cause a pressure in the center of the chest; where mine was mostly concentrated to the left side of my chest. DId I have a mild heart attack; possibly due to some other heart condition that I'm not aware of; triggered by the marijuana smoking? Or is it possible that even with all this information; I just had an unusual anxiety attack? I have an appointment to see a cardiologist in about a week for a stress test; but I want to see if I can get some educated responses about my experience. Please; no "you should just quit marijuana; it's illegal" or "drugs are bad" talk. I'm looking for educated opinions. Thanks in advance..,2011,2011,26,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone; Just wondering if it’s possible that my heart focus (cardiophobia) can lead to the very low blood pressure or high blood pressure I have daily? Same for the pulse rate; sometimes it’s so low that I think I will faint and sometimes I entering into superventricular tachycardia who last 2-3 hours in a row with a pulse of 160 and more… I ask this cause last week I had a holter monitor 24 hours to record my heart and the pulse rate cause I have superventricular tachycardia almost everyday since 1 month and strangely; the 24 hours I wear the holter monitor; I was able to do a lot of physical tasks and had NO chest pain at all; had no tachycardia (only in the morning but was around 110 for 1 hour or less) and when I return to the hospital to have the holter monitor remove; as soon as I return in the car; my heart start going crazy again; in the eveniing the chest pain was back; the morning after I had a very fast pulse rate of 160-180 for 3 hours in a row; had the same fast pulse rate at the end of the afternoon after I take a normal bath… Same for the blood pressure… It was high for the whole month; especially the diastolic number ( around 150/95-110); and now it’s seem to be low ( around 110/55-60)… I’m quite worried about all of this and also confuse… Why suddenly my blood pressure return to the low side while I had it higher for the whole february month??? IS it me who monitoring too much my blood pressure and pulse rate or I pay to much attention to it??? When my blood pressure is too high I feel bad and think that I will have a heart attack or a stroke… and when my blood pressure is slow; I feel like I will faint; my pulse rate is higher and I feel bad also… it’s seem that I feel all the time bad cause of my heart… I’m a little bit frustrated cause the holter monitor will give normal results and my Cardiologist will call me and say I have nothing wrong BUT in fact I have a lot of weirds things who happen with my heart since a while… the chest pain; the back pain; numbness of my left arm and hand; headache with pulsating veins on the temple of my head all the time; eyes pain; dizziness; intolerance to physical exercise; emotionnal stress will trigger superventricular tachycardia; things like that… Of course; my family Doc do some test at his clinic when I saw him last week and find out that my blood pressure and pulse rate are weird; he took my pulse rate when I was standing and ask me to do some exercise in his office and take my pulse rate again 1 minute after and my pulse rate who was at 70 before jump to 168 with only minimal physical exercise… same when i’m sit and when I stand; I have a big difference in my pulse rate as well as my blood pressure… it tend to be lower for the blood pressure while i’m standing than when i’m sit… Sometimes I wonder if the Klonopin and the Xanax can lead to those weird symptoms? I’m now so anxious about all of this that I link some foods to the fact that my blood pressure or my pulse rate is high or low… that’s like an obsession… I barely eat now cause I fear to have a bad reaction to food that I eat!!! I also loose 21 pounds in less than 2 months… no wonder why…. For example; everything with calcium increase my blood pressure and reduce my pulse rate… fruits and vegetables tend to make me sick (intestine pain and bloating; chest pain) and decrease my blood pressure; bread; pasta; rice tend to increase my blood pressure BUT can also lower it… I now fear to take my vitamins that I need daily cause of my gastric by-pass surgery I had to loose weight years ago… the Iron pills will increase my blood pressure; the Vitamin D will decrease it; the Calcium pills increase it OR lower it; the Vitamin A tend to increase it… I now give up on the beta-blocker; I try the Acebutolol 3 times and had bad reaction to it… I had some Inderal pills and since one month I was used to take 2.5-5 mg of Inderal when I had the superventricular tachycardia and it was reducing a little bit my pulse rate but was making me a lot anxious cause of the low blood pressure I had with it (low systolic number but ; I don’T know why… and mno difference for the diastolic number); my Family Doc RX another beta-blocker last week; it’s call Atenolol and I try it 2 times and felt very bad on it also; worse than on the Inderal… It’s like my adrenal glands are all ****** up… can’t tolerate low dose of beta-blocker… Anyway… i’m tired of this situation… I now fear to get out of my bed in the morning cause my heart always race… at daytime my pulse rate increase and decrease all the time; who is normal when you have normal pulse rate but on me it’s not normal cause it’s always too high or too low…. ; I can’t fall asleep at night or nap at daytime even if I feel completly exhausted; who is strange cause in december and january I was sleeping more than 8 hours in a row and was doing long nap at daytime without any problem… I now have to take some Remeron at very low dose (3 mg maximum before bedtime to be able to fall asleep… under 3 mg the Remeron don’t affect the adrenaline release… but it’s now begin to be not effective and don’t want to increase the dosage to more than 3 mg cause I don’t want the adrenaline receptor to be touch… What to do with all of this? My Therapist don’t seem to know what to do right now… Thanks for you support!,2010,2011,,
Atenolol+hypertension,This discussion is related to Develop rapid heart rate while sleeping. I am sorry that I am glad to hear of other folks with exactly my experience. My doctor suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apenia whereby my oxygen levels are reduced to a level while I'm asleep; that triggers a systemic panic response that results in the racing heart and panic attacks that I've been having at night. I have now completed two sleep studies and have be diagnosed with severe sleep apenia. I also read more on the health effects of sleep apenia and found that it's related to high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; and other cardiac issues. I am starting using my CPAP machine tonight; ironically enough. I'll let you all know how it goes with my heart racing/panic attacks. Best; Liz,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I've experienced 3 episodes of tachycardia while sleeping in the last week. I feel a fluttery feeling in my chest with a "burst" of tachycardia causing my heart rate to peak at 140 BPM for approx 3-4 minutes. My doctor placed me on a 48 hr holter monitor (wasn't able to catch any of the episodes; of course) and the results were PVC's and sinus tachycardia which my doctor says are benign. She's ordered a stress test to cover all bases and told me that if the stress test is normal she wasn't going to worry about. By the way; I have suffered from panic disorder and lived med free up until Nov 99. I've been on 20 mgs of Paxil. I'm worried because when I experienced these 3 episodes I've had no anxiety or panic associated with it. Please give me a second opinion if possible. Thank you for your time. This is a wonderful site that is performing a great service for alot of people. Keep up the good work.,2000,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had heart palpitations since I was a teenager so I have had it for about 20 years.I have had two children and I am now 9 weeks pregnant. About seven years ago I was having the heart palpitions quite bad after I took a prescription drug to try to lose weight. I was sent for an ekg and I wore a holter monitor for a couple of days. Both said that nothing was wrong. The doctor thinks that my heart is "nervous" I have had to deal with anxiety spells and depression after the birth of my second child. I am no longer on any antidepressants and I feel that I am not bad enough to take them any longer. For the past couple of weeks I have noticed an increase in the palpitations and skipping. It is now every day and it occurs alot during the day. I was just wondering could it be the pregnancy or is something else going on now. They have increased more over the years and my grandmother has a pacemaker. My mother also has the palpitations bad and there has been a lot of heart attacks with death in the family. I would appreciate any input. Thank you.,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I had my cardiology appt ; consulatation today for first time and now I am more confused than ever. Why is it that dr.s can not agree on tests results; etc? After my apparent heart attack early April; Severe squeezing pain to mid chest; pain to jaw; sweating; nausea; rise in blood pressure; feeling faint; feeling of impending doom; lasted about 15 minutes; went home.not to E.R. ( big mistake.) has stress test May 12; 08 Test was given a Persantine injection ; since I can not use the tread mill; allso radioactive dye to take pictures of heart. The test showed what is called REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT; THE REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT N THE INFEROSEPTAL REGION AND THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOKINESIS OF THE SEPTUM AND INFERIOR SPETUM NEAR CARDIAC APEX. AND MID CARDIAC SEGMENT. THIS AREA DOES NOT PERFUSE NORMALLY ON STRESS IMAGING;. THE SIGNIFICENCE OF A PARADOXICAL PERFUSION DEFECT VARIES BUT THIS CONDITION MAY OCCUR WITH A RECENT MI. PARTICUARY AFTER REVASCULARIZATION OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.CLINICAL CORRELATION IS ADVISED. My dr. accepted this as the result of my chest pain episode in april; all the classic symp. of a MI. The dr. forums here; Clevleand Clinic advised that is sounds as if I did indeed have a MI; though mayby a lilttle one; and that I would possibly need an echocardigram with left heart catherization and hopefully the Myocardium was only stunned and still alive. Now the Cardiologist I saw today didnt neccesary think the same thing; he said there are lots of reasons for Chest pain; but could not specify one; ( I don't have heartburn; indigestion; panic attacks; pleurisy; pneumonia; chest muscle pain or pulled muscle; gallstones or stomache pain; these are the obvious ones. ) I think one thing that threw him off was the fact that my chest pain episodes do not have any particualr pattern; and occur at any time of the day without exercise stressors. I get squeezing tightness in chest; burning pain in my throat; shortness of breath; nausea ; faint feeling; rise in blood pressure and heart rate; and fear. Need to sit down. The nurse even said; ' don't call them Angina." I don't know what else to call them as I have never had them before this MI ( feeling...) in April. I can not predict when they will occur. The nurse allso considered my blood pressure of 148/84 ( normal and good ) after taking my blood pressure pill????Anyway; the dr. decided to do the Cardiac Catherization to rule out once and for all what I have or don't have going on with my heart. Are all dr. s this hard to get an opinion ; why do dr. s disagree so much? Has anyone else out there had a reverse Perfusion Defect on their Stress test? I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to think. Is it allways so hard to diagnose problems like this? If I would have gone to the E.R. I would not be having this problem now. There is a part of me that wishes I would have an attack in front of a dr. so I can get a diagnosis. It should not be like that. Any ideas.? fluffypurrcat,2007,2008,54,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Kitlyn. I was just wondering if you were still out there and saw my post in response to yours under my page on Dysautonomia?? If you truly want to seek help; post to Ryan (RCA619) on the Anxiety Support Forum. I also have an entire topic discussing the problems and the results from the neurologist/physiologist there. Ryan has helped me to open my eyes to the possibility that I am not suffering from anxiety only; and particularly due to my reaction to the SSRI meds. he recommended that I may have some varient of dysautonomia and to get checked for it. If you haven't already; please check out the topic there; or start your own topic so Ryan (RCA) and I can further assist you. This is not the place for people dealing with panic attacks and dysautonomia. I usually get better support and comfort there too; esp. with Ryan there; who has opened my eyes to a lot of things. ~Crystal,2007,2007,23,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,i'm 26; male; normal ekg;ecg;stress test; x-ray and blood work; bp and holter monitor.i am wondering some things since reading more about pvcs and pacs and i have these questions: 1 what prevents a pvc from becoming v-tach in myself at any given time? 2 i had a weird chest sensation on the stress test; but my heart reading was normal; it was a STRANGE GROSS feeling; does that still make my heart ok? 3 i have pacs too; what is preventling me from going into a=fib? 4 is it normal to have pvcs with hiccups? i know that sounds werid. i do. every hiccup a skipped beat...I HATE HICCUPS NOW! 5 on the stress test i had no pvc's nothing; but when i exercise at home i get them alot; becuase i didn't have them on my test; would that alter the results? or am i ok regardless becaue of the test results and i should ignor the ones i get at home? 6 is it true that more then 6 pvcs in a min can be fatal? i have 5 in a min before. 7 a person on this forum had 100% good results yet ended up in a-fib and now she/he has nsv-tach. i worry this could be me? why should i not worry about this? my results were the same. 8 i will be moving away from my home town soon and feel scared about my heart "problem". i would appreciate answers to my questions in hope that it will help me understand whats going on with my heart. i want to figure this out to collect my nerves again and live. i appreciate your time doctor and your patience. this has well disrupted my life and i need informative answers that won't leave me doubting or wondering more afterwards. thanks and i look forward to your answers,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am an obese 51-year old female who has always had a relatively low BP (90/60 to 100/70) and a fast resting pulse (about 100) and respiration (about 25/min). This was true when I was a teenager and it stayed the same even with aging and a weight gain of about 90 lbs. When I exercised; my pulse always went way up--I was permanently forbidden to come to an aerobics class when I was in my 30's because my pulse had gone up to 220 (the instructor took it herself because she didn't believe me) during the routine exercises. On exertion; it was often about 180; but I got used to it and my doctors never paid any attention since I felt fine. 2 years ago I had an attack of atrial fibrillation that no one could explain. Since everything was fine on the echogram and the exercise test went OK; although they mentioned that they couldn't use the machine's program because my starting rate had been above 100 and it went up to 230 with no problems; they let me quit the meds and I had no trouble until this April. In an extreme emergency situation where I was in charge; I suddenly felt weird; everything greyed out; my head felt like exploding; and I felt like I had a blood pressure cuff on my left arm too tight. My BP (after the crisis) was still 150/110 and since that day; I have had high diastolic BP (about 135/95); ankle swelling; and some exertional dyspnea. Soon after the emergency; I had minor surgery and the anesthetist couldn't control my heart during the procedure. I went into a-fib again; and so I was put on a tiny dose of atenolol (25 mg a day in divided dose) and lanoxin (0.125 mg/day). Even this little bit of atenolol knocked me out--for 5 months I felt sick and exhausted and had horrible nightmares; but my BP and pulse were "normal" though I felt like I was going to faint if I even went upstairs because my CO was only about 3.5-4 and wouldn't go up when I needed to run; etc. They took me off it (kept the lanoxin) and I feel fine again; but now the BP is back up and the resting heart rate is about 115. Nothing evil shows up on the EKG; and the echogram only shows some trivial valve changes that the doctor said he couldn't have measured with the machine he had last year; but were probably always there. There is a little diastolic dysfunction; but again he says it is so tiny that it should not be doing anything. He is going nuts about the heart rate; even though I tell him it has been like that all my life. He says I must have inappropriate sinus tachycardia and should be treated for it; but I still wonder if I didn't have some kind of heart episode that day in April and maybe some damage that doesn't show up on the echogram. Is this possible? Can a person have a tiny infarct that zaps the sinus node or something? Is my heart just finally giving in to overweight and inactivity?? I hate to have him fry me unnecessarily and probably to no avail. I know you can't diagnose over the Net; but I'm just wondering what the possibilities are and how to test for them. Thanks for any help you can provide--Helen Stanbro,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I thought I'd start a thread to document my withdrawal from Effexor due to the multitudionous threads elsewhere worrying about it. First of all I am a 12 stepping recovering alcoholic (dry since Apr 5th 2011). I am not an evangelist about these things but I know its working for me. I live in the UK I am not very good with the 12 step thing - but I am getting there. Second; I have been on Effexor for several years - max 75mg - currently on 37.5 mg generic - and the manufacturer of the month is ..... TEVA (they vary). I also take 37.mg atenolol (beta blocker) for anxiety / blood pressure. I have been on sertraline in the past ( bad experience for me >10 years ago ) and Prozac (about 10 years ago - good for me) and more recently Effexor. I take ADs for GAD (generalized anxiety). I want to get off the Effexor because I want to try things the 12 step way and because of its perceived dependency. I tried to cold turkey Effexor about 4 years ago and it was disasterous - I went into some kind of rebound depression as the say; got the brain zaps; felt flu-ey; extremely irritable; nauseous and disassociated; brain foggy. Basically very very sh*t. It almost cost me my relationship - along with my alcoholism - and the fact that when I was withdrawing I told my wife I dont know if I loved her any more (we were having financial and consequently relationship problems at the time) has caused lasting damage - which I am hopefully continuing to repair. Even though it was a lot to do ith the withdrawal the damage was done. Here are some of my symptoms which contributed to the above and still trouble me. Lack of sex drive - I feel I "cant be bothered" or have no energy - this hurts my wife a lot - she thinks its her. Fuzzy/Foggy brain. Poor quality sleep ( I also have sleep apnoea which is treated with CPAP and is just fine according to my latest check up). Muscular tension/tension headaches Hyperchondriasis Impatience. Lack of focus/concentration. Mood swings. Wake up very early and tired (getting to sleep is quite easy now Ive quit the booze) Also I am fat now - a fat beer bellied ******* with a 45" belly on a much more slender frame. etc The truth is I dont know which ones are me and which ones are the Efffexor - if any. The truth is the Effxor helped in the beginning; but now I am trying to unmsk my true symptoms and deal with them a different way. Since I stopped drinking a lot of symptoms have eased; but of course dependent alcohlics get withdrawal too. So I have been dealing with the alcohol withdrawal symptoms for 3 months and now after 100 days (On Thursday) and I am moving on to the next thing. So I have several 100 day plans; as I call them. 1) Effexor. 2) Lose my belly 3) Stop smoking 4) Become RULER OF THE WORLD ... erm no .. that should say "curb my meglomanical tendencies" - or is that the Effexor ;) Of course AA says "Easy does it" - but like I said I am a bit impatient; but will listen to my body. I could go on and on - but I think that is sufficient background for now. Anyway; day one was Sunday 10th July - I took half a tablet (37.5mg/2 = 17.75mg). Yeterday Monday July 11th I took the same - maybe I felt a little odd on the dose reduction - maybe it was psychosomatic . I am going to continue on the 1/2 tablets for a week or two to see if there are any adverse or postive effects. I shall report when I make any changes or feel different otherwise it will be at weekends. I know this Effexor withdrawal stuff is different for a most of us; but if this helps one single person then I shall be a happier pig for it. If anyone wants to ask me stuff then feel free.

Atenolol+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I wrote once before. I was having a fast heartrate that was waking me up in the middle of the night/early morning hours. It scared me because my father was diagnosed with an arrhythmia and hypertension at 50 (though he was overweight; a smoker; and an alcoholic). I am 26 and in fairly good shape. My blood pressure is normal (or it was a few months ago)- slightly high at the doctor 130-138/70. The Holter was normal with a few extra "skipped beats" and a couple PVCs which I don't get very often. Echo was normal. I had an event monitor and everything I recorded was "fast; but normal- not SVT". I know that I have anxiety about this now; and I have been having a few panic attacks. But; if I don't "freak out" when it is going on this is what happens- I wake up and my heart is beating fast (probably 90bpm) then when I move it jumps up faster for a few seconds- then it pounds for a few seconds- with a noticable sinus arrhythmia; then it settles back to normal; but not as slow as my normal resting rate. My resting heartrate is normally about 53bpm. If I do panic it beats fast for 10 minutes or so. I have noticed that the night before it happens- I feel "reved up"- but not in a good way. It feels like there is electricity going through the pit of my stomach. I have a theory that it might be sugar related- could this be true? Maybe hormones? I have had migraines all my life. I used to be a ballet dancer; but I haven't been as active as I used to be in a long time. I do exersize; but not as much as I used to. I am tired of worrying. What do you suggest?,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 37;excellent health;used to exercise-running 3-4.5 mi./day 3-4X/wk until I had an episode of freq. PVC(3-5/min)after I was 1 mi. into my run one day several wks ago. I've had PVCs since my mid-20s. I've had 4 echos since(stress echo 9/03);holter monitor 3X(last 9/03);and event monitor for 2 wks. Monitors have always shown just scattered/rare PVC and PAC; exc. one 5-beat run of SVE. 1st echo(mid-20s)I was diagnosed w/MVP; 2nd echo('99): "mitral valve is minimally myxomatous. There is slight prolapse of the anterior leaflets." Conclusion;"Minimal MVP w/ trivial mitral insufficiency." 3rd echo 8/02-Doppler: "mitral valve is normal exc. for trivial mitral regurg; which is probably physiologic. Mitral valve shows no prolapse or thickening;" impression was; "Normal echo." Also said;"Aortic valve is delicate; normal and color flow is neg. Tricuspid valve shows no regurg; and there is no pulmonary hypertension." But; w/recent stress echo; baseline did show prolapse of the anterior leaflet; and was otherwise normal; baseline Doppler showed trace mitral regurg. and mild aortic regurg-new! "Post-exercise; MVP was more apparent." I began having isoloated PVC @ HR=139. Conclusion:"negative stress echo." Cardiologist offered Inderal; and said if it happens again to just keep running! I have never had freq. PVC during exercise; but seems to happen every time now-3-5/min; until HR slows down. Why might this be happening now only w/exercise? Should I be concerned? What about sudden diagnosis of mild aortic regurg? I don't have the mental fortitude to just keep running when it happens!,2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you doctors for participating on this board. I have my annual check-up with my cardio in a few weeks (actually it's been almost two years since I last saw him) and want this appointment to be productive. My first check-up lasted only about 15 minutes and I left feeling kind of disappointed. I would like your advice on what kind of questions and issues I should be bringing up (especially if he doesn't). My story: 55 yr. old male; afib for four years; occurrences start almost always at night in bed; usually terminated via some physical activity like long walks; tennis; etc.; episodes average 12-14 hrs.; twice a week; am taking metoprolol 25 mg. daily in two 12 1/2 pills (I cut up a 50 mg. pill into quarters) late morning and late afternoon; also take a baby aspirin daily; and no coumadin because I'm not 75 yet (because of my frequency and length; do you think coumadin is indicated?). I reduced the dosage because I read where vagal afibbers like myself should not be taking beta-blockers. Your opinion on this? Here's something interesting; I was only averaging a few hours per episode until I tried accupuncture about a year and a half ago and immediately; my episodes shot up to 10 hrs. plus. Maybe a coincidence but any effects from that accupuncture should be gone by now - but the frequency and duration are still here. Am also taking a host of supplements per stuff I've learned about like magnesium; fish oil; taurine; co-enzyme 10; etc. What suggestions do you have as to potential talking points? And how often are echos or stress tests done? Thanks; Keven,2002,2006,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Ok so im a 26 year old male and about a week/ 2 weeks before christmas i got sick just flu like stuff nuthing odd on the first day second day was worse so i called in to work and that day i noticed that i couldnt tell who ppl were by looking them in the face if they talked i knew who they were by their voice. Im not having problems seeing i can see fine i can read i can write but couldnt recognize anyone friends coworders family i didnt want to say anything to anyone cause about the time i say anything things stop so i waited and i waited near around christmas eve i started noticing that "some" ppl i could recognize by some i mean like 5 ppl; 3 family 1 friend and 1 customer from where i work. on christmas day i could recognize about half of my family there was about 65 or so family there. after that i started figuring out that i could recognize ppl by their hair styles. also from time to time it feels like i get pressure in my head near the temples and across the front between them and from time to time i get light headed and feel like im going to fall. the day this started i also had a pain in my upper jaw when i would move it around or open it wide today both sides now hurt when i do that. the week after christmas i started trying to get a doc to see me i say try because it took about 7 tries before i found one that would talk with me everyone else i tried to go see just told me that no one there could help me and i would need to find someone else that would went there and they took a ct scan and called me back said there was nothing on it no oddities. they set me up an appointment with a neuroligest but thats not till the end of march does anyone have any idea what this could or might be? the other day i told some of my family and my aunt said that the family had a history of mini seizurs but no one else in the family said anything so not sure she had a few of them some time back and when ppl talk to her sometimes she doesnt know what they are saying she can hear them but its like they are talking in another language,2009,2009,26,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I am 35 and three weeks ago I began having PVCs while lifting weights. I run too; but I don't suffer from any irregularities when doing that. It seems that the higher the heart rate the lower the occurance. I had a stress echo a week ago and everything was normal and that's when they diagnosed that I am having PVCs. I was wondering these three things. First; what could cause this situation from happening out of the blue? Second; could it go away just as quickly as it came? Last; is there any other tests that you would recommend to make sure that there is no problem with my heart? Thank you.,2003,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for taking my question. I have had skipped heart beats on and off for about 5 years. I,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I had a heart attack on Jan 15;... I am a 42 year old male who doesn't smoke; isn't overweight; has normal blood pressure; low cholesterol; (including quite low hdl which is a problem; apparently) and no previous heart problems or any other health problems. I have been exercising for years. My angiogram says that I have "100% occlusion of the anterior descending artery with collaterals from the left and right. 25% stenosis in mid circumflex 25% stenosis in distal right coronary artery Conclusions: Single vessel coronary artery disease. Grade II left ventricular function with anterolateral apical wall hypokinesis. I have been told to go home for 2 months and that; if I experience angina during routine activities; bypass surgery may be my solution. I have adopted a 10% plant based diet (Ornish; Esselstyn); and am hoping that this along with proper exercise; and rest; will make bypass surgery unnecessary. What I'm hoping is that the collateral circulation will continue to improve enough to restore the previous circulation equal to what my blocked artery could have provided.... Is this naive?.... or should I resign myself to bypass surgery? I only experience chest pain during exercise stress tests...not during routine activities....one lab technician; says that is not unusual considering how recent my heart attack was; and should improve naturally as my heart heals in the next few months....Is this a fair statement? I have also heard that one of the side effects of bypass surgery is a minor amount of brain damage.... this apparently being discussed in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year... thoughts on this? thanks in advance for your response.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My doc thinks I may have developed a collagen vascular disease 2 yrs. ago. I have many symptoms since: raynauds (diagnosed); overall cold intolerance; digestive problems; swallowing discomfort & esophagus spasms; etc. I also have cardiovascular symptoms: For 1+ years have had SOB on exertion (or at night); pounding heart and elevated pulse after exercise or eating; & increasing palpitations. Tests done: 4 echos; event monitor(EM); stress tests; EKG's; PFT's; lung CT-scans; & right-heart cath. due to suspected pulmonary hypertension (results normal). Abnormalities from above tests: 1)EM showed short bursts (5-15 seconds) of sinus tachycardia & SVT's. The palpitations are quick to start & quick to end seemingly with no trigger. 2)The RHC showed a high cardiac output (7.83) & high venous saturations. 3)Two echos showed apical & apical-lateral hypokinesis but later echos showed none. 4)My last PFT's were at 75% diffusion. I started Toprol-XL which has slowed heart & helped some with palp's. & helped with exercise - but more snorting at night. Questions: 1)Is there any significance to having BOTH sinus tach & SVT's? 2)Doc tells me not to worry about the SVT's but some of your information says they can be dangerous - is this true? 3)If my blood vessels are constricted in my body; could my heart be trying to compensate? 4)Since I have 2 kinds of SVT arrythmias -is there increased chances for VT? 5)Two echos at same clinic six months apart showed heart heart size increase but doc says this is due to test error - sound right?; 6)Where do I go from here? Thanks:),2003,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female who is in good health.Since October I have been dealing with palps; they drive me crazy. I have had a holter; echocardiogram and tests came back normal other than pac's; sinus tach.The past couple of weeks have been horrible I will begin my episodes around 4:30 pm and they will last until bedtime. When they hit they will come every 2-3 minutes feels like my heart is jumping out of my chest very distrubing. I saw my doctor on Monday and he drew blood again and ordered an event monitor. I wore it Friday events started at 5pm and I filled the monitor up by 9pm. I will be able to call it in Monday at 9am. I currently take a beta blocker; and also meds for panic attacks.My dad has atrial fib and that always concerns me that I am heading in that direction.I also have very low blood pressure 80/55.I also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis but the endo doc does not feel my numbers are abnormal; so I am not on thyroid medication. Questions??? Do you think it is atrial fib??? My heart rate does speed up a bit when these hit; but not much. Just seems to jump every few minutes or so. Would my low blood pressure cause the palps; I take 25 to 50 mg of atenlol per day. Only take 50 if they really get bad. Is it anxiety or my heart?? With my dad's history I just wonder. This is something new that I have never experienced in my years with panic disorder. What tests do I need but haven't had???? I appreciate your time! Would love to hear from others who are bothered by these darn things. Kelly,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi there and thanks very much for taking my question. I am a 36-year-old woman. For the best part of the last year I have been suffering constant and frequent skipped heartbeats. It all seemed to start when I decided it was time I started to take regular exercise. Prior to that I used to get a very big PVC only once every two months or so. But now I seem to get around two to four a minute. They are stronger at the end of the day. They are very typical of other people's PVC's: an uncomfortable and annoying feeling of something flipping over in my chest. I don't get breathless or feel pain or anything like that; but sometimes there is a bit of a "rush". My father has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I had a scan for HCM about ten years ago and was told I was clear; though a small murmur was detected. I really don't want to give up exercise: I can't believe that it's bad for me... I don't have any particular stress in my life and haven't drunk caffeine for over a year. Also I drink alcohol in extreme moderation. I keep thinking I ought to go and see my physician and get myself checked out; but haven't quite got around to it yet - mostly because everything I read seems to point to asymptomatic PVC's not being dangerous in most cases. Is it worth getting myself checked out? The PVC's are annoying; but I don't want to take any drugs if I can help it. I would rather just live with it. Also; I'm interested in getting a cosmetic surgery procedure done which would necessitate a general anesthetic. Would the PVC's present any problem? Thanks so much Kate,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 31 female; overweight but not extreme; non smoker. I have been living with PVCs since I was a teenager; but had them diagnosed in 99. I stopped with caffinated beverages and that helped tremendously. Well for the past month or so; they have been occuring on a more regular basis. I know; I know that they won't kill me BUT. Friday evening I had taken benadhryl for sinuses (dr told me it was the only medication I could take) and had a horrible reaction. I had a strange hot sensation of blood raging from the tips of my fingers to the tips of my toes. SO we go to the ER. The RN there told me that his wife had PVCs and that I was fine; put me on an EKG and everything was normal once my heart rate calmed down (that happened after he told me I wouldln't die) Major problem here??? I am having strange sensations when I try to go to sleep. Kind of like the pvcs but more of a almost fainting sensation. Has anyone ever felt this? Is this strange? I am planning on seeing a dr asap just to make sure everything is OK (never had the heart monitor on for more than 20 minutes). I am wondering if this is just me in a panic over my heart.. Yes I do have a stressful job/life and I paln on discussing that with the doctor too. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can share. Reading everyone's storys have helped me more than you know!,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have had numerous bouts recently with atrial Fib And have been in to see my physician. My physical went very well but he did detect a slight murmur and said I have a breathing arythmia. Meaning when I breathe my heart rate slow and speeds up! I have had an appointment with a cardiologist and he listened to me and thought it was a benign sort of thing! I am having a holter monitor put on tomorrow for 24 hrs. and thursday I'll have an echocardiogram done. My symptoms are sometimes a fast heart rate for me 90-100bpm..maybe 110. I experience missed beats or a pause in beats..right as I write this I'm getting 2-3 pauses per minute or so. I get tingling sensations in my arms and upper chest area. The feeling is scary as it happens alot at bedtime feeling a little like tightness or a muscle tightening in my left shoulder in the front. I have been able to put up with these episodes but they really bother me and sleeping is almost impossible.Can sleep deprivation make these worse? I have stopped all caffiene and alcohol...but still continue to have these almost daily..maybe more than once daily. What do you think I should do if all the tests come out negative? Should I proceed with more tests? Thanks for any input you can give me..,1999,1999,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me. Could you recommend anything. I am hanging by a thread. Thanks.,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello doc and thanks for taking my question. When I first found this site I was amazed at the number of people who share symptoms very similar to mine with no clear answer. There is a thread in the Family Practice forum with about 25 different people discussing mysterious head pressure. I appeal to you please to help us find an answer; I lost a good job in the airline industry and my friends and family have given up on me; and I've had to switch doctors 3 times due to them trying to psycho-analyze me and basically ridicule me; since my MRI was negative but I still insist there must be an explanation. I have seen a top University neurologist who specialty is headaches; plus another neuro. I woke up with day with an intense pressure deep in my head; extend to top of head and at eyebrows level. waves of anxiety; dizzy; nausea begin at same time. One clue seem to be a "trickeling" or "squishing" sound when I stretch my neck out or move my head around. If I extend my head upward and hold it stretched (like giraffe neck) and the sound happens I get temporarily great relief from the pressure...I must hold my head in the extended position to maintain relief but when I relax it comes right back. I can 99.9% say this sound is connected to symptoms because there is occasional day when pain/pressure is less and this squishing sound is hardly present. I was wondering first do you think my CSF could be somehow being blocked or slowed between cranium and neck (hence squishing sound) or perhaps poor blood circulation? Please help me return to my family and life; Paul/31;Toronto,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor: What type of exercise is needed to obtain collaterization of coronary arteres? Does it have to be very intense exercise such as running or can it be accomplished with brisk walking on a treadmill? Thanks for your time.,1999,2003,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for creating this forum. I know it is comforting to many. Heart arrhythmias are terrifying; as anyone who suffers from them knows. In my case; I've had PVC's and a mild case of MVP for years. However; I've NEVER had heart "palpitations" like those I've been experiencing in the past few weeks. I'm 47 years old; nearly 48...and peri-menopausal...(not fun!) I discovered that I was anemic a few months ago...blood count 9.8; so I started taking iron. I noticed an increase in PVC's around that time; and was so tired. Anyway; as my blood count went up; the PVC's increased instead of dissipated. Finally; a week and a half ago; they turned into bigimeny; which I have never had before...and which scared me to pieces! I ended up in the ER. Anyway; they did a CT to check for blood clots in my lungs; which was negative. I had had a thyroid check and electrolytes the week before...all normal. Well; my cardiologist seems to feel no sense of urgency in seeing me now. I already had an appt. for May 4 (before the ER incident); and he refused to see me any sooner afterward. I haven't seen him in six years; and the very first thing he wants to do is a stress echo test; without even doing an EKG or a holter monitor...or an exam. I tried to see another doctor; but no one in town will see me without a referral; and certainly not sooner than May 4. I have been very sendentary and exhausted with the anemia; and am afraid to do the stress test. I just want to know what is causing my problem!! Could it be hormonal? Is my doctor doing the right thing? Why a stress test?,1999,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,hi; I'm a 23 year old male in perfect health. i have seen 8 electrophysiologists one being second opinion from cleveland clinic since Nov. 05 and have had; 2 echos; 1 cardiac MRI; 2 stress tests; 3 holter monitors; and blood work; all tests came back normal. the holter monitor was the only tests that picked up PVC's and PAC's. the holters have picked up at the most 300 PVC's 900 PAC's and the least 3 PVC's and 98 PAC's. all this started after dieting and (ephedra free) diet pills. My questions are 1. my fear is that my PVC's will get worse as i get older and i will develop CM; it fears me more because of my age and that i have these now. do you see this happening in my case? 2. my PVC's seem to scare me more when i am aware of my heart especially during exercise or sex (seems to be when they occur more) so i've avoided these activities and that makes me fell bad that i have to avoid those things especially because of my age. besides the discomfort these cause; while i'm doing these activities does it matter if the PVC's come in groups or singles? 3. i'm on sectral (acebutolol) and all my doctors want to see me get off this medication within the next 3 months. is it true that sectral is the only beta blocker with the ability to surpress PVC's; it fears me to get off of them if they are acually supressing them and yet at my age i don't want to rely on a pill? thank you for your time!,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,hi. iv'e had chest pains for 3 years now. im 24 years old and i play competitive soccer so i am in good shape. i've had anxiety (sweaty palms and feet)since childhood; and gerd since 17 years old; but i keep a diet so it doesn't give me any problems. anyway i had mild chest pains for 3 years all located where the heart is; in the middle and left side of my chest and back.(i have all kinds of pains; burning(not heartburn); dull aches; rib aches;pains that feel like a little electric shock and pains that go from front to back of my chest).i did an echo the first year; multiple ekgs and two stress tests in this 3 year period; all with different cardios all came out good. ended up in the er once told it was panic attack. i took burspirone for anxiety but that did not help at all. about 4 months ago i went to a different cardio who said i had wpw. he did an echo that came out good. this is when i noticed i had palps too. gave me atenolol but it gave me more palps. last month i went to an ep; he is a proffessor at nyu and considered one of the best in nyc. he did an ekg and said that my heart is fine & i don't have wpw. i had other episodes of chest pains and palps so i called him twice. i asked if i should wear an holter or do further tests he told me my heart was strong and that although he understood that the pain and palps are real it wouldnt kill me i should learn to live with them. i still have pains and palps i can't sleep on my left side;i've stoped playing for fear of dropping dead. should i go to another ep and get a holter done; please help me.,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; "Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis"; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record. Thank you.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,This started last year. I woke up extremely dizzy; headache and had trouble speaking. Lasted about 4 hours. My eyes were not reacting to light. Months later; while at work I would be sitting and get dizzy out of clear blue. Co-workers often said I was slurring my words; which I was not aware of. Lately I have been waking up dizzy at least 4 times a week; lasting now two weeks. I am nauseated; feel pressure in back of my head; balance is quite off; blurred vision. I have had an MRI; which was normal; A stress EKG; where the EKG was non-conclusive; and the scan showed okay. I have Hasimotos disease; High Blood pressure; extreme Vitamin D defiency; and am taking 50;000ui daily; to have blood checked on June 29th. I currently take Lisinopril 20-25; Atenolol 50; Synthroid ;175; and I have sleep apnea; a Herniated lumbar disk at L3/L4-5. I have involuntary muscle spasms that affect mostly upper body; but sometimes lower extremities as well. I go back to doctor on 29th; and I need to know what to ask for in the way of more testing; because this is beginning to interfere in my daily activities. I am also a smoker and trying like hell to quit; and need to lose about 100 lbs. Any helpful insights would be appreciated. thanks; Karen,2010,2010,56,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,: Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on "spectral" and "verapimil". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible. I feel mine very strongly and they leave me somewhat short of breath after continuing for longer than about 1 minute (30-40 PVCs in one minute). I have tried most of the "...lol" meds (sotalol; pindolol; spectral; atenolol; acebutolol; enderal)and a few combinations of the above without any real relief. Though I have been told to just "forget them" I cannot; and they are seriously affecting my quality of life ( I dread getting up from a sitting position and walking because I know I will be "hit" with PVCs soon after I start walking). Could write much more; but in interest of brevity; I won't. : My question is: Is anyone doing cutting edge research or treatment on this particular arrythm? Can anyone help me with this life-altering condition. I am willing to try experimental meds or procedures. Please feel free to call me at 1-808-455-6864 (Pearl City Hawaii); write me at CDR Terry S. Wichert : 801 Date Drive : Pearl City; HI : 96782 : or e-mail me at ***@****. : Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply.,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have "conventional" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was "ischemic." I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore. I feel so stupid.,1998,1998,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Robin on June 19; 1999 at 12:07:01 I am 34yr. old female and have been diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. I am currently taking 20mg. of monopril(10mg 2 x day); 50mg of atenolol 1 x a day; 20mg. lasix as needed; asprin 325mg. a day; and xanax as needed. My problem and questions are about the monopril. My doseage was increased to 20mg. in march.I had been feeling ok except for about the past month I have been experiencing periods of dizziness; nausia; faint feeling; weakness; extreme fatigue; edema & tiredness. I had most of these before the increse only now they are more prominant. I recently started cardio rehab and on my first visit they wouldnt let me do much because my blood preasure would suddenly drop from abou 117/72 to about 78/60. They were on the phone with my cardiologist most of the time and they said he seemed to think it was no big deal. My preasure came up with activity. I was having one of my moderatly "bad" days that day. They advised me to monitor my preasure several times a day and to not exert myself outside of the rehab center. my next two visits I had no problems.The RN suggested that it was my monopril causing all this. QUESTION; 1 If meds are the cause; why do I only have symptoms some of the time? I can go weeks sometimes feeling good. QUESTION 2; do all ACE inhibs. have these affects? QU. 3; will exercise offset the side effects? I am no longer having the monster attacts of irregular heat beat( i still have mild ones) and arrythmias since taking the monopril and I dont want them to come back. But now I have other life altering symptoms. QU. 4; Will I ever feel normal again (havent in four years) or should I just except the fact that I am sick and there isnt much that can be done? I am hopeful rehab will help me feel better. Thank you soooo much for all the info. you supply on this board. I have learned alot.,1998,1995,,

Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as "non-sustained". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one. Thanks again. Terry,1998,1995,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I can't help but notice since I joined this community some months ago; people with skipped beats or palpitations tend to ask questions about PVCs. Like all flips in the chest are PVCs. The upper chambers in the heart are more "irritable" than the main chambers. In other words; they are more likely to produce premature beats (PACs). A few examples: Which is more common - A-fib (atrial) or V-fib (ventricular)? Which is more common - SVT (atrial) or VT (V-tach) (ventricular)? Both PACs and PVCs are usually benign; so it's really not an issue; I was just a little curious. Even so-called "wide complex beats" on EKG are often PACs. If a PAC occurs very early; it can show as a wide complex on EKG; because the right ventricle is a little slower recovering than the left; leading the electricity to the left ventricle; and then to the right; thus mimic a PVC that origin in the left ventricle. Just so you know :-),2009,2010,28,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 29 year old male. I have HCM Cardiomyopathy with a case of Afib. My Afibs are brought on usually on a full stomach. I usually have afib encounters every couple years however they have been becoming closer and closer. I have has the past two episodes back to back this past month. In the span of only a week apart from each other and I have been noticing lately my body almost going into a fib depending on the position i'm laying in or bending over when on a full stomach. The palpitations do become stronger when on a full stomach. I have IBS which was diagnosed after an endoscopy;small Hietal Hernia and Helicobacter pylori. My GI told me that I just have a nervous stomach but DOES NOT believe that the Vagus nerve and what I'm feeling going into a fib to be related to IBS or H pylori? Something doesn't seem right and I feel like my heart these past couple weeks has been very susceptible to a fib.When I followed up with my Cardiologist i went through the routine visit; EKG; ECG; Monitor etc. and everything seems to check out fine. So I believe that something in my stomach is binging on these episodes of Afib. Im not sure if its indigestion. I have heard that GERD can cause triggers to flare up AFIB as it irritates the Vagus nerve. But once again my GI does not believe its that either. I need some opinions because he believes in more natural solutions to problems and it kind of irritates me because I know something is wrong and it's related to my stomach. I followed up with him yesterday evening and he told me to start antibiotics for H pylori infection and later that night after I ate I felt again like I was going to have another episode of afib. Does anyone have the same symptoms? I'm really looking for some answers as I can not go on with life like this. I'm getting married soon and I can not think to start a family with these problems over my head. I need to be a Superman for my kids one day. Not an Old man. lol,2013,2013,28,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; Since a while I have some heart problems (POTS; dysautonomia; irregular heart rate aka tachycardia; low blood pressure OR high blood pressure). They are not well control by meds and my Cardio Doc seem to think it's only anxiety related with a physical deconditionning state and don'T offer a lot of support to me... A new symptom appear last february. I start having a pounding heart rate all the time even at rest. In fact; I feel my heart beat really HARD in my chest all the time; it's especially worse in the morning and late afternoon; after a nap in the afternoon; when I get up in the morning... At bedtime it's seem to calm down a little bit but I can't fall asleep cause of the constant pounding heart in my chest; I ear it and feel it all the time. I also don't sweat like in the past; I sweat mostly from hands and feet only. I feel like my head is hot all the time or seem to be intolerant to hot weater and temperature. Have to apply a cold compress on my head most of the time to reduce the hot sensation... it help at the same time for the chronic headache from the TMJ disorder that I also have. I take some Propranolol 10 mg x 3 a day; my dose was increase from 20mg to 30 mg but since it was increase last january;the only thing it's doing for my pounding heart rate and tachycardia is to lower even more my blood pressure and increasing my resting heart rate... I have severe anxiety not under control for now and the only time my blood pressure increase is when i'm out of the house; in a social situation or have to go to the dentist for example... and normally my distolic blood pressure number increase from 60 to 90 and the systolic increase from 100 to 130... I have a blood pressure machine at home; I take my blood pressure 3 times a day and find out that when my heart is pounding harder usually my blood pressure is in the low range; low for me is around 100/60; I had a normal blood pressure of 135/80 before I start having all those cardiovascular symptoms back in 2010... My pulse rate at rest is around 75 with the 30 mg dose of propranolol; without it it's about 100 at rest. The main problem is when I get up to walk and when I stay in a up position for a long time; my heart rate when I get up in the morning is about 130 sit at rest; when I get up it goes into the 160 and more. I can't exercise at all; will start a special exercise program for peoples who have heart diseases since my Cardio Doc think i'm in a physical deconditionning state... but I fear that attempting the gym to do the physical program will trigger another SVT attack or trigger more panic attack (usually have 1 to 5 panic attacks a day). My question is : I'm the only one here to feel my heart pounding in my chest all the time? I have another holter monitor 24 h test to be done in june; I can't see my Cardio Doc before having that test done. I need some advises about another med than the propranolol to control the tachycardia and reduce the pounding heart rate I feel all the time. Meds that I try so far are mostly all the beta-blocker; propranolol being the one with the less side-effects on me. I also try the Clonidine... Right now i'm on 7 mg of Klonopin a day with no effect on my anxiety at all... I'm also meds sensitive so that's why I can't start an antidepressant med to control my anxiety... Well thanks for any kind of answer I can receive here ;-),2011,2013,37,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,hello i was diagnosed in 1995 with Graves disease. I drank radioactive iodine and after several attempts i got my thyroid under control with synthroid. Ive had to change my doses due to my test becoming abnormal or high again. I started out at .75 and now Im up to .175 per day. Well the recent test i had done 4 weeks ago said my TSH was 13. So they repeated it last week and now its 16. I am scared. I am confused as to why it keeps going up. I have other health issues like diabetes type 2 (just recently diagnosed borderline etc) no meds just exercise and diet. Im morbidly obese. i am recently diagnosed with hypertension. 168/92 .... I weigh 316. I did weigh 335 but have lost since jan 1st; 2008. I guess the thing that scares me is this all is hitting me at once. I am going to lose weight to get down to my ideal BMI. I know my weight is alot of my problem and these problems would go away with weight loss. But why does my TSH keep going up? What are my risks? Is this dangerously high? Why wont my doctor take time to talk to me. I am so worried. please help me. He is increasing my synthroid to .175 .. 7 days a week instead of 5 days a week with 2 days being only a half a tablet. Its so confusing. :( Im just so upset. All the good doctors i had have retired or quit. I need some advice fast im so depressed and crying. Thank you Linda,2008,2008,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doctor; I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hosting this forum; I've posted once before and have found it very informative and helpful; thank you! I have a few questions concerning PVC's & PAC's. I have been evaluted by two different cardiologists with a battery of tests and everthing is normal; noted 1/2 apical ejection (flow) murmur only (28 year old male; 5' 11"; 190LBS; athletic). 1. From what I understand now; PVC's & PAC's are not harmful; is either worse than the other? ie. more PVC's 2. Is the sensation of a skipped beat the result of an extra beat or is the sensation from the extra flow of blood resulting from a longer pause in the heart rythm? 3. If an individual is experiencing for example 1;000 PAC's/PVC's on a daily basis; does that signify an extra 1;000 beats? Wouldn't these extra beats over a span of an average life "tire" the heart muscle? 4. I notice in my resting pulse only (around 48-52BPM) that sometimes after relaxing from either a work-out or just normal activity that a few beats are longer apart then others; however this is pattern is repeatitive; meaning the longer pause are not totally random but will repeat after the same number of beats per minute. My question is what's considered and irregular to regular pulse? 5. From your experience with past and present patients; have you seen any individuals experiencing PVC's/PAC's every go away entirely? 6. Are they the cause of some part of SA/NA node's deteriating? 7. Lastly on average; individuals with normal healthy hearts with benign PVC's/PAC's develop other serious conditions?,2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I was just released from a 4day detox from xanax's.The doctors in the center used valium to help with the withdrawl symptoms and I really felt pretty good throughout the 4 day stay.Well I have been home for 3 days and let me tell you...this is NO WALK IN THE PARK. I am very shaky; nervous and I have this very uncomfortable burning feeling in my legs and feet.Whats that about?????...I thought the worst was over. I without a doubt do not want to take a xanax ever again..I was never prescribed them; I just knew where to get them and never took over 3 purple ones a day; for a little over a year. I'm just wondering;;;when will i feel the least bit normal again. I understand that I didn't become addicted to them over night so I don't expect to feel 100% over night either; I'm just looking for some answers...could someone PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT!!!???THANKS,1999,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 40 year old female; generally healthy and have bicuspid aortic valve. My last echo; 2 yrs ago noted stage 1 regurgitation. For the last week; I have had an increase in palpitations. I have them all day long and they are especially bad at night. The exact minute I lay flat they start going crazy. I don't think it's a case of noticing them more because it's quiet; etc. They are really more frequent and stronger. I have to sit up in order to slow them down and still then they keep on coming. I have noticed that I have a lot more heartburn lately. I have been taking Nexium 40 mg twice daily for about 4 years and somedays I still have heartburn. I am being very careful of what I eat. I haven't had caffeine in about 5 years. I don't exercise because these palpitations scare the stuff out of me and I can't make myself go to the gym. I was told to do cardio and only very light weights if I was going to do any weights at all. I had a bad bout of palps around Christmas and went to the ER they ran an EKG and I had LOTS of PAC's and only about 4 PVC's. The palpitations that week kind of settled down to a bearable amount and then last week; that was it. It started all over again. It's like a big vibration and then a thump. I don't know what to do. Is there something new going on? Is there a special test I should get? I don't want to go on a beta blocker because my BP is low and my heartrate during palps is around 64. What do I do next? I am so scared.,2003,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping to get some help on this problem I have had for about 3 years. I get a strange feeling in my chest like I could feel each heart beat in my chest and it is very bothersome. My heart is not skiping although I do get that palpatations at times also;but this is more like energy jumping around in my chest. This is an all day thing I get for days at a time. Sometimes it gets alot worse after eating a meal. My heart will feel like it is racing but most times if I take my pulse it is 72BPM but it FEELS much faster. I have been for every heart test(Holter; 30 day monitor; stress test; echo) and the only thing they found was an elongated mitral valve and trace regurgitation which they tell me both are nothing; is this true?? or could that be causing these feelings? Also If I am sitting still watching TV my eyes seem to flicker along with each heart beat. I now this sounds wierd and I am hoping you may have heard of this before but it's like every time my heart beats my eyes pulse. My blood pressure is not high at all so I dont know why that happens. I am 31 female; not overweight; non-smoker. I also have days where I feel out of breath and a rapid pulse just from walking up a flight of stairs and the very next day I feel fine walking up the same stairs. I really need to know whats going on any ideas....thanks so much and have a Happy Thanksgiving Jean :),2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello all! Am I ever glad I found this site. I'm a newbie but definately not new to these dang pvc's. I was wondering if anyone else has what I call "positional pvc's"? By this I mean I can trigger them by lifting my right arm over my head; bending over; turning/twisting when only moving my upper chest; not turning my waist; reaching for things especially when reaching with my right arm over to the left side of my body. (Just seems to be my right arm) Even riding on a bumpy road can set them off which I think is very strange. Also with my last pregnancy; when the doc would have me lay on my back and she'd palpitate my belly it would set them off as well. Other things that trigger them are stretching while holding my breath; working on a burp that is stuck in my throat and talking without taking a breath. So basically anything can set them off! Just wondering if I'm the only weirdo here. If anyone else gets these "positional pvc's" please share.,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks to a doctor's answer to a previous post about my chest pain; my family dr. has diagnosed me with costochondritis and I am finally starting to feel better; however; in the past few weeks; I have begun to have some PVCs. Can stress cause PVCs to happen? My father died unexpectedly on Dec. 22 and both my brother and I have had episodes of PVCs (I am 31 and he is 29). I also had a baby 5 weeks before my father died; so I have been under some addition stress! We have never had PVCs before. The only reason I know that I'm having them is because my brother is a nurse and told me what they feel like. Both of us have had treadmill stress tests and I have had a Thallium stress test; which all came back normal. How do you cope with PVCs? Is there any deep breathing technique that can help with them? Is just de-stressing enough to make them go away? I usually have 1 every other day; but yesterday; I had 4; and I got a little worried. Thank you!,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Doctor; A few months ago while checking my pulse; I first noticed my heart skipping beats. This now happens regularly throughout the day. I never had this problem before. Are these also referred to as PVC's? What caused this to happen? Will these skipped beats go away? I started taking Zestril for high blood pressure right before these skipped beats started to occur. Did the Zestril do this to me? Could a blockage cause these skipped beats? Thank You....for your time.,2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I have horrible pvc's; bigeminy; trigeminy; supra ventricular contractions; and they happen to me everyday nonstop. I was referred to by my cardiologist to an electrophysiologist; and he refused to do the electro test on me. He said it was just stress. But; I still feel that it is stemming from the electrical system in my heart because I get it mainly after I eat; or if I move a certain way such as bending over. He suggested a beta blocker; and the first time I talked with him; he said if I could handle the pvc's then it would be best not to take it. But the 2nd visit; he said that I NEED to take it; because in the long run my heart will weaken because of them. Is this true? Because I bought my prescription of Coreg; and am terrified to take it; and I CAN deal with the pvc's as long as I know it's NOT gonna weaken my heart later. I am only 24.,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 35 yr old male in reasonably good health (Chol is little high at 230). I have had palpitations on and off for about 4 yrs; however; recently they have been worse. Most of my problems occur at night. Ususally right when I am falling to sleep; I sometimes wake up with a "startled" feeling; almost like my heart is beating too hard for me to go to sleep. Its a very uncomfortable feeling; but eventually I can fall asleep. However; recently; I was getting palpitations so bad (very strong beats); that I was awake all night. I went to my Drs and he put me on 25mg of Antelol. It didn't do much. He also had an EKG;ECHO;blood test; and Holter monitor which all came back normal. I am going to get an event monitor soon as well as see my Cardiologist who is booked up until Jan 29th. My biggest problem is that I get SOB not only when I feel my heart pounding during the night; but also during the day (my heart my be pounding as well; but I am less aware of it. Could anyone tell me what is causing this? Again; I don't necessarily think its the spead of my heartbeats; but the strength of them. The palpitations I can handle; but the shortness of breath is making me nervous. Thanks in advance!,2003,2003,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello there!!! I must say i have read; many articles sent by the forums users; and it has helped me through many troubled times!!! 4 & half years ago i was at work; and experianced a fluttering effect in my chest area; this totally freaked me out!! I went straight to ER and was realeased 1 hour later; the doctors said it was anxiety; i am a smoker so you can imagine when i got in the car; through the packet out and stopped smoking for 10 weeks; but picked the habbit up again; for about 6 months i could not figure out what was going on; i went to numerous doctors; but they said panic attacks; obvisously this didn't help me enough; i was getting this weird feelings in my chest; i finally went to a Cardiologist who is very renowed in the country; he did numerous tests eg.. stress;ekg; ultrasound; thallium and holter tests; he could only find that i was having pvc's and pacs; with bigemy and trigemny ; but my problem here is that i get another feeling which is not a pvc or pac; but what i noticed the other day was when i get this strange feeling is that my rythym would speeden up slightly for a few seconds; and go away ; my doctor says unless he can catch it on the ecg he can't pin point it; i have been on 50mg atenonol and 150 mg of avapro for 8 months now; i can't notice any pvc or pacs but still get this quicken beat which i can't figure it out what it is; i am 35 mildly over weight smoke half a pack of ciggarettes a day ; non drinker use to have hypertension ; overwise in very good shape; my question is would you have any idea what it could be??? and thank you!!!!!!!,2004,2004,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you so much for taking time to answer my quesitons.I am a female 31 years old no family history of heart disease non smoker 5'2" and now am 148 pounds (after losing 50 pounds.. I have been on WW). Well I have gone in SEVERAL times within the last year for heart palpitations and each time the Dr. says I am fine it is normal dont worry about it. But no ekg or anything they suggested see a mental health person to discuss stress. they did do a blood test and all is fine. they also took BP and it is 118/68. My pulse although elevated shortly after the episodes will drop right back down to my normal range 70-80 BPM. Well here is my dillemma. I went to a DR. outside of the Kaiser organization and he did an ekg that was normal and put me on a 24 hour monitor. Durning the 24 hour monitor I had a couple of episodes. during one episode the paramedics were called. Well the paramedics did an ekg and said they saw some premature beats. (the episode was over by then and i was in my "recovery" mode) This was something that the dr. did not see the day before when they did the ekg in the office. my ?? are as follows: can the 24 hr. holter indicate wether the "palpitations" are life threatening what is a premature beat and is this a point of major concen? One paramedic said that as i took slow deep breaths in my heart rate would go up then as i slowly exhaled it would go down. is this normal? Are there any other test that I should request to insure all bases are covered? Thank you again for all of your help. God Bless You Lisa,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question: I went in to the ER last week due to PVC's that have been with me for about 40 days now- I get a few hundred per day. I typically get them once every 3-4 months lasting a few days and then dissappear for another 3-6 months. All echo's; holters; stress tests- normal. I am 40; male; non smoker; non drinker; perfect weight. Why all of a sudden do we see a change in them ie: lasting longer than typical? I have been under stress lately ie: move; career etc ... My cardiologist says that they could go on for months or dissappear tommorow for months again. Question: 2- I am not a diabetic but I do notice that when my blood sugar is low I start getting PVC's almost instantly. Is this some coerrelation between PVC's and low blood sugar? Note: mom is type 2 diabetic Finally; I noticed on the blood results my cholesteral readings have come down: Total Chol- 214 down to 155 LDL - 118 down to 80 HDL - 43 same no change Trig - 26 up to 99 Blood sugar- 90 this after having eaten 3 hrs before blood was taken when at emerg. Why the sudden increase in trig? It almost seems that i reduced my LDL by more than 35% but the trig went up by almost the same percentage? STrange. Thanks for taking the questions?,2004,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,pvc's...are they all in my head? hello; for about 2 years now; i have been getting pvc's (skipped heartbeats)...the thing is; they are not constant; they would leave for a few months then are back again..is this a good sign that is not clogged arteries or heart related? i would figure if they were constant (everyday for months on end) then maybe could be something.i am a vegetarian and i do excercise; do not have caffeine..as far as the stress and anxiety goes; well thats another story..but i do take b-complex; co-enzyme q-10 and l-carnitine as well as postassium...the skipped beats seem to happen in the mornings basically; i dont feel them at all at night..my bpm at night is 15-17 beats per 15 seconds and during the day it is about the same; maybe 18 bpm. why is that when i brush my teeth or shower etc i can feel the skipped beats..the last time i had them were like 5 months ago..i think it could be all in my head..there are no symptoms with the pvc's; just the skipped beats which i can feel..thanks for you answers PVC'S,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 23 year old woman who has been having PVC's since I was 16 years old. I was only lucky enough to have them recorded and diagnosed as of last August 2005. I have had a echo; holter monitor; 2 stress tests; blood work and ekg; all results normal except for PVC's. I have elevated cholesterol since it is heridatary on my fathers side but it is just above borderline right now; I am thin and eat very healthy. I have had 4 spurts of unrecorded events that felt like PVC's and tachycardia together (hr at 180+ during the events). This has me concerned. Also I have lately found a coorelation of PVC's with exercise; though I can get them at any time during the day; it just seems to happen with exercise lately. I also tend to have chest pain that can be a sharp pain right in the apex area of the left side of my chest or hard in the centre and feels like it spreads to the right and left sides of my chest. I also get intense upper back pain. My questions are: 1.)should it be a concern to me about the pvc's on exercise so much lately? could a pvc at that rate stop my heart or somthing worse? 2.)What do you think of my chest pain? It can be pretty intense and last 5-10 mins other times it's only for a second. 3.)during the very fast hr spurts (not diagnosed) where it feels like my heart is just going crazy and it feels like pvc's at the same time; is this symptoms typical of those who end up with v-fib?What is happening if it is just "normal"? 4.)I have seen a cardiologist and I am wondering is it nessacary or important that I see an electrophysiologist? Thank You!!:),2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Again; I am still being plagued by these new sensations and feeling quite fed up with it all!I am getting an unusual palp sensation that feels like it grips me completely;it isn't a usual palp I can ignor;it comes on STRONG and forces me to listen.I had a bad palp yesterday that afterwards felt like someone was choking me and I had alot of pressure in my face.My face was hot and very flushed as too my arms and chest.It then passed.I am fearing I am having a very bad new arrhymia of some kind.I have tested normal on ecg;ekg;holter;bloodwork and stress test. Can I still be having a heart palp that is potientially fatal even after these good tests?Should I fear these new sensations?What should I do next?I went to the ER and had a 10 sec ekg that was good; but I also didn't feel anything unusual when it was on me.What do you infer about my situation?I am at the end of my rope and need some sort of explanation as to why I shouldn't fear dying from this.I am 23;female;normal weight & currently in councilling for my nervousness over this new sensation.I fear multiple pvcs and v-tach;since v-fib is a great rish at that point. HELP! Help me to understand my risks; what this may be(possibly;the chances that it is what I fear and why I should not fear dying from this. Thanks again for your time and I hope you can really give me some insight as to what to do next and what exactly is going on with my heart.I know you suggested anitarrhymics if pvcs effect my QOL. But if I can get past the stress; do I really need a drug like that?Wouldn't a beta-blocker be safer for me? Thanks again,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; well first i would just like to say a BIG THANKYOU from the bottom of my palpitating heart for this forum. I'am a 35yr mother of 3 (ages 4 - 3 - 11m) whom after the birth of my last child started down that long tiresome road we all seem to travel. Can i just say this; now that i know what i know about what seems to be going on with my heart and when i think back to THE DOOM DAYS as i call them was not the palpitation as such but the fear of what i thought was going to happen to me. And i think there would be a few of us out there who had there self (dare i say it) dead and buried !! Too many trips to doctors; trips in ambulances; ER departments the lists goes on but always leaving with what seems like no answers. However thankfully for me a chance meeting one night in the ER department with a wonderful doctor who arranged for me to see a great cardiologist that day of which neither fogged me off but instead gave me answers; which after all seems to be the best medicine of all. So in a nut shell i get palps; skips; flutters and my all time favorite svt; I don't know which one they are; pvc or pac or why i sometimes get svt i just know this i need to learn to live with them and not let them BE my life but accept that they are apart of my life; for how long who knows ?? Here are my questions; why do i sometimes get a flushed face and hands when having palp/svt. : finally; what damage can all these episodes do to my heart and am i at risks of having a HEART ATTACK ??,2007,2007,35,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Age 36/male. Had panic attacks/skipped beats @ 21; recently returned 6 months ago. Tests: nuclear stress test; echo; several ekg's; xray of chest and two 24hour halter monitors all in past 6 month's; all showed normal. The recent 24hour monitor captured my symptoms. Was told that they were 40 PAC's and 7 single point PVC's. PVC's are the one's I believe that happened during sexual arousal. Two cardiologists said it's harmless. The 24hour monitor recorded 4 PVC's this time during sexual activity. I had a couple of occasions of intense arousal where I had what I believe to be a run of these for a minute or two. I believe the symptoms were the same; just longer and it feels like: Skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; etc. for the whole minute or two. It feels as if it's locked in and will never return; then it does... Could this continue endlessly? I don't feel short of breath or anything. When the run happens; it feels like my heart rate slows; becomes steady and consistent also. Sometimes it will speed up a little afterward,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I read the article from Science Daily Feb. 08 and the articles on Hepatitis Central; Liver Foundation and Hepatitis Foundation International. They seem real positive about grapefruit. They also list a few drugs which can't be taken with grapefruit. Just came back from my doctor and he said I could have it. He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit! Going to be shot 17 tomorrow and feel good today! UND at 12 week and doc says I have a 60-65% chance of clearing. Thanks to all of you for helping to keep me positive. So; see what you think about grapefruit!!,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I came across the Article below on Liver International. Now I have never been a fan of Occult HepC. To me if it did exist there would be signs of it such as relapse during Chemotherapy or when otherwise immune suppressed. This doesn’t seem to occur that often if at all. So Occult HepC was never an issue for me. Might have to re-think that attitude after HCV was found in the kidney yet the patient was PCR neg and no hcv found in a biopsy sample. Classicly cured apart from the detecable HCV in his kidney. A somewhat intriguing article really. I never knew HCV had been detected in the kidneys of HCV+ people. As for being detected in someone who was HCV-; well not sure what to make of that. Other than I might owe DoubleDose an apology. Anyway here is the article Liver International 28 (6) ; 889–891 doi:10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01672.x Renal hepatitis C in the absence of detectable serum or hepatic virus Abstract We report an apparently unique case where hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was identified in renal tissue from a patient with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and treated chronic hepatitis C; despite the absence of detectable virus in the serum or liver (COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). The implications of this finding are discussed; with particular reference to current concepts regarding ‘occult’ hepatitis C infection. Case A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with lower-limb swelling and was found to have stigmata of chronic liver disease and abnormal liver biochemistry. Hepatitis C serology was positive; as was an ‘in-house’ serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (lower limit of detection; 50 IU/ml). Liver biopsy revealed features of established cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. His only known possible risk factor for HCV was a course of dental treatment in southeast Asia 30 years earlier. He was initially treated with two 12-month courses of interferon-α monotherapy with normalisation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and negativity for HCV RNA by the same ‘in-house’ assay. However; he became PCR positive 3 months after cessation of interferon therapy. Three years later he was given a 12-month course of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin with similar results (PCR negativity during treatment with relapse 3 months afterwards) and also started on treatment with atenolol for mild essential hypertension. Given the increasing evidence in support of maintenance interferon therapy; 2 years later he was given a further course of pegylated interferon–ribavirin combination therapy; with withdrawal of ribavirin after 6 months. Pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued over the next 3 years; during which he remained in good health (other than the occasional episode of gout treated with colchicine and allopurinol) and had a normal ALT and undetectable HCV RNA on repeated testing with the previously described assay. Baseline creatinine was normal and there were no documented episodes of renal impairment. He did; however; on one occasion; develop a rash on his lower legs; which was typical of that seen in cryoglobulinaemia. At this time he was found to be positive for serum HCV RNA and on further questioning explained that in the preceding month he had been injecting interferon that he had inadvertently left inside a hot automobile rather than stored in a refrigerator. Two weeks later he presented acutely with a 10-day history of general deterioration; abdominal and leg swelling and then development of a florid blistering erythematous rash over his lower limbs. Pertinent investigative findings included low serum albumin; raised serum creatinine; low C3 and C4 levels; positive urinary dipstick testing for blood; raised urinary protein at 1.5 g/24 h and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M κ band on cryoprecipitate and Ig electrophoresis. Hepatitis C IgG was positive while serum HCV RNA was undetectable on this and subsequent occasions using a COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay (Roche Diagnostics Limited; Burgess Hill; UK; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). A computed tomography scan of the chest; abdomen and pelvis showed features of cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites; but no lymphadenopathy. His remaining liver biochemistry and prothrombin time were normal. A liver biopsy (obtained via the transjugular route) was also negative for HCV RNA by the same PCR assay and histologically showed advanced cirrhosis with minimal interface hepatitis. Skin biopsy was consistent with bacterial cellulitis and this responded to ongoing treatment with intravenous antibiotics; leaving a residual (minimal) rash of purpuric appearance. Renal biopsy confirmed a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). PCR assay of renal tissue was positive for HCV RNA; in contrast to simultaneous serum and cryoprecipitate samples that were negative. The HCV genotype was not determined. In view of the diagnosis of HCV-associated cryoglobulinaemic MPGN; treatment with pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued and his condition slowly improved with normalisation of serum creatinine and albumin. Unfortunately; he was subsequently readmitted to the hospital with an episode of severe septicaemia and multiple organ failure secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; and died despite aggressive therapy including ventilatory and inotropic support.

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all; Sorry for the long 'history' - this is my first post on this board! : ) Been battling PVCs that I know of since 2007; suspected I've had them prior; but just didn't know what they were. Oh to be that ignorant again!! : ) Dx in 2007 from Cardio & EP was "benign; frequent PVCs" and that treatment would be worse than just living with them. So I went on my way; had some off & on; but this winter had a bunch & ended up in ER twice. New cardio did Holter; Stress Echo; Bubble test; 72 hr event monitor. Results were PVCs; PACs and a 4 beat run of NSVT. I have a floppy intraatrial septum; but no PFO & no aneurysm. Her recommendation was to take a low-dose BB (Bystolic); but since everything was structurally normal; to just do follow-ups every few years. Well; the whole thing got me on the anxiety "must find answers" treadmill; so had consult w/ original cardio & new EP in that old practice. Basically told me the same thing; no red flags; but EP said we "should" treat the PVCs bec. I have "so many". I do get a lot and I DO feel them. I mostly get them at rest; when my pulse is LOW; so 2 very short trials on BBs (atenolol & Bystolic) seemed to increase the PVCs which is NOT what I wanted. So EP was all "you should take Flecanide" and I said "go jump off a bridge"! If the PVCs are "benign" then WHY do I need treatment? I was having dizzy spells; so we did a TTT; which was "positive" for POTS; but EP didn't want to dx me with that until I ruled out other causes; like medication/blood sugar things. ???? I have other symptoms of dysautonomia; so I'm still not sure that's not a component of the whole PVC thing. SO - today had 3rd EP consultation - where he said looking at my EKG; the PVCs seem to originate in the RVOT; which can be amenable to ablation; but sometimes only a 50/50 chance of complete success. He also mentioned Flecanide or Rhythmol - bec. I have a "healthy heart" the dangers aren't there that people think. I asked what is the danger of NOT treating it and he said "there is none; you're basically treating a symptom and when the symptom becomes too much to handle; we'll treat it". Seriously? I'm not sure who else knows where there PVCs come from - and can you really tell just from an EKG? and is this really NOT life-threatening? He kept saying they were not - they wouldn't cause me to drop dead; which is the reason I'd seek treatment. Yes; they drive me crazy some days; but if it's really & truly NOT dangerous; why would I want to mess around w/ a strong anti-arrhytmic med and/or an ablation? I am exhausted by all of this - worrying about the PVCs; worrying they are missing something; worrying they are "different today" & I need to go back to the Drs.; wondering if there is some other underlying cause that can be 'fixed'?? My husband thinks I need a moratorium on even thinking about these things & just go back for annual cardio visits; but I'm so freaked about missing a "new symptom" that may change my diagnosis; I can't stop researching. I am seeing a counselor for the anxiety; just in case you were wondering! : ) These things really do make me crazy; but I'm not crazy enough to do the meds or ablation. Yet. Thanks for any thoughts; input; etc. Colleen,2008,2010,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I would like to say how much I admire your willingness to take time out of your day to answer questions. I can say how grateful I am to have this outlet.I have gained much insight.My fear is still there but it helps to know I am not alone. I have panic disorder& I had a terrible bout of pac's pvc's after a day of dehydration.exhertion. I am deconditioned but am active and losing steadily. I am 28 years old;do not drink;no drugs;never ever coffee have not drank soda since 1987;no chocolate.Mother of 5. have had numerous ekgs;countless blood tests;my numbers are 160& 71 & the doc says I need to get my one number down.My fatty blood tests have been 200- 230 since age18. I am currently battling a bout of bronchitis; 2 weeks which I think is caused from allergies/gerd. questions? can improper sleeping/anxiety cause muscle smasms in the left chest above the breast?I get scared because it feels like my heart when in good sense I know its muscular? Can bronchitis cause&increase in pvc's when you are not rested&even though I am staying very hydrated I am just not hungry/ am afraid to eat for fear of triggering skips. I notice more pvc's when I have eaten a banana-conincidence or something more?What causes muscle spasms in the chest(never no pain just see the skin)? Is it possible that I have had pvc's for most of my life&not know until I became hypervigilant to my body? My holter recorded more pac's then pvc's. any signifigance? why do I get chest pains when I have gas;belching? one day I ate barley;broccoli;salmon&20 mins I was in pain&loose stools;then ok,2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and paroxymal hypertension in my twenties. I've always felt skipped beats to some degree. About three years ago I had onset of paroxymal atrial fibrillation; this was diagnosed in the emergency room. My heart rate was 153 bpm and irregular. I've had about twelve bouts of this atrial fibrillation since this time. It does seem to be triggered by stress; but no one can figure out the cause. Echos show a mild mitral valve prolapse; that's all. I started having many skipped beats around October last year. I went to the doctor; who put a holter monitor on. It showed approximately 680 skipped beats in the 24 hour period. She diagnosed this as PSVT. I then followed up with my cardiologist who did a thallium stress test; which revealed all was normal. He then put a holter monitor on last week. The computer print out said I had 1;127 narrow beats within the 24 hour period. I believe that; as my diary showed almost constant skipped beats. My cardiologist told me I was imagining them; that I had only truly had 14 skipped beats; and that the computer errored.He feels it's my esophagus causing this. If it was my esophagus; why would I feel skips in my pulse? Does any of this sound dangerous to you? I am currently on tenormin 25mg t.i.d. It doesn't seem to help this PSVT from occuring. The only two things I know is they are worse at period time; and they are worse depending on how I move (bending over can cause them to start) and once they start sometimes they just won't quit for awhile. Is there a cure for all of this? I am also wondering if these "narrow beats" which he also referred to as PAC's are to do with the atrium and maybe my heart is trying to convert into a-fib full time rather than paroxymal? Any info you can give me is much appreciated. Thanks.,2001,2001,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying "well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this. I mean; I feel like i try to do everything right...I eat fairly well; I'm definitely not overweight; dont smoke or drink; somewhat active...the only thing I have trouble with is my anxiety. Ugh...this is frustrating!,2008,2008,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a healthy 37 year old woman; who went through surgical menopause two years ago. [Other than many repeated viral illnesses in the past six months] I am at an ideal body weight; I exercise 3-4 times weekly; and I don't smoke. I take Premarin and progesterone daily. This past winter; after suffering a fairly severe flu; I began to experience what has been diagnosed as inappropriate sinus tachycardia for the first time. For the 37 years prior; I never had any cardio issues whatsoever. Then I suddenly began to experience unexplained bouts of rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. At first my symptoms abated when I increased my estrogen replacement; only to return again in a more severe form about two months later. I began to have bouts of rapid heart beat and "skipped beats" daily from about 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. -- bothersome enough to prevent me from being able to do anything; with a BP of about 150/95 during these episodes. Advice to just ignore it really wasn't helpful -- I was too short of breath during the episodes to be able to really function. Chance in diet; relaxing; completely avoiding caffeine; alcohol; etc. made no real difference. I have run the gamut of tests; holter monitor; echocardiogram; stress tests; VQ scan; blood work; pheo testing -- all has come back normal. Event monitors captured my rapid beats and premature beats. Now I am taking 25mg of Toprol each day; which seems to really help; although I still feel the side effects a bit -- sleepiness; etc. Two questions: 1. Does anyone have any idea as to what causes this condition to begin in the first place? I'm very frustrated by suggestions that it "must be stress" in the absence of an obvious physical cause. I know myself well; and stress is not the answer; nor is caffiene; alcohol; etc. Could a virus have triggered this? If so; is this type of condition generally life long; or time limited? I somehow feel either hormones or a virus must be the underlying culprit. My doctors seem more interested in just treating the symptoms and not getting to the cause; and I haven't been able to find any info on origins of inappropriate sinus tachydardia. 2. My cardiologist advised me to continue to exercise as much as possible. When beta blockers slow the heart rate; does that bar the aerobic benefits of exercise? Thank you so much! Julie,1999,2000,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I would like to know why it is during activity as simple as walking up the stairs makes pvc's and pac's more noticable? Can you reccomend any books that deal with panic/pvc's.. I have had panic disorder many years...fast heart rate was a common complaint but in all my years I never noticed the skipping til one day I was ehausted and dehydrated.. I am getting better and have learned to ingore them..I still do tend to notice them after excercise. I have just come to the conclusion I have probably had them but neve noticed them before. I am managing panic/pvc's without medication but it is so hard when your heart is racing close to 160 bpm...(I did use xanax for 6 months but do not liek the way it makes me feel fater use but did help the panic) usually it is brought on by hypervigilance or misinterpretting normal body sensations.. I have had echo;ekg holter and all tell I have healthy heart...my bp is wonderful(110/65)normal resting pulse is around 75 and I am 28 year old female... my bp does go up (160/100) but quickly recovers but my pulse takes longer to come down...is that typical....? I just wanted to hear if you have any experience/theories on panic/pvc's and is it normal to feel more aware of pac's after/during excercise? my pcd keeps pushing paxil and tells me I am doing this to myself.... thank you for taking the time...,2001,2002,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 35 year old; 145 lb. woman with two small children. No known health issues; generally pretty healthy. B/P usually 120/70. Ever since I had my first daughter; I have had episodes of what they tell me are pvc's and pac's. I will be standing making dinner; or sitting with my children and it will feel like this heavy sinking feeling in my chest (almost throat) area. For the most part; it is quick; and if I brace for literally a few seconds; it's over. Since this past August; I have had 5 different episodes where it feels as though it is fluttering and my rythym does not reset immediately; the longest one lasting close to 6 minutes. It is a very strange feeling which starts like the sinking feeling I get from the premature beats but doesn't stop. It is difficult to catch my breath during the episode and it is very frightening. I am not an anxious person; and am generally able to stand and ride it out; but there are times where it feels like it will not reset and it can make me a little nervous. Only once; it made me very dizzy and short of breath; but that lasted less than 30 seconds. I wore an event monitor for 30 days; where they were able to record the PVC; PAC activity. I was also told that I was having a supraventricular tachycardia. I am told by my cardiologist that she is "very confident" that it is nothing to worry about. I had an echo/stress test and blood work and was thankfully told my heart is just fine; but these episodes are quite scary. What is a svt and can this really all be nothing to worry about? Should I get a second opinion? Thank you!,2004,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone! I’m female; about 120 lbs; 5.4” tall. I’ve had Syncope and pre-syncope since my early 20’s and I’m 35 yrs old now. I’ve had 4-5 of these/year but this year I’ve already had 4 pre-syncopes and one full blown Syncope. During these episodes I have: Extreme nausea; palpitations; ringing/ buzz like sound in my ears and then no sound at all; feel hot and sweaty and then cold after it passes;etc..I usually know I’m going to faint because of these symptoms but I have also fainted sometimes with no previous warning or presyncope. I’ve also had 2 episodes of very severe palpitations which lasted for 15-20 min just after I had started mild exercise ( Felt as if my heart was in my throat). I have never taken this very seriously until recently because I’ve been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia for pain in my back and arms and I started swimming as recommended by my Rheumatologist but now I’m scared to get into the pool. On a daily basis; I feel extremely fatigued; dizzy; dis-oriented; sometimes short of breath after even slight activity. I have been recording my vitals recently. I have low normal BP of 90-100/60-70; Heart rate while sitting is in 80s and on standing is from upper 90s to sometimes in 120s. My Cardiologist said that I might have Neuro=cardiogenic Syncope but I had a negative tilt-table test result and normal Echo and Stress tests. So; now he is suggesting an implantable loop recorder since my syncope is so infrequent but I got scared and asked for a 30 day event monitor instead. He has also referred me to a EP Cardiologist. Now; I’m having second thoughts and thinking of getting the Implantable loop recorder instead of a 30 day event monitor as I’m really desperate to find out what is wrong with me and just want to have a normal life and not worry constantly about fainting as I live alone. I’m really confused and would highly appreciate any input/suggestions on where to go from here.,2012,2012,,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 26. At the end of February I have started to feel some singular; strong heart beats every day. The feeling was that as if I had forgotten to breathe for a second; then had take one deep breath and then those heart beats were comming with a feeling of anxiety and scare. I have decided to go to a specialist with those symptoms. I got reffered to blood test (morphology); holter ecg 24 monitor; 24 h blood pressure monitor and hearts echocardiography. The blood test was ok - I have got a bit too high level of sodium (146 mmol/l with max of 145 mmol/l). The 24 hour blood pressure monitor showed small hypertension (my average day result was 141/81 when standard should be 135/85; and my averagenight result 129/69 when a norm is 120/70). My echocardiography was ok; it didn't show anything; which could have influence on the hearts rythm; the anatomy was correct. And there it comes to 24 hour holter ecg monitor... It has caught nsVT episode with 11 beats with fastest V-Tach 161 bpm - at 8:25. The whole VENTRICULAR ECTOPY statystics are shown below: All VE: 118 VE Pairs: 0 V-Tach: 1 Longest V-Tach: 11 beats at 20:25 Fastest V-Tach: 161 bpm at 20:25 Slowest V-tach: N/A VE`s per 1000/per hour: 2/6 VE total : 118 V-Pair total : 0 V-Run total (V-Tach) : 1 Longest V-Run (V-Tach) : 11 beats at 20:25 Max HR V-Run (V-Tach): 161 bpm at 20:25 Min HR V-Run (V-Tach): N/A VE's per 1000/per hour : 2/6 Ventricular R on T : N/A And the rest: HEART RATE Min HR : 46 bpm at 8:06 Max HR : 135 bpm at 8:59 Avg HR 24 hours : 87 bpm Min HR hourly : 70 bpm at 4:00 Max HR hourly : 105 bpm at 9:00 Analyzed beat : 116365 SUPRAVENTRICULAR ECTOPY SVE total : 0 SV-Run Total : 0 Longest SV-Run : N/A Max HR SV-Run : N/A SVE's per 1000/ hour : 0/1 Total aberrant beats : 0 Atrial Fib/flutter : 0.0% ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS Total ST Minutes Ch.1 : 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.2: 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.3 : 0 Max delta ST depression : N/A Max delta elevation : N/A Max ST episode : N/A Max HR in ST episode : 0 First; I need to confess; that I am really scared after speaking with my cardiologist; when she had seen the results of my 24 h holter monitor examination - the point of her(and; from now on; mine especially) concern is V-Tach noticed on 20:25. She told me; that it is a very dangerous type of arrhythmia which can cause fainting or even death. I need to tell you that I am true valetudinarian - I tend to analyze the worst possible scenarios when I feel any ailment and to be worried about it. So when I have seen the concern of my cardiologist I don't need to describe you; what influence on me it has... I have been prescribed betaloc 50 mg once a day; and 2 magnesium 500 mg pills twice a day. One important thing: on January and March I have got some serious issues on personal nature which was a really stressful time for me (in fact it is still); this combined with difficult situation in my job made me feel really bad at that time - I have got holter examination then so I suppose that it could have an influence on its results. Now with one more problem - being so worried about my health; I am totally down:/ What concerns me the most... is this episode of V-Tach really so serious? Am I in danger of loosing consciousness in every moment; or even have sudden cardiac death? Is it really something bad with my body; heart; psychology; my mind; so in case of stressful situations I have described; it ends with nsVT like the one caught during holter examination? I am not sure if my cardiologist did well by prescribing me strong heart medicine stright away; and frigtening me with possible serious consequences of my illness (I have been told that I am ill). When I was coming back home after this visit; suddenly I felt very fast hart beating with a feeling like my hart would jumped in into my stomach; I was in panic; for the seconds I was sure it is the end... After couple of minutes everything was back in normal. Now I know it was a panic disorder - first one in my life. I don't think it was accidence that it happen after seeing with my doctor ... I wouldbe grateful for help with analyzing my results and telling me a bit more about nsVT episodes regarding to young people; without earlier heart issues. PS. Sorry for some spelling mistakes - english is not my native language; but I tried to do my best so you can understand all from what I wanted to say.,2013,2013,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Patient is 48 year old Cambodian female w/ family hx hypertension and autoimmune disorders (multiple drug/food allergies; IgM nephropathy; asthma). Prior hx: 1) post-traumatic seizure disorder; well controlled on gabapentin1200 mg daily 2) hypothyroidism; euthyroid on 100mcg synthroid daily. Onset was after commencing gabapentin; ? secondary to the drug? 3) hypertension; generally well controlled on irbesartan 300mg daily but exacerbates emotionally stressed Management of the above has been greatly complicated by allergic reactions to: dilantin; phenobarbital; valproic acid; ACE inhibitors; atenolol; thiazide diuretics. Excepting valproic acid; all these reactions occurred 2-4 weeks after exposure with rash; urticaria; photophobia; malaise. s. Reaction to valproic acid occurred almost 2 years after initiating therapy and was of Stevens-Johnson type. 1 year ago for gradual onset on neck and shoulder pain radiating down the arms; and numbness in the hand. MRI showed nerve root compression at C5-7. EMG showed median nerve compression. She was treated with physiotherapy and with NSAIDs but latter had to be stopped after allergic reaction. Carpal tunnel release in June 2004 resolved numbness of hand but stiffness and pain at wrist and fingers con tinued & progressed to generalized polyarthralgias; impairing ADLs. 6 months ago; a rheumatologist dx'd RA based on clinical exam & elevated ESR. Placed on ASA and hydrochloroquine with initial e improvement in joint pain but allergic reaction required discontinuation . Switched to methotrexate. Joint pain did not improve and about 3-4 weeks into treatment she had another allergic reaction; this one of Stevens-Johnson type and very severe. Next placed on SSZ;t pain improved allergic reaction (rash/urticaria) required discontinuation. A second rheumatologist/immunologist conducted more comprehensive exam including hand/wrist xrays; ANA; rheumatoid factor; C-reactive protein etc. All tests negative except for ESR which was elevated. Hand/wrist films showed only mild osteoarthritic changes disproportional to the amount of pain and functional impairment. He dx'd serum sickness rather than RA and rx'd prednisolone 30mg/day tapering down to 10mg. Now 3 months later; prednisolone is 10 mg daily and joint pain continues to severely limit ADLs. Severity flunctuates but pain never completely absent. She has had 2 mild allergic reactions to drugs during this period. Every effort is made to avoid new drug exposures but unfortunately her other medical problems sometimes result in hospital or doctor visits where; despite being provided with the history; new drugs and/or drugs she is known to be allergic to (e.g. NSAIDs) are given. Q: How likely that arthralgia due to past drug reactions? If so; what is long term prognosis? Suggestions on management? Could it instead be a adverse effect gabapentin or irbesartan? If so; what to do given allergy to most alternatives,2005,2005,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement.

Atenolol+hypertension,I started again to have these feelings of skipped heart beats beginning on 7/23. Sometimes maybe 2 per minute but may go as high as 10 per minute. The come and go during the day which is very frustrating. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Paxil CR for anxiety for about two years now. I haven't had any issues with these skipped beats since 3/03. Then all of a sudden they return. In March I went to see a cardiologist I met during my anxiety issues and he assured me that my heart was in great shape and these skipped beats can re-surface and disappear just like that. In 2000 I developed anxiety symptoms and was treated for them. I had numerous tests at a cardiologist's offce during this time since some of my anxiety symptoms were causing what I thought were heart issues. I had a stress echo in 9/99 and a cardiolite stress test in 6/01. All negative. Twenty-one day event monitor; X-rays and numerous blood tests along with re-visits to a cardiologist since 2000. I am an avid cyclist and tennis player three times a week. I drink coffee in the morning but it is a light caffeine version. Alcohol on the weekends and sometimes during the week with neighbors. I am not overweight and watch what I eat. Giving you all this backgound; why do these skipped hearts beats keep coming and going. They create a very uncomfortable; anxious feeling when they happen and I am quite sure they feed my anxiety. Can I do anything about them. Are they serious? Do you have any advice or should I expect to live with them.,2003,2003,,

Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for your response to my CURIOUS TACHYCARDIA of Nov.11; 1998. You mentioned in your response additional tests that should be taken. I apologize for not giving that data initially: I was trying to keep the inquiry short and I felt (mistakenly so) that the symptoms were explicit enough to warrant additional comments. Specifically; I have had a 24 hour Holter monitor which showed several bursts of tachycardia during the day. My blood chemistry (several tests) is normal including the potassium levels. Thyroid function is normal. Other tests for the hypertension show no renal artery stenosis and no pheochromocytoma on the kidneys. The echogram shows my carotids are clear. The carotid sinus massage and the Valsalva maneuver are discussed in Harrison's INTERNAL MEDICINE. Reading up on the various forms of tachycardia there seem to be two candidates: sinus tachycardia due to bouts of hypotension or volume depletion and paroxysmal supraventicular tachycardia. The sinus tachycardia seems a poor candidate since it is chracterized in some of the material I have read as having a slow and gradual response to the carotid sinus massage; whereas my own experience was an immediate cessation once the massage was applied. That would leave the PSVT which has a fast response to the massage but seems to have many origins. If this material clarifies the situation; I would deeply appreciate you opinions on the following: 1. Does it seem that this could be one of the tachycardias that can be fatal at times? 2. With this additional data; can you express an opinion as to the most likely form of tachycardia? 3. Since I am under heavy medication; could my condition be due to interaction between several of the drugs? My present doctor is a cardiologist and he seems puzzled by these symptoms. Thank you for your help. George. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear George; Thank you for your question. There are many causes of tachycardia (fast heart beat) and they can be divided roughly into sinus (originating from the sinus node or heart's natural pacemaker) and non-sinus tachycardias. Nonsinus tachycardias are either supraventricular (coming from the upper chambers of the heart) or ventricular (coming from the lower chambers of the heart). Supraventricular tachycardias include: paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; atrial flutter; atrial fibrillation and AV nodal tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardias are more serious in nature and are due to a rapid depolarization of the ventricles. Sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate of greater than 100 beats per minute originating from the sinus node. Sinus tachycardia is classified as either appropriate or inappropriate. There are many causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia such as exercise; anxiety; panic attacks; dehydration; deconditioning; volume loss due to bleeding or other loss of body fluids; hyperthyroidism; electrolyte abnormalities and many other conditions. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia can only be diagnosed when all causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia have been ruled out. It is not clear what causes inappropriate sinus tachycardia but possible etiologies are an increase in the rate at which the sinus node depolarizes and an increased sensitivity to adrenaline. Once the diagnosis has been made by ruling out all of the potential causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia there are several treatment options. If the symptoms are not overly concerning no treatment needs to be done. There is no increase in morbidity or mortality in persons with this condition and they can expect to have a normal life-span. For persons in whom the symptoms are unbearable medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used; usually with good results. In the rare person unable to tolerate medical treatment catheter ablation (burning) of the sinus node with insertion of a pacemaker or surgical removal of the sinus node have been used in the past. Newer techniques are being developed using catheter ablation to modify and not destroy the sinus node thus avoiding the need for a pacemaker. This procedure is still in it's infancy and should only be undertaken at a major medical center after consultation with an electrophysiologist. Below are some journal articles that address this topic in depth. Your local medical library should be able to help you find copies. Review Articles: Krahn AD. Yee R. Klein GJ. Morillo C. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: evaluation and therapy. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology. 6(12):1124-8; 1995 Dec. Abstract Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is an ill-defined clinical syndrome characterized by an increased resting heart rate accompanied by an exaggerated response to exercise or stress. It is not associated with underlying structural heart disease. The mechanism may involve a primary abnormality of the sinus node demonstrating enhanced automaticity or; alternatively; a primary autonomic disturbance with increase sympathetic activity and enhanced sinus node beta-adrenergic sensitivity. The diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is one of exclusion. It is most common in young females; with a disproportionate number employed in the health care field. Autonomic and electrophysiologic testing may be required in selected individuals to clarify the mechanism and rule out sinus node reentry or right atrial tachycardia. Therapy of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is empiric. Pharmacologic approaches include beta blockers or verapamil. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the superior portion of the sinus node shows promise as a useful alternative in patients with refractory symptoms. Sims JM. Miracle V. Sinus tachycardia. Nursing. 26(6):49; 1996 Jun. Articles Concerning Catheter Treatment Options. Lee RJ. Kalman JM. Fitzpatrick AP. Epstein LM. Fisher WG. Olgin JE. Lesh MD. Scheinman MM. Radiofrequency catheter modification of the sinus node for "inappropriate" sinus tachycardia. Circulation. 92(10):2919-28; 1995 Nov 15. BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias refractory to medical therapy. However; in symptomatic patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia resistant to drug therapy; catheter ablation of the His' bundle with permanent pacemaker insertion is currently applied. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency modification of the sinus node as alternative therapy for patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with disabling episodes of inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to drug therapy (4.2 +/- 0.3 drug trials) underwent either total sinus node ablation or sinus node modification. The region of the sinus node was identified as the region of earliest atrial activation in sinus rhythm during electrophysiological study. This region was further defined by use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in 9 patients; in whom it was found that an ablation catheter could be guided reliably and maintained on the crista terminalis. Radiofrequency energy was delivered during tachycardia between either a standard 4-mm or custom 10-mm thermistor-imbedded catheter tip and a skin patch. Total sinus node ablation was performed successfully in all 4 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a junctional escape rhythm. Sinus node modification was successfully achieved in all 12 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a 25% reduction in the sinus heart rate. For the group as a whole; exercise stress testing after ablation revealed a gradual chronotropic response; with a significant reduction in maximal heart rate (132.8 +/- 6.5 versus 179.5 +/- 3.6 beats per minute [bpm]; P < .001) without evidence of an exaggerated heart rate response to a light workload (103.0 +/- 4.1 versus 139.5 +/- 3.5 bpm; P < .001). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring revealed a significant decrease in maximal heart rate and mean heart rate after ablation (167.2 +/- 2.6 versus 96.7 +/- 5.0 bpm; P < .001; and 125.6 +/- 5.0 versus 54.1 +/- 5.3 bpm; P < .001; respectively). There was a significant decrease in the number of applications of radiofrequency energy required in patients undergoing modification of the sinus node when guided by ICE compared with fluoroscopy alone (3.6 +/- 0.8 versus 10.4 +/- 2.1; P < .01) as well as a decrease in fluoroscopy time (33.0 +/- 9.5 versus 58.5 +/- 8.4 minutes). After a mean follow-up period of 20.5 +/- 0.3 months; there were no recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent a total sinus node ablation. However; 2 patients who had a total sinus node ablation subsequently required permanent pacing because of symptomatic pauses; and 1 patient developed an ectopic atrial tachycardia. After a mean follow-up of 7.1 +/- 1.7 months; there were two recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent sinus node modification. However; no significant bradycardia or pauses were observed. Complications encountered during the study included 1 patient who developed transient right diaphragmatic paralysis and another patient who developed transient superior vena cava syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus node modification is feasible in humans and should be considered as an alternative to complete atrioventricular junctional ablation for patients with disabling inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to medical management. Sinus node modification may be aided by ICE. Jayaprakash S. Sparks PB. Vohra J. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST): management by radiofrequency modification of sinus node. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Medicine. 27(4):391-7; 1997 Aug. BACKGROUND: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a rare form of supraventricular arrhythmia. It can cause disabling symptoms and may be refractory to medical treatment. In symptomatic drug refractory patients; sinus node excision or total ablation of the sinus node with permanent pacemaker implantation was the only therapeutic option. Recently; radiofrequency (RF) modification of the sinus node has been reported to be an effective treatment for this condition. AIM: To present our experience with sinus node modification using RF energy in the management of IST. METHODS: Between 1989 to 1996 three patients (two females and one male); aged 28-36 years were diagnosed with symptomatic IST. All had failed multiple drugs and hence underwent sinus node modification using RF. In the first two patients; the site of RF application was guided by anatomical landmarks using fluoroscopy to localise the presumed most superior portion of the crista terminalis and also the earliest site of atrial activation. In the third patient; a 20 pole electrode catheter was used to map the crista terminalis and guide the ablation. Success was defined by 20-30% reduction in the heart rate with normal atrial activation sequence after ablation. RESULTS: The three patients described here had IST by clinical; electrocardiographic and electrophysiological criteria and were refractory to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs. The number of RF applications were 11; 15; and three applied at the site of earliest atrial activation for the control of heart rates. Patient 3 had a early recurrence at one month and underwent repeat sinus node modification (five RF applications). All three patients who underwent RF modification of the sinus node had a successful outcome. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patients remain asymptomatic during follow up (20; 12 and three months) with satisfactory control of heart rate; although one patient requires atenolol which was previously ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: RF modification of the sinus node is feasible and effective for IST; and should be the treatment of choice in patients refractory to medical therapy.

Atenolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called "overdrive suppression". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights! Can't sleep :( Erik,2010,2010,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 yr. old healthy female; 5'3 120lbs. exercise everyday. I've been getting heart palpitations for years. Recently they've been coming more frequently but mostly only when I sit or lay down. I do have an underactive thyroid and yes my levels were way off which can cause them; but why only when I sit or lay down they affect me. Any insight to this...,2006,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Last night I had a vibration thing happen in my chest off and on for about 2 hours. I am almost positive that my pulse was normal just fast (100-110). It was scary but I didn't panic and my breathing stayed normal. I have had a panic attack before (full on heart attack thinking kind) and this wasn't like that. I was just wondering if the heart can be spasming and yet not be arrythmic. Does that make sense? Is an anxiety attack and a panic attack the same thing? (I did post on the anxiety forum too; I just feel like it is a heart related issue so I thought I'd try it here too!!) I have mentioned that I am heading to Mayo and I would like to go up there with only the relevant chest related issues and although I FEEL like last night was one; I really honestly don't know anymore. Thanks you all and I hope you have a great weekend.,2006,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Had a stent placed in L main coronary artery (95% blockage) 2 months ago. Prior to the stent I had been extremely athletic. Even after coronary ischemic attacks which began just before the angioplasty; I passed stress test with flying colors. After the blockage was discovered thanks to a persistent PCP; and the stent inserted; I had chest pain afterwards. Was re-catheterized; all the major arteries were given a clean bill of health; but was placed on a beta blocker. Terrible reaction to the first one; put on a second one; and finally my cardiologist took me off that one as well. Although I see some improvement; I still have chest "aches" on exertion. All on the left side; below the heart;; in the side; sometimes in the back of the shoulder; and above the breast. Can not walk at a normal pace. Walk very slowly to control the pain. Cardiologist suggested cardio rehab which will begin in a few weeks. But have not heard of anyone else with such symptoms. Don't know if I should risk walkin through the pain; or if it is a symptom that should be further pursued; and or tested. All of my blood work; tests have come back normal so far. Should I be concerned?,2008,2008,52,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I get these unexplained chills all the time; where im freezing cold with goose bumps all over my body. They hurt and I can barely walk they are so bad sometimes. I check my temp when I get these episodes and its perfectly normal. I do not have a infection or am not sick. Im not even in a cold environment. Everyone around me is not cold. Its the weirdest thing; and I cant find a answer for it. Its like my body is messed up and sending these chills for no reason. Please help.,2008,2008,20,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Does anyone know why bending over at the waist brings on PACs or PVCs? Seems like almost every time I bend over to pick up something off the floor I get a burst of PACs when I stand up. It is freaking me out. Also happens if I sit or lay down too quickly. Please help.,2006,2006,34,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello*** I was wondering if anyone could provide me a little information and possibly some relief to the problem I am experiencing right now. Every night for the past week or so; when I try to fall asleep; my heart rate accelerates tremendously and pounds like crazy. Normally I never have any trouble falling asleep so this is becoming somewhat of an annoyance because I actually FEEL sleepy but because my heart beats so fast and so hard it keeps me awake. I can feel it throughtout my body and it lasts for hours. I try so hard to fall asleep that I have come up with little tricks to kind of "pych myself out". Like I try rolling over in different positions trying to offset the rhythm so hopefully when it starts again it will be normal. I try to clear my mind totally. After a while I will doze off; (without me knowing but I'm not complaining) but I'll wake like 45 min later only to realize that my heart is still beating as hard as ever. If I get really annoyed I'll try to stand up; walk around or go for a drink of water. But nothing helps. And I'm so sleepy. As soon as I settle back in it starts again. I have had anxiety issues in the past but I think what made it worse for me is that at first I didn't know what it was. Then once I became more aware of what an actual "anxiety attack" was it just kind of went away on its own. And I do admit I was dealing with a whole lot at the time. But now; on the contrary; there has been no extreme changes in my life or anything I would say I am really stressed or worried over; @ night all I pretty much want to do is sleep and I can't. It's coming to the point now that I am almost expecting my "nightly episodes"; like I'm looking for it to start. And this is an obsession (an unhealthy one at that) that I don't care to have! The way my heart beats it feels like to me that it is pumping way too much blood throughout my body for too long of a time; my heart might burst; or I may die in my sleep. Its poisoning my thoughts and I wish I knew what to do to make it stop. I'm afraid. Please help.,2009,2009,,Female

Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this "discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out." I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel "normal" again. Thank you for your response!,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 53 year old female; non-smoker and have no weight problems; and no known health problems. Over the past two years; I've had numerous episodes where my body takes involuntary deep breaths; one every 7-8 minutes; interspersed with my normal breathing. The intake of breath can be when inhaling or exhaling; and it when it occurs; it disrupts a normal breath. Often the involuntary breath feels "catchy" as if I'd been crying or sobbing when in fact I have not. When the involuntary breaths first started; Sometimes I would go for 3 months without an episode; but then it would come back again; last for a few weeks and go away again. Within the past 4 months; I had a horrible cold; and then a bad case of bronchitis. The involuntary breathing has started up with the cold; and it is now contiunous; every 7 to 10 minutes or so. I recently had an upper endoscopy; and finished a regiment for h pylori bacteria; however this annoying problem remains. Is it possible this could be related to stess? I've mentioned it to my doctor; and she doesn't seem to be concerned about it; Unfortunately; it is of concern to me; and I have no idea what might be causing it. Any assistance that can be provided would be greatly appreciated.,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,A week ago I had a Tia. I was unable to speak and could not move my left arm or leg. This went on for about an hour and 15 mins. After a night in the hospital; and an Mri and other scans. I was released. I was told I should have no side effects. But now I have bad head aches on my left temple and I get a stabbing pain on my temple and neck; that last that last just several seconds. Also my speach has been effected slightly. Often I will be talking and a word will pop in a sentence where it doesnt belong; and I forget just what I want to say. Could you tell me how long these symptons last? Thank you jjjtll,2007,2007,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!,2009,2009,34,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,I saw another post about atrial fibrillation and stomach gas possible association or connection. I too have the same thing so it may not be all in your head if your suspect this to be the case. Most dr.'s think your crazy or never heard of this when you even suggest it. Thats whats wrong with most dr's atleast in my experience in that they don't think outside the box enough possibly because this is what they learned. I think I/we can guess or prognose just as well or better than they can at times particularly if we know something about health and or ourselves and our own health. Never be afraid to speak up because I feel strongly that digestive tract problems are real and translate into other real nasty symptoms like this. Fortunately we can prevent much of this & need to prevent it from happening. I do feel the more you get afib the worse it can become either physically; emmotionally or both no matter what the cause. I thought up until now that I may have been the first to discover this but would like to know if anyone else has any real answers to this as being a connection? I would like to know how many people feel that they get atrial fibrillation and feel that it may be related to gas or full; bloated stomach; intestinal or digestive tract troubles etc? Isn't it possible that the gas; bloat; perhaps inflamed digestive or intestinal tract can disturb the vagus nerve thereby possibly causing you to go into an afib attack? Any real dr's out there any more with some real info about this? Even conjecture? Any way I also would be interested in what anyone might have to say about it and or what they may have learned from this? If you know or even think this to be the case for you I would also like to correspond with you to trade stories and info on what you''ve learned and done. Be well. Sincerely; Rich - delcocat at aol *******,2009,2009,,
Atenolol+hypertension,Does anyone here have tingling and other weird sensory symptoms on a daily basis? Mine has been here for 6 years; but it seems that they are getting worse. I find it hard to believe that people can have these weird sensations from anxiety alone. I have had a brain MRI and c-spine MRI; the only thing that showed was a bulging disk. Anyone else have this?,2006,2006,34,Female
Atenolol+hypertension,For a couple of weeks; I have a vibrating sensation in the penis area. I first thought my cell phone may have started it since I have had it attached to my belt; on the vibrate status. I stopped doing this and still feel it. It is either a vibration or a sensation of filling up with liquid. No other symptoms are there. No pain in urination; no pain in sex; have been married for many years with one partner; and no urge to go to the bathroom. It happens randomly; and lasts for 3-6 seconds then goes away. It is irritating but not painful. Any thoughts on this issue would be helpful.,2006,2006,,
Atenolol+hypertension,There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the "spot" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?,2008,2008,,Male
Atenolol+hypertension,Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?,2006,2006,,
