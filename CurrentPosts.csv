1,Amlodipine+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40.0,Female,,,40yearold ladi I diagnos hypertens 200100 sinc 2005 I take atenolol 25 mg nightli 2 year In 2007 I deliv babi boy age 37 sinc I rapid weight gain short breath I walk step climb stair I feel uneasi breath I exert after rest goe I continu atenolol 25 mg I underw echo 2008 normal I also underw lipid profil ldl triglycerid high sinc BP control atenolol cardiologist suggest take carvedilol 625 mg after 2 year I underw master health checkup I underw echo treadmil test chest xray blood urin test again reveal BP high ldl triglycerid high cardiologist precrib month carvedilol anticholesterol medic even take drug I uneasi chest I exert He suggest undergo angiogram then I check anoth cardiologist chang carvedilol amlodipin BP then chang combin atenolol amlodipin BP fine but I still uneasi chest I exert BP control sometim goe 150100 My thyroid function normal My diabet test normal My triglycerid ldl still reduc I take atorvastatin lipid last 6 month I sever daytim somnol I work medic transcriptionist My job stress job I depress took antidepress 3 month last year after take I irregular cycl weight gain I stop My daytim sleepi sever I abl concentr work I abl peac sleep when I sleep night I feel awak whole night race thought I feel rest I get I heavi snore I underw pulmonari function test normal I took chest xray doctor felt I might cardiomegali I underw eye exam vision perfectli normal except dri eye I use artifici tear I extern hemorrhoid kindli suggest test done daytim somnol rapid weight gain I check almost specialti I confus reason would

4,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,70.0,Male,,,I male 70 year age I 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 thi control BP within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 My doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 My concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level Do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead I tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret

6,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hello; I'm 45yo.caucasian male.Height 173 cm; Weight 68 kg.2;5 months ago I started taking Lodoz 2;5 mg (bisoprolol with diuretic); blood persure before taking medicine was approximately 160/100. The medicine was prescribed in the same dose by general practice doctor 2;5 months ago . In the meantime I did ultrasound of the heart and the result seems to be OK. as wel as EKG. In addition to hypertension I have high cholesterol values(Tested on 20/03/2009: Choletsrol was 5;6; LDL= 3;5 ; HDL =1;42; b on 05/05/2009 i did another test in different lab; results were Cholesterol= 6.9; LDL=4;90; HDL=1;20. I do not take any drug for cholesterol;have started using fermented red rice. I am still smoking. "" Lodoz""2;5 mg seems to control my blood preasure fine. I don't have problems with heart rate (usually between 70 and 80 during the day and around 60 in the morning) before taking beta blocker I usually had quite high HR (approximately 90) I'm writing all this because it seems that I started to suffer from ""Erectile Dysfunction""or at least everything seems to be pretty much different than before. Behavior has been changing during period of taking drug. In the meantime I was reading a lot and would appreciate professional help;advice; suggestions and comments. I have found out that there is not easy to stop taking ""BETA BLOCKERS"" if needed it has to be gradually. I wonder would it be worth of trying switching to other BETA BLOCKER that is more selective such as ""NEBIVOLOL"". ; could I switch to ACE inhibitor (was taking one 5 years ago; they were working for me at that time as well.My blood pressure was then marginal and quit after about month and a half) or maybe should I switch to something like ""LOSARTAN"" Thank You very much for help in advance Kind regards; Bruno",2009,2009,45.0,Male,68.0,173.0,hello Im 45yocaucasian maleheight 173 cm weight 68 kg25 month ago I start take lodoz 25 mg bisoprolol diuret blood persur take medicin approxim 160100 the medicin prescrib dose gener practic doctor 25 month ago In meantim I ultrasound heart result seem OK wel ekg In addit hypertens I high cholesterol valuestest 20032009 choletsrol 56 ldl 35 hdl 142 b 05052009 anoth test differ lab result cholesterol 69 ldl490 hdl120 I take drug cholesterolhav start use ferment red rice I still smoke lodoz25 mg seem control blood preasur fine I dont problem heart rate usual 70 80 day around 60 morn take beta blocker I usual quit high HR approxim 90 Im write seem I start suffer erectil dysfunctionor least everyth seem pretti much differ behavior chang period take drug In meantim I read lot would appreci profession helpadvic suggest comment I found easi stop take beta blocker need gradual I wonder would worth tri switch beta blocker select nebivolol could I switch ace inhibitor take one 5 year ago work time wellmi blood pressur margin quit month half mayb I switch someth like losartan thank you much help advanc kind regard bruno

8,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear. But im wondering now if it was from this pulmonary hypertention...???? All the articles im finding on PH says it is fatal and always progresses!!!,2015,2015,32.0,Female,54.0,170.0,I 33 year old femal mother 3 year old twin worri recent echo result I start palpit year ago random chest pain everi whileenough worri So start see cardiologist coupl yr ago everi sinc begin seem minim symptom test result ive wore holter monitor twice state tachycardia otherwis seem normal My echo one year ago show mild mitral valv prolaps borlerlin leaki valvebut otherwis state echo look normal strong well went anoth echo month ago show mild mitral valv prolaps expect also said surpris find mild pulmonari hypertens He total blew said noth worri sinc wasnt symptom said schedul 6 month He state sometim thesenfind echo wrong felt noth concern feel uneasi find request 2 echo report compar year old echo show 35 pressur one yr later show 40 whi isnt concern I schedul appt pulmonari doctor next wk worri sick I 57 weigh 120lbshave regular lower BP otherwis healthi otherwis A coupl month ago wss short breath felt like congest chest even went famili doctor said lung sound clear but im wonder pulmonari hypertent all articl im find PH say fatal alway progress

15,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 40 year-old wife in recent months has undergone a number of tests following some weight loss. It transpires that she is suffering from hypertension with her 24hr ambulatory readings averaging at 170/110. Further diagnostic tests (ECG; echo and cardiac MRI) were undertaken and her cardiologist told her that her heart is enlarged (moderate) with impaired function (I believe ejection fraction in the region of 45%) but has not been able to identify the root cause of the hypertension. She is asymptomatic and does not have any issues in terms of fatigue; breathlessness; swelling; etc. She has been prescribed 5mg Amlodipine; 5mg Ramipril and 2.5mg Bisprolol. The Cardiologist has told her she will be on medication for longevity and that improving the condition will take a long time. Her blood pressure has already come down to 132/84 which the cardiologist was very pleased with. She will be seeing him again in 8/9 weeks with a follow up echo in 4/5 months. In terms of the diagnosis; the cardiologist has referred only to hypertension but having read and aligned the symptoms of the enlarged heart and impaired function; is it not heart failure.....? Also; what is the prognosis for an enlarged heart caused by hypertension; especially in someone of 40 years of age.....can the enlarged heart and function return to normal over time with the medication?

16,Amlodipine+hypertension,Thank you all that have shared your stories and journey with this disease. I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with hypertension with kidney failure? Harley's bp are high and he's on the highest doses of medication they can give him. Because of the hypertension and now a heart murmurs the vet feels that giving him subq fluids will do more harm than good. Has anyone else found a way to balance fluids with hypertension? His creatinine level is 3.8; BUN is 96 and phosphorous is 9 all which have doubled in the past week and with BP's around 160/100. He's on encard; enalapril; Amlodipine; Epakatin and Pepcid. My little guy Harley was first diagnosed with kidney disease when he was 5; he is now 13 wow! He was asymptomatic for 8 years; our only intervention was diet. Harley is now getting to end stage; even though I know this would happen it's still so hard. Who knew that a 20lb beagle would be the love of my life.

18,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi doctor; Firstly thankyou in advance for your service. I am a 26 year old female; 125lbs 5'5''; non-smoker. I was diagnosed as having Hypertension when I was 23; no family history of any cardiac problems. I had all the routine tests to rule out secondary causes and was therefore diagnosed as having essential/primary hypertension and commenced on Losartan; my BP remained uncontrolled running about 150/100 and throughout numerous months my medication was changed; finally settling at 100mg Losartan and 10mg Amlodipine which kept my BP controlled at around 120/70. I have recently had a baby and my BP again became very uncontrolled at the end of pregnancy and I was induced; my BP remained high after the birth between 140-160/100-110 and 4 weeks later I had a suspected TIA were I lost feeling down my left side and had diffilculty speaking; this episode lasted around 2minutes in total. I have since been under going routine tests to confirm or rule out a TIA and was commenced on aspirin. The MRI and Carotid artery ultrasound were negative and the Echo/TOE (TEE) showed my heart was fine except the presense of a 'small hole' my doctor said the hole is very common and that they do not think there is any need to close it. My questions to you are: Is it likely the small hole is a PFO? Could there be any relation between the PFO and my unexplained hypertension in someone my age?

19,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi. I am a 53-yr-old female and live in the mountains of Colorado at least half of the year (for the last 13 years) at 10;000.' I have been an extremely strong athlete to the point of climbing very briskly up to Base Camp on Mt. Everest in 2003. Over the past couple of years; I have become increasingly out of breath with exercise at high elevations. I have had several ECGs done and they look excellent although borderline Pulmonary Hypertension is being considered and I'm going to have an exercise catherization done. I've spent the last 3 months on oxygen but do not need it at sea level. My internist in Chicago believes I'm having an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise and hi altitude (my bp is much higher up there) and recently told me that he has a patient who lives both in Chicago and in Aspen and has a similar issue. His cardiologist in Aspen put him on Norvasc; saying that it is specific for altitude induced hypertension. A cardiologist that I saw on Friday at the Cleveland Clinic could not confirm this. Any feedback to this question? I'm pretty desperate to get back to life as I once knew it!,2012,2012,53.0,Female,,,Hi I 53yrold femal live mountain colorado least half year last 13 year 10000 I extrem strong athlet point climb briskli base camp Mt everest 2003 over past coupl year I becom increasingli breath exercis high elev I sever ecg done look excel although borderlin pulmonari hypertens consid Im go exercis cather done ive spent last 3 month oxygen need sea level My internist chicago believ Im exagger blood pressur respons exercis hi altitud bp much higher recent told patient live chicago aspen similar issu hi cardiologist aspen put norvasc say specif altitud induc hypertens A cardiologist I saw friday cleveland clinic could confirm ani feedback question Im pretti desper get back life I knew

21,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I'm a 63 yr old female who has recently been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and hypertension. I haven't really experienced any overt symptoms of hypothyroidism beyond dry skin and possibly ""brain fog"" (after reading some of the comments of other posts - I think I can identify with that!). My TSH was extremely high (52 -- normal lab values to 2.5) and can't figure out why I didn't have more symptoms. My BP in Dr's office was very high - 177/90. Since then I have followed it at home for a week and have found only about 1 high reading a day of about 136/79 with 4 or 5 readings of about 117/74 with occasionally much lower readings. I've been on Lisinopril 20mg for 7 days and Levothyroxin 50 mcg for 4 days and feel ""strange""-- sometimes light-headed and weak. Is it possible to connect the elevated BP and hypothyroidism and is it possible to have a TSH value that high and not experience more hypothyroid symptoms?

25,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter.

34,Amlodipine+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate.

35,Amlodipine+hypertension,My BP was well-controlled on 100 mg Losartin and 7.5 mg Amlodipine; averaging around 125/68. At peak exertion; during a treadmill stress test recently; my systolic BP reached 215. My cardiologist subbed 5 mg Nebivolol for the Amlodipine due to what he described as exercise-related hypertension. I took this medication for a week and experienced a range of unpleasant side effects; including exhaustion; significant depression and reduced heart rate (mid-60s; compared with my normal mid-80s). I've been off the Nebivolol for five days; but I'm still experiencing these side effects. My heart rate has only come back to about 67-68. Given the half-life of this drug and the fact that I only took it for a week; these side effects seem excessive. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I see my cardiologist again on Tuesday; but in the meantime; I'm having a tough time concentrating at work and I'm very concerned.

Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS?

Doctor check and read 95 / 170. Had been taking Losar 25 (Losartan Potassium IP). Doctor increased the dosage to Losar 25x2 +Amlodipine Basilate 5mg. Still not much relief in the discomfort level. At random I have a kind of heaviness on my head; a feeling consistent with a person taking strong wine giving a post-feeling muscle pull on the face.(I do not drink or smoke). Also a kind of numbness is also felt at times. Discomfort or pain in the back and left side of head is felt (infrequent). Did an MRI Scan on 20 Jan 2012. 'Findings': T2 & FLAIR hyperintensities noted in bilateral fronto-parietal periventricular white-matter. (S/o Microvascular ischemic changes) Prominent Vircho Robin spaces noted in both basal ganglia and centrum semi-ovale regions. Ventricles appear mildly prominent.

46,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; First of all i would like to thank you or anyone for answering my question. I guess i have always had high blood pressure; recently at the doctors my blood pressure was 170/101 ; high? Yes; very high. I was given a medication; Amlodipine Besyl 2.5 mg tab. I was wondering if there are any great adverse side effects to this medicine? I know its good to take a healthy lifestyle to get my blood pressure down and it would just be good overall for everything. Would hypertension be one of the reasons to cause a sort of chronic fatigue? Also; if you know this; but does hypertension play a big role on your immune system or bodies ability to make antibodies? Thank you in advance for your replies; any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.,2011,2011,,Male,,,Hi first would like thank anyon answer question I guess alway high blood pressur recent doctor blood pressur 170101 high ye high I given medic amlodipin besyl 25 mg tab I wonder great advers side effect medicin I know good take healthi lifestyl get blood pressur would good overal everyth would hypertens one reason caus sort chronic fatigu also know hypertens play big role immun system bodi abil make antibodi thank advanc repli suggest comment would appreci

53,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 3 1/2 yr old grandson has high blood pressure (180/120 when not on amlodipine); abdominal pain usually radiating from the umbilicus; extremity (usually leg) numbness to the point of occasional collapse; loss of appetite; weight loss; sometimes naussea and/or diarrhea. He has also had episodes of temporary blindness. This all began to manifest this summer (1 month after he turned 3 yrs. old). Prior to that he seemed to be a bright healthy happy child. In retrospect he may have been having intermittant spells of abdominal pain associated with this for several months before his first hospitalization in August 2007 as well as rapid onset (2 weeks) of a lazy eye in the spring of 2007 which may or may not be associated. He has now been hospitalized 4 times at Texas Children's Hospital. He has 5 doctors: pediatrician; renal; g.i.; neuro; and an opthamalogist. He is on Amlodipine daily; Zofran as needed; and most recently Periactin daily. He has had numerous head and abdominal CT scans with and without contrast; MRI's; Ultrasound; DMSA(?); 24 hrs. urinalysis; blood work. They can't find the cause of any of the symptoms. We've been through many diagnoses including acid reflux; psychosomatic pain for attention; Mesenteric Lymphadenitis; possible pheochromocytoma; inflammation of the brain and the latest is possibly abdominal migraines. Recently a friend's daughter was diagnosed with Addison's Syndrome and they have many of the same symptoms. Do you have any suggestions and in your opinion should we ask about seeing an Endocrinologist. One of the problems with so many doctors and Texas Children's Hospital is that each doctor seems to be just looking at their piece of the pie and have not yet all gotten together to compare notes.

54,Amlodipine+hypertension,"2009: episodes of chest pain; leading to cardiac cath with diagnosis of Prinzmetal's . Was started on amlodipine 5mg daily; continuation of Benicar 40mg daily (for chronic hypertension) and aspirin 325mg daily. This was effective. April 2013: intermittent bilateral arm pain; starting near elbows and within 5 seconds or so; involves total arms; hands and fingers and fine motor movements totally impaired. This intense pain lasts about 3-5 minutes; episodes 2-4 times a week. Interventional Cardiologist ordered thallium treadmill test; and stated that no cardiac damage seen. Amlodipine changed to 5mg twice daily; nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg prn; L-Arginine 4000mg twice daily and red yeast rice 2 capsules daily. I do not eat red meat or fried foods. No relief of symptoms. Isosorbide dinitrate 30mg started; no relief. Changed to Isosorbide mononitrate 30mg; No relief. Developed hacking cough lasting 2 months after isosorbide mononitrate discontinued. From April 2013 to January 2014 the episodes occurred 2-4 times a week. Then I did not have any more spasms until March 17; 2014. Since then I have had at least five a week; three days ago; I had three episodes. I understand that there is provocative testing during cardiac cath that involves inducing coronary artery spasm to ID the offending artery; and then that artery can be stented. The spasm can be rescued by intravenous nitroglycerin. My Interventional Cardiologist will not do this. I have not had any CHEST PAIN since 2009. I am 72 years old; 5'5""; 145 pounds; and walk 3 miles a day; up and down hills. B/P controlled; triglycerides and cholesterol within normal limits.

55,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I went to the doctors today and my blood pressure was 179/108. I do not really know much about the complications of hypertension or what can be done besides daily exercise. I have a prescription of AMLODIPINE BESYL 2.5 MG tablets. Are there any complications taking this medication for hypertension? I hear that it is bad to take medication because your body gets used to it. I am a 24 year old male; 6 foot tall weighing at 333 lbs. So im assuming it is my weight that is causing my blood pressure to be so high. Are there any tips besides daily exercise for reduction in blood pressure? Do i have to take medication forever or stop as soon as i get to a normal BP with a change in my dietary habits and weight issue?

58,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 ; ie High normal .. I didn't panic and I started to work on my lifestyle but nothing improved . After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings was always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist because I was obsessed with the idea of being hypertensive at this age ; 24 . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal (ranging bet . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and live my life normally and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were always ideal most of the time until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! The chest pain and palpitations frustrated me and I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Heart Ultrasound ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) The doctor ended up diagnosing essential hypertension after excluding a 2ry one especially after I made a kidney Ultrasound which was normal also . He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!!! I went to many doctors as you can see but no one could tell me what I am suffering from !!! I have been living in a misery for the past year and a half and don't really know what to do ??!! The doctors kept telling me that I am Ok and there is nothing to worry about ; but I am not Ok . I can feel myself more than anyone . Now ; I have those symptoms of the headaches ; stress and load around my head PLUS the palpitaions and right side chest pain despite taking the Amlodipine daily . What should I do ?!!! Pls. help me through this . Waiting your important response . Ahmed NB. Sex : Male . Age : 25 .

59,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi All - new on here. I have had three episodes of AF (July 06; Jan 08 and Feb 08); first treated with IV Flecanaide but the doctors are unwilling to use that again; so have put me on Amiodarone; Bisoprolol and Warfarin; on top of the meds I was already taking (Amlodipine; Losartan; Simvastatin); which seem to make me very tired and lethargic all of the time; and also very 'constricted' - even gentle excercise makes my chest tight and breathing difficult; and when I stand from sitting or crouching I nearly pass out. The consultant has discussed the topic of Ablation very briefly; but I think there are other tests they could do first? (treadmill; 48/72 hour heart trace) I should mention that I also have thickening of the heart wall muscle; which they are not sure about (could have been caused by hypertension or could be HCM) - I have had a cardiac MRI last month so that might help when I see the results. Can anyone shed any light or offer any suggestions about this? I was led to understand that the Ablation; if successful; could enable me to come off some of the medication I am on; which might let me get back to excercising normally again. I am only 50 years old and up to these latest episodes fit and active (golf; squash; cycling etc; none of which I can do atm); so all this is a bit of a pain as you can imagine.

62,Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past six months I have been waking up with a pounding heart and numb hands along with a pain under both sides of my ribcage and a slight headache. I have taken my bloodpressure and it is 120/79. I went to see my doctor and he said; I had a slightly high blood pressure 135/85. He put me on Amlodipine Besylate 5mg. My pressure has been 120/ 80 since. I told him about the pounding heartbeat and he sent me for a stress test; which he said was normal. What could be causing the pounding heartbeat ? I also wakeup feeling weak and tired; but it seems to go away once I get out of bed. I am 54 and also suffer with anxiety disorder and agoraphobia; but I never had THESE feelings before.

He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well.

Going back; she just prescribed me with ferrous sulfate and continue with my previous mantainance meds LoSartan and amlodipine since I have diabetes and hypertension. And ask me to have my CBC since I'm bleeding and BHCG. Coz she said she couldn't see any sign of pregnancy. Or I already ad Early Miscarriage.

72,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Doc; I am 20; and was found to have hypertension (140~160/90~110); and my diastolic was known to go up to 128...I was a regular blood donor for 3 years; so my hypertension was a sudden one... My doctor initially thought I had Thyrotoxicosis/Hyperthyroidism; because in addition to the sudden pressure; I had sweaty palms; tremors; eye-nipping and a systolic murmur... My TSH; T4 and T3 levels were normal... I also tested negative for Pheochromocytoma; Renal Artery Stenosis and Conn's...MRI/Ultrasound showed nothing significant; although my doctor thinks my adrenal glands look bulky... My tremors have since become quite bad...They tremble so badly I am actually aware of it. Sometimes my whole limb is trembling so badly; I feel my whole body tremble as well...And when Im nervous (Im taking a public speaking class; and I have to give weekly speeches); it becomes very bad; and I can't even hold anything; and my legs tremble too...And I get numbness in my fingers; and sudden pain in my legs for no reason... Last night when I went to sleep; I saw flashes of lights in fornt of my eyes for a few minutes; and I seem to occasionally drool when I lie down... I am now on Norvasc (Amlodipine) 5mg OD; and Diovan (Valsartan) 160mg OD...Pressure pretty well controlled... Could my initial TSH; T4 and T3 levels be wrong ie a false negative? Or could my symptoms be because of something else or due to my medication? By the way; the doctor wants me to get tested for Porphyria... Please advise.

74,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

75,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 .. After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings were always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were Ok until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Echocardiogram ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY ) 5) Kidney Ultrasound ( No stenosis or Kidney issue ; so the Dr. excluded a 2ry hypertension ) He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!

78,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female,,,I put BP medic januari 2012 I start amlodipin lisinopril lisinopril darn near kill the prescrib doctor would not take I stop take made appoint anoth doctor I take 125 mg metoprolol 10 mg amlodipin 3 month I copd someth aggrav breath problem I went doctor yesterday took metoprolol put 100 mg losartan He told stop take metoprolol I question start high dose losartan I seem sensit medic felt start right 100 mg bit high everyth ive read onlin suggest peopl usual start 50 mg I question stop metoprolol suddenli both question fob I took first dose losartan 630 morn I alway take amlodipin 8 pm due hour A short time ago I suddenli terribl spell I felt like I wasnt go abl get breath go even nebul I felt like BP went ear felt like burn thi spell last 15 minut fast heart rate should losartan step metoprolol left kept rebound effect can anyon comment offer advic If I I would take chanc control high blood pressur natur would put toxic stuff bodi ive done lot research read past six month I read scare I get junk ive feed

80,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Dear All; I just stumbled on this website and I hope someone can help me. I am young (just turned 21!); but was diagnosed with sudden quite high hypertension (sometimes up to 160/128); which till today; doctors are adamant is caused by a secondary cause. But nobody can put a finger to what is the secondary cause. Have no family history; am female; and my BMI is 20. Have been a top student all this while; and have represented my state for national's in debate. Also active in public speeches etc. Lately; have started trembling real bad. Used to get trembling when I had to speak in front of public; but it goes away about a minute into speech. But now I tremble all the way; until the podium shakes; and even 15 minutes AFTER speech; I still tremble so badly I cant hold even a bottle of water. It affects mostly my left side of the body. Like yestedray; all through the day; my left thumb was trembling; even when I was resting my entire arm on the table. If I apply pressure to my thumb to stay still; I can see the vein (or whatever you call it) pulsating. Is this just a bad case of anxiety or is something wrong? One of the doctors was worried about my trembling; while another said ""anxious people tremble"". Tested negative for thyroid disorders; pheochromocytoma. Appreciate your time for reading this far.

Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96).

83,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hi; Im 27; 250lbs; 5'-11"" and I work out about 5 days a week; mostly cardio jogging and Anaerobic sprinting. My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor or doing? Im really worried that my heart will stop or that I have an underlying issue.

84,Amlodipine+hypertension,I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,25.0,Male,76.0,177.0,Im 25 year old weight 169 Im 5 10 My blood type A I consum lot red meat Im slightli activ I play soccer week go walk 3 day week I would like give brief histori medic issu within past 6 year get advic back I 19 I got bad flu I never experienc life I sick two week even I got better I felt hand leg numb I felt gener weak sinc I start experienc pressur pain left side chest thi someth new A month later I went doctor check I told blood pressur pre hypertens rang start 2009 I see doctor regularli tri differ BP medic current Im two medic one amlodipin besyl 75 MG norvasc medic paroxetin hcl 20 MG I take daili everi time I saw doctor BP still high 150 90 surpris suggest I tri 24 hour BP monitor I result interest 98 time BP 14090 4 read high I also done two ekg chest xray differ blood test chest mri result normal I also refer cardiologist ekg I told heart perfectli fine noth wrong could tell caus pain can blood pressur caus pain Do I go heartrel test what els I need order get ride pain Is someth els caus pain I would appreci help pleas let know need info

89,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi Everyone; I'm 41 male with history of hypertension. My BP stays around 170/100. Highest was recorded 176/110. I have been on Telmisartan 40mg for few weeks but it killed my sex drive entirely. I stopped taking it & gradually recovered from low libido. Also i've noticed a general decline in libido & an onset of ED after i crossed age 40. Now my libido is not that strong as it used to be 4 years back even without medicine. I discussed this with my cardiologist & he says it must have been something else as ARB's don't affect libido. Now he has prescribed me a combination drug (telmisartan 40mg + amlodipine 5mg) once a day. I'm really worried if it would again target my libido in a negative way. Please share you experiences & expertise to combat this side effect that makes you life so dull & boring.

91,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 20 and was diagnosed with pretty high hypertension (140~160/90~110) last year; of sudden onset. I am on Diovan 160mg (Valsartan) and Norvasc 5mg(Amlodipine); both once a day. BP is controlled most times of the day. Doctors initially thought I had thyrotoxicosis; as I had the symptoms and negative history for hypertension; and my BMI is 20.5. Tests showed normal levels of TSH; T4 and T3. My tremors of both hands; palpitations and sweaty palms are kinda getting more obvious. Morover; I seem to be getting cramps here and there; and my fingers get all tingly and numb. And I seem to urinating a whole lot more. Is it possible the thyroid tests were a false negative? Or could it be that the Valsartan I'm on is causing some deficiency in my body (like Potassium)? I tested negative for Pheochromocytoma. Please advise.

93,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am posting this for my 62 year old mother who generally feels well but has bouts of a condition that causes the following: -her head feel like it weighs 1000 pounds -terrible pain in her chest and this last time the pain was also on the right side of her lower back. -Her blood pressure spikes and her doctor puts her in the hospital; doctors have trouble stabilizing it once she gets to the hospital. She has been hospitalized 3 times in the last 3 years. The last time she was hospitalized it took 3 days to bring down her blood pressure which was at 180/120. Also the last time she was hospitalized in addition to chest pain she also had extreme pain on the right side of her lower back to the point where she could not bend over. She takes a daily dose of 20mg of Accupril and has for years. Except for when she has bouts of this condition her blood pressure is normal and she feels and looks very healthy. The attacks come without warning and no reason for them has been given. She feels absolutely awful when they come. She usually walks 3.5 miles per day and has for a year and feels well. After her last hospitalization she was sent home with Amlodipine Besylate 5MG. Each time she was treated she had a battery of blood work (numerous vials) in an attempt to find the cause. She was checked for a heart attack and also had a stress test. None of these have pinpointed a cause. She was also given needles to try and being down her blood pressure; I don't know the names of what they were. The pain in her chest is below breast; by rib cage. Each time she is sent home after her blood pressure is finally stabilized. After 6 months or sometimes a year it all comes back again without warning. The bouts seem to be coming closer together and more severe.,2009,2009,62.0,Female,,,I post 62 year old mother gener feel well bout condit caus follow head feel like weigh 1000 pound terribl pain chest last time pain also right side lower back her blood pressur spike doctor put hospit doctor troubl stabil get hospit she hospit 3 time last 3 year the last time hospit took 3 day bring blood pressur 180120 also last time hospit addit chest pain also extrem pain right side lower back point could bend she take daili dose 20mg accupril year except bout condit blood pressur normal feel look healthi the attack come without warn reason given she feel absolut aw come she usual walk 35 mile per day year feel well after last hospit sent home amlodipin besyl 5mg each time treat batteri blood work numer vial attempt find caus she check heart attack also stress test none pinpoint caus she also given needl tri blood pressur I dont know name the pain chest breast rib cage each time sent home blood pressur final stabil after 6 month sometim year come back without warn the bout seem come closer togeth sever

95,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather ""sloppy"" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms? Should I reduce it more slowly...over weeks or even months?",2011,2011,43.0,Male,,,I advis doctor chang 25 mg per day atenolol moder hypertens reduc BP well lisinopril 5mg I 25 mg day atenolol through miscommun doctor I didnt correctli understand I reduc dosag gradual I went pretti well straight start experienc arrhythmiasnot realli much fast heart beat irregular pvc ectop beat I would simpli refer rather sloppi consist normal sinu rhythm concern I went back atenolol 25mg immedi stop mention issu clearli causit I arrhythmia problem take atenolol My question Is reason expect gradual 10 day reduct dosag would result abl get medic without arrhythmat symptom should I reduc slowlyov week even month
96,Amlodipine+hypertension,"For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the ""world famous"" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it ""stabs and jabs""; another doctor called it ""electrical discharge headaches""; another doctor called it ""cluster headaches"". A previous doctor prescribed ""indomethecin""; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide.

97,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I have had 2 ECG's done; one back in January 2001 and the other just this week. 11 months apart. The first was fine; with no problems. The second (last week) shows 'Probable LVH' Now; I am concerned that this has happened with 11 months; I have been under alot of stress but blood pressure has been OK. I have found this out as I have recently been getting adrenaline rushes (sweats) after stabbing pains in the chest and general chest discomfort; mainly at rest in the evening. Should be I concerned as a 28 year old male?; not overweight - though big built and no family history of problems - More a fan of the pub than the gym to my disgrace. I figure that im not going to just keel over any minute; otherwise the doc would have taken more drastic measures than refering me to a specialist.

Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days.

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

99,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 19 year old otherwise healthy patient with symptoms that started about 5 months ago. My daily symptoms include racing heartbeat; palpitations; headache; dizziness; near-syncope upon standing; fatigue; nausea and hypertension. I have been tested for any thyroid problems; or endocrine problems and the tests came back normal. I am on Amlodipine 10mg daily for the blood pressure; but it is persistant and runs about 140/100 usually. I have had a 48 hour holter which showed a max HR of 176; min of 44 and normal sinus rhythm. Had a few EKGs that were normal except a short PR interval; echo was normal; and most recently had a tilt table test. Nothing was remarkable about the test until they administered sublingual Nitroglycerin spray; which prompted a HR increase from 86 to 140 bpm immediatly. All my symptoms came about at once and I nearly passed out so they stopped the test. Blood pressure stayed about the same throughout. My doctor was unable to attend so I am curious in the mean time about these findings on the test. My EP has suggested he thought it was probably Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia; but possibly POTS.

100,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm 46 years old. I have been taking medication (Ramipril 2.5mg; Amlodipine 5mg) for essential hypertension for the past 7 years. Blood pressure is normal whenever I get it tested. Is it necessary to continue this medication for the rest of my life. My doctor says that any change or reduction of medication is to be considered only after regular and more frequent(daily) blood pressure monitoring. Presently I'm not in a position to get it monitiored. I'm given to understand that the blood pressure monitors available in the market are not very accurate which rules out my own taking blood pressure daily. .I've no other problems (like diabetes or obesity etc).

101,Amlodipine+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system?

102,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; my old tom cat who is 20 and arthritic and fairly deaf has recently gone suddenly blind. We have taken him to the vet who said he has hypertension (he was already on treatment for kidney disease) and he is now on amolodipine. The vet said he has responded well to the kidney treatment and seems otherwise healthy and should adapt to his blindness in 3-4 weeks. My problem is he has given up trying to find his litter tray/food/water and howls (he did this as he went deaf but it is now more frequent). He will stand up and urinate on anything he is sleeping on and I am constantly taking him to his litter tray/ food/ water (He is eating and drinking well once placed there but howls until I check his needs rather than trying to find anything himself). He is generally mopey. In the morning I have to bathe him as he has sat in his own urine. I guess my worry is that I should not be putting him through all this and he will be on his own most of the day as I work full time normally. I would really appreciate advice / guidance / opinion from anybody who has experienced similar. How long should it take for any signs of improvement? I dont want him to be put to sleep unless this is the kindest option for him as he is much loved; but equally I dont want him to suffer.

103,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 62 years old and have been treated for high BP for over 15 years. I have been taking Toporal XR 25 mg. 3x qd; H ydrochlorathizide 5mg 1x qd for the last 2 years. I woke up Tuesday morning with my head spinning; very dizzy. I took my BP and it was 180/111 pulse 55. This whole week it has stayed between 160/100 to higher and the pulse lower than I have ever had. I went to the doctor; could not see my regular doc but saw the one handling urgent care Thursday. My left leg has been very painful for several months; worse behind the knee. She x-rayed my knee and saw arthritis ; which I knew was there. I have arthritis both kinds. Have taken 800 mg Ibuprofen for the pain; try not to take it often as I know it elevates BP and harmful to body. I also take aspirin; tylenol; and wear a Flector pain patch when it gets unbearable. I alternate with the pain meds dont take them the same days. The doctor put me on Tramadol for pain and made an appt. with my regular MD April 5th. I am scared because heart disease runs in my family; hypertension and stroke; some diabetes. I feel it would be wise for me to see my orthopaedist about my leg and see a specialist about my BP; cardiologist maybe. I have a heart murmur have since childhood; leaky valve; mitral valve prolapse. I also take meds for hypothyroid; depression (sertraline hcl); anxiety (PTSD); skelaxin; prn cyclobenzaprine (not with other meds); now tramadol hcl. Can someone validate my concern about waiting?

104,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Since then; every time that I went to doctor; my BP was in pre hypertension and my doctor recommended me to be physically active. Within the last 6 years; I was just not feeling right. I was confused (cloudy mind); experiencing lightheadedness; and dizziness; I felt pain on the left side of my chest radiating to my left shoulder and left hand all the time. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. The overall average was 122/74 and during the awake time; it was 125/77 and during the sleep time; it was 109/60. So he recommended me to continue taking my medications. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. The only thing that was slightly elevated was my cholesterol and doctor recommended me to exercise and do diet change. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. So I’m still taking my two medications but however; I still have the pain on my left chest and left shoulder and hand. One thing I have realized recently is that I’ve been running more and I’ve been feeling a little better. It seems that my pain reduced during my running and a few hours after I run. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,25.0,Male,,,Hi Im 25 year old weight 169 Im 5 10 My blood type A I consum lot red meat Im slightli activ I play soccer week go walk 3 day week I would like give brief histori medic issu within past 6 year get advic back I 19 I got bad flu I never experienc life I sick two week even I got better I felt hand leg numb I felt gener weak sinc I start experienc pressur pain left side chest thi someth new A month later I went doctor check I told blood pressur pre hypertens rang sinc everi time I went doctor BP pre hypertens doctor recommend physic activ within last 6 year I feel right I confus cloudi mind experienc lightheaded dizzi I felt pain left side chest radiat left shoulder left hand time start 2009 I see doctor regularli tri differ BP medic current Im two medic one amlodipin besyl 75 MG norvasc medic paroxetin hcl 20 MG I take daili everi time I saw doctor BP still high 150 90 surpris suggest I tri 24 hour BP monitor I result interest 98 time BP 14090 4 read high the overal averag 12274 awak time 12577 sleep time 10960 So recommend continu take medic I also done two ekg chest xray differ blood test chest mri result normal the thing slightli elev cholesterol doctor recommend exercis diet chang I also refer cardiologist ekg I told heart perfectli fine noth wrong So Im still take two medic howev I still pain left chest left shoulder hand one thing I realiz recent ive run ive feel littl better It seem pain reduc run hour I run could tell caus pain can blood pressur caus pain Do I go heartrel test what els I need order get ride pain Is someth els caus pain I would appreci help pleas let know need info
105,Amlodipine+hypertension,Recently I was dignosed with High Blood Pressure. My previous doctor recognized it was high back in December. I went to a doctor late in May. She diagnosed me with HBP. My readings have been like 156/85 and as high as 167/90. I have been on Benazepril since May. I have felt better ever since taking the medicine no doubt. Not one single headache and I generally feel better. My blood pressure had went down a little on my last vist. It was about 148/84. The doctor still saw the need to put me on another medication; so now im taking Benazepril and Amlodipine. And at times checking my BP myself it has been down to like 127/80. Im only 24 and thats what worries me. I have a family history of High Blood Pressue big time. My Grandad and Dad both had it. My Dads was so high; at the time they couldnt even maintain it. Im also overweight. During my first visit to the doc I weighed about 250 at 6 feet tall. Most of my fat is central; stored in my stomach. Since then Ive been working out and running. I was down to 226 during my last visit. Ive changed by diet up and have become more active. Besides adding another medication; the doc also did a bunch of bloodwork. My CBC and all blood work; including thryoid function and ALL of that other stuff was all normal. Except my urine test. A small amount of protein showed up in my urine. And she recommended that I get an Ultrasound of my kidneys and abdomen. I didnt have the money to get it done between the last 2 visits. And she still wants it done. She kind of worried me big time that somethine may be fatally wrong with my kidneys. It may be my kidneys causing my HBP. Or is it my HBP causing protein in my urine and kidney problems??? Im worried to death now; at only 24 years old. I have a bit of anxiety at times and dont really know what to think. Im having the ulrasound done in a week. What are the common reasons for the problems im having here. Im overweight and have a fam history of HBP. But could my one case be different?? Could my kidneys be failing?? Ive never had any problems really. I get sharp pains in my right side sometimes. Appendicitis was ruled out a while back. My sister also has problems like this as well. I never have problems urinating either. Except I go ALOT when I drink a ton of water or beer. But Ive always been like that. And my mom is like that too. So i never looked into that much.

108,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life.

I was diagnosed about 2 months ago with Hypertension. at that time my readings were average 160/80. I was prescribed Amlodipine 5mg once a day. the doctor insisted that i just stick to this medication. Since then I have had other symptoms such as dizziness; faint spells; racing heart beats and severe bathroom urges. I contacted them about this and they set up another appointment; but since it is a county health department it was about a month out. I have had to wear protective undergarments to bed because i wake up with damn sheets.(not soaked but like 1-2 ounces) after my last ER trip; they said my vitals were fine; a little high but fine. was checked in at 150/80. i am just curious of what to look out for. I had bathroom incidents about 10 years ago due to a car injury; but have been dry since then.

111,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a male 40 years with slight hypertension for which I am taking S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg). My height is 5 feet 10 inches; weight is 75 kg. I had bad asthma for 2 years which was treated with asthalin inhaler but I no longer have it nor do I use the inhaler or any other medication for asthma. I am a software engineer by profession. Fitnesswise - I can do about 40 pushups and jog for 30 minutes non stop. I have two problems - dry skin and insomnia; listing them both since I am not sure if they are related. The dry skin problem is nothing new I have had dry skin (extreme dandruff) on scalp; beard; etc. but the problem has gotten worse lately. lately the skin under chin becomes reddish (raw) easily after shaving and burns slightly. The other major problem is that I seem to only be able to sleep when I am extremely tired (been without sleep for long time); I also get disturbed sleep; Many times I go to bed at 11 pm but only get sleep at around 4 am; I then wake up at around 1.30 pm. I get very realistic dreams and disturbed sleep; nose gets blocked at night sometimes. After waking up - I dont feel very rested; I have difficulty concentrating; eye lids feel heavy; lazy. I saw a doctor who conducted some tests for the sleep issue. According to the tests - Vitamin; E; D count is low; triglyceride and esinophil count is slightly high. Bp; Sugar; ecg; thyroid are normal. The doctor recommended vitamin D; E supplements and some tablets for the esinophil which I completed the entire course. Another doctor recommended sertagress - 25 (Sertaline HCL 25 mg) and Ativan 1 mg (lorazepam 1 mg) tablets which I took for 6 months but they were not helping; had nasty side effects and I still had sleep issues; thus I tapered them off over 3 months. I am no longer taking sertagress or any sleep medicine. During school time the doctor diagnosed sleep issue to be caused by high blood pressure (hypertension) He recommended S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg) tablets which I am taking even now and since 15 years. My blood pressure is almost always around 130-90. the aggravagated insomnia problem is there for almost 2 years now.

112,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I was told about a year ago that the walls of my left ventricle were slightly thickened. I had a full cardiac workup done. I had extensive blood tests; stress test; echo; holter monitor and ecg. A few months later another echo and then the test were they go down your esophagus to look at the heart. I can't remember the name of it. The last tests showed that the thickness had come down close to normal. The cardiologists I had seen told me I may have had a virus or high blood pressure that caused the problem. Anyway they told me I should be fine and to go on with my normal life and I should not have any problems. My question is that I have done some bodybuilding and am very active. I am 26 with normal blood pressure and cholesteral levels and I do not smoke. I was wondering if I am at a risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest because of this. I have had a lot of anxiety over this and have some skipped heart beats now and then. I am worried when working out or when I am active I am going drop dead.

118,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries ""clamped down"" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and ""improper"" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial. I had no insurance when I had the heart attack (husband was out of work and just got a new job) and there is a 9 month waiting period for anything pre-existing...

120,Amlodipine+hypertension,My doctor diagnosed me with anxiety/depression. The thing is; he diagnosed me with this condition after spending only less than 5 minutes in the exam room with me. My concern is that it may actually be my heart. (I recently started a hypertension medicine (amlodipine)). Most times I feel fine. But lately I've been having issues with running out of breath easily with activity (although I am 300lb; so I know that does have something to do with it); occasional chest pressure; and starting today my left arm feels very heavy. I also have been having a churning feeling in my stomach the past 2 days along with indigestion. Since I'm worrying so much about my possible heart problem; my anxiety gets worse. I have a return visit to the doctor on November 28th. It's a very busy office; so getting in sooner is basically out of the question. Any input and reassurance would be greatly appreciated!,2011,2011,23.0,Female,,,My doctor diagnos anxietydepress the thing diagnos condit spend less 5 minut exam room My concern may actual heart I recent start hypertens medicin amlodipin most time I feel fine but late ive issu run breath easili activ although I 300lb I know someth occasion chest pressur start today left arm feel heavi I also churn feel stomach past 2 day along indigest sinc Im worri much possibl heart problem anxieti get wors I return visit doctor novemb 28th it busi offic get sooner basic question ani input reassur would greatli appreci

122,Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a copy of my treadmill test results. My ST was flat at about 0.9 out to about 90 BPM (V3); then dropped with a near constant slope to -0.9 at about 120 BPM and then dropped with a steeper slope to -3.8 at 142 BPM. The recovery line followed the test line to about 120 BPM and then recoved with a smaller slope to about -.1 at 80 BPM after 11 minutes of recovery time. I did not experience any angina during the test. The angiogram showed three blockages; two in one branch artery at 90 and 75% and the second in another branch artery at 75%. The two blockages are in a branch off of the LAD. The other is in a branch off of the RCA. The 90% block is right at the junction of the branch. I tried to paste a picture showing the locations of the blockages; but would not work. The doctor put me on Amlodipine besylate and Metroprolol. The cardiologist said that my condition is not life threatening as long as I manage my lifestyle.. Can I infer a safe exercise level from the treadmill test results? I am 6' and 196 #. Up to the day of the treadmill I was exercising on a daily basis on the elliptical and rowing machine for 30-45 mintes with my heartrate at 125 to 130 BPM to lose weight and stay in shape. I am coming back from 4 months of sedentary life recovering from a detached retinal requiring multiple procedures to fix. The cardiologist has said that we will reassess the need and benefit for a stent in about 3 weeks with another treadmill and nuclear. I have improved my diet; but can I really expect an improvement in the treadmill results with diet and drugs in one month? The doctor suggested that if I had continued to exercise at the higher BPM; it would have eventually led to a heart attack; suggesting a strong correlation between ST depression and death. If the blockages are addressed with stents; does that mean that mean that my ST depression will be mitigated? If so; does that mean that I can get back to a more rigorous exercise regimen?

123,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all?

124,Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7. Also World Journal of Gastroenterology 2005;11(48):7560-7563 has an article on losartan and fibrosis and there are other articles on the Internet.,2009,2009,,Male,,,I liver transplant 2000 get cirrhosi follow hepat abvd chemotherapi fail interferon alpha therapi unfortun hcv elimin I ran across articl indic losartancozaar blood pressur medicin may reduc elimin fibrosi I ask doctor chang blood pressur medicin coincid visit detect fibrosi feel stiff liver the hepat stellat cell hsc activ myofibroblastlik cell produc fibrosi angiotensin II losartan act block angiotensin II receptor cost 6000 per month medicar vasotec cost 500 per month I wonder enalaprilvasotec angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitor would fibrosi reduc effect losartan sinc stop angiotensin II form first place work well block receptor angiotensin II dock cheaper cost I found posit answer chines medic journal 2001 vol 114 No 6 page 5837 also world journal gastroenterolog 2005114875607563 articl losartan fibrosi articl internet

We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS?

126,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I am a male; 28 yrs old. I started medications for hypertension (amlodipine) and high cholesterol (crestor) in Dec 2013. After seven months on these I developed weird symptoms. I have been suffering from fogginess for the past 9 months. It's a fuzzy feeling in my brain and eyes. I also used to be very fatigued at times to a point where I could barely stand. Apart from this I have gastritis and heartburn though it has got better recently. I also suffered from unexpected weight loss. However currently my weight is more steady. I had all sorts of medical tests done on me. Only recently I was diagnosed with low vitamin D levels (less than 4.2) and low normal vitamin B12. I have stopped my medications for the past two months. However even though other symptoms seems to be getting better my fogginess has been lingering on. Has anybody else got similar experiences?,2015,2015,28.0,Male,,,hello I male 28 yr old I start medic hypertens amlodipin high cholesterol crestor dec 2013 after seven month I develop weird symptom I suffer foggi past 9 month it fuzzi feel brain eye I also use fatigu time point I could bare stand apart I gastriti heartburn though got better recent I also suffer unexpect weight loss howev current weight steadi I sort medic test done onli recent I diagnos low vitamin D level less 42 low normal vitamin b12 I stop medic past two month howev even though symptom seem get better foggi linger ha anybodi els got similar experi
127,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor. Can anyone give me suggestions I'm to young and on to many pills and refuse to be disabled but it looks like that's not gonna be my choice if something doesn't change soon; thanks.,2016,2016,30.0,Male,,,I 30 year old male I guess ill start begin I rememb when I 8 I diagnos osgood slaughter diseas start bad arthriti knee made difficult play play sport I still throughout childhood I alway felt tire sluggish energi drive mild hypertens I alway slightli averag size weight muscular I also suffer stomach issu throughout childhood lot diarrhea constip never regular In 2008 I ruptur larg intestin told multipl doctor ga I went eras CT scan nearli week pass I extrem amount infect cut open remov lot small larg intestin bad clean infect multipl organ they diagnos diverticul I mani antibiot time In 2012 start multipl high blood attack I would taken error BP around 220 150 they start hydrochlorothiazid didnt work ad benazepril amlodipin help littl bit work way back then ad prozac buspiron xanax need found lot blood pressur attack anxieti In 2014 I sever pain feet found I larg heel spur feet In 2015 march ear ach side head swell colliflow ear alway problem antibiot work start augmentin didnt work put ciprofloxacin doctor often thing work infect 3 week antibiot I also end bad yeast infect everytim take antibiot In juli I anoth issu intestin diagnos crohn hospit day bad crohn attack fill antibiot gastrointestin doctor start prednison I took month till around septemb had worst withdraw symptom I crawl step took ween A week I prednison I start bad lower back pain My doctor gave flexeril didnt work pain got wors next month In januari 2016 I I could work sleep sit without extrem pain I mri done I 10 bulg disc 5 herniat In mid lower back multipl bone spur vertebra worn size I first 3 steroid epidur shot februari work week never pain spread area pain worsen I also bone spur mani joint hip shoulder finger the past month felt like someth eat bodi insid Im extrem pain get wors night take forev get go morn whenev I take break pain med dont work I take nsaid stomach bleed tri nerv pain pill Im allerg I feel like someth caus doctor cant figur health fall rapid pace Im still work hard past day feel like hip fall place I read candida wonder bring doctor can anyon give suggest Im young mani pill refus disabl look like that gon na choic someth doesnt chang soon thank

129,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain.

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment?

130,Amlodipine+hypertension,My mother (56+ yrs) is under treatment for Hypothyroidism; Hypertension; Osteoporosis along with Osteo Arthritis. For Hypertension; she had taken Olsar 40 from Feb; 2014 to Dec; 2014; after which our medicine doctor has changed it to Olmat 20 AM; which she has been taking since past 3-months; during which most of her BP readings (using mercury device) are either 120/80 or 130/80. However; 2-3 days back; she started feeling the surrounding very hot & uncomfortable with complete loss of appetite & thirst. Also; she felt to have indigestion & a little fever (99.5); which got normalized after a day after taking medicines like crocin & pundinhara. However; during these 2-3 days whenever we measured her BP (using Omron electronic monitor) most of her readings are around 125/80 with pulse between 80-85; which is quite higher than her usual electronic BP readings 110/70 & pulse 70-75. Also; since the mercury BP readings are usually 10-15 units higher than that of electronic readings; I am worried whether these 125/80 readings correspond to mercury readings higher than 140/90; which means her BP is not really under control. Can you please help us with the below mentioned queries - 1) Do you feel her discomfort was related to indigestion problem or; could it be related to higher BP or heart issues ? 2) She usually takes her BP medicine (Olmat 20 AM) around 9:30 in the morning. Usually her morning BP (before medicine) is 5-10 units higher than evening BP. Is this normal or; sign of any heart problem ? 3) Do you see any need for BP medicine change or more investigations here ? 4) If she encounters similar problems in future; what is most advisable to do ? 5) Just to note: her FBS was 103 in Dec; 2014 & 92 in Feb; 2015 after certain dietary changes; although PPBS was normal (90). Is this slightly higher tendency of FBS related to her situation ? 6) Couple of weeks back she had fever with cold/cough (URTI); after which she was given antibiotic by our medicine doctor & asked to stop her calcium medicine (Shelcal CT) for 10-days. Could it be related to her BP increase since her BP medicine contains Amlodipine ?,2014,2015,56.0,Female,,,My mother 56 yr treatment hypothyroid hypertens osteoporosi along osteo arthriti for hypertens taken olsar 40 feb 2014 dec 2014 medicin doctor chang olmat 20 AM take sinc past 3month BP read use mercuri devic either 12080 13080 howev 23 day back start feel surround hot uncomfort complet loss appetit thirst also felt indigest littl fever 995 got normal day take medicin like crocin pundinhara howev 23 day whenev measur BP use omron electron monitor read around 12580 puls 8085 quit higher usual electron BP read 11070 puls 7075 also sinc mercuri BP read usual 1015 unit higher electron read I worri whether 12580 read correspond mercuri read higher 14090 mean BP realli control can pleas help us mention queri 1 Do feel discomfort relat indigest problem could relat higher BP heart issu 2 she usual take BP medicin olmat 20 AM around 930 morn usual morn BP medicin 510 unit higher even BP Is normal sign heart problem 3 Do see need BP medicin chang investig 4 If encount similar problem futur advis 5 just note fb 103 dec 2014 92 feb 2015 certain dietari chang although ppb normal 90 Is slightli higher tendenc fb relat situat 6 coupl week back fever coldcough urti given antibiot medicin doctor ask stop calcium medicin shelcal CT 10day could relat BP increas sinc BP medicin contain amlodipin
131,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello all; I have had the pain for about 8 years and docs have not been able to id. So; thought I might se if anyone has any other thoughts. I have pain when I stand; walk; seat or lay down (this is e order of level of pain as well - standing is the worse). When I stand the bottom of my feet will throb. Sometimes most of the bottom and sometimes I will get certain points like the heel or by the big toe that almost feels like a cigarette burn. Other time like when I seat from inside e ankle to my whole foot will burn/tingle. It's almost like the pressure on the back of my leg causes this. Also; sometimes if you run your hand from the top of my leg to the ankle you can feel;it go from warm to very cld at the ankle. This has been gradually getting worse over the past 8 years and I have seen a ton of doctors. General doc; nuralagist; chiro; podiatrist; homeopathy; acupuncture; pulmutalagist;. I have had MRI leg; ankle; back; X-ray; blood pressure test; nerve conduction test; lots of blood work with nothing being found.

132,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?",2009,2009,71.0,Female,,,medic histori My mom age 71live singapor histori hypertens she hospit 509 drug hypertens medic methyldopa induc cholestasi prescrib new Dr while hospit diagnos atrial fibril 2de result normal LV size systol function No rwma lvef 59 normal pasp 26mmhg trivial aortic tricuspid regurig aspirin 100 mg prescrib ecg attach her hospit chest apsit result the heart size accur assess appear enlarg there mild promin hilar vessel suggest mild congest she recruit warfarin vs apixaban doubl blind clinic trial start treatment aug4 2009 We later found warfarin w dosag unknown us 14 day wafarin treatment fell caus fall unknown accord friend walk right next mom stop walk forward drop floor hit back head she consciou mobil initi repeat brain CT scan hospit day due drop gcn the second CT scan shown much larger bleed due blood thin effect warfarin she becam semiconsci loss sens control left side CT brain result 1 acut subarachnoid subdur haemorrhag 2 pneumocephalu occipit bone fractur left haemotympanum blood product sphenoid sinu 3 haemorrhag contus left occipit lobe old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleu her inr 35 due warfarin luckili extens rehab abl regain 90 physic mental abil she discharg 911 the blood test sept 14 visit cardiologist haematolog within rang platelet clump note biochemistri non fast within rang non clinic signific On follow visit neurologist leg check neurologist indic doe tendenc embol and brain CT scan done sept discharg hospit show blood clot brain almost gone unlik alzheim her BP 11012080 rang she 3 BP medic one stomach 1 amlodipin besil 10 mg 2 lisinopril 20 mg3 atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 20 mg stomach On 928 cardiologist resum warfarin 1 mgday start despit request leav trial switch aspirin when request echocardiogram dr respons WE need TO DO A transesophag echocardiogram A mildli invas procedur TO detect clot reliabl which IS not feasibl howev even IF NO clot wa seen the risk for clot format IS still present do AN echocardiogram will not chang manag with question 1 given patient neardeath bleed safe continu bloodthin therapi We famili favor use aspirin therapi AF mitig risk thromboembol oppos continu warfarin but given near death brainble use warfarin wise use ani blood thinner even low dose aspirin 2 should patient echocardiogram determin natur extent clot ismay form due AF what type echocardiogram transthorac transesophag what test see upper chamber mother heart help us determin extent build clot therefor help us form evalu true risk profil embol event due AF
133,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I had a kidney stone (6.5 mm) removed via ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy on 11/18/05 because it became lodged at the ureto-vesicular junction after 12 days of excruciating right flank pain (6-8 hrs. per day) as it passed all the way down the right ureter. The day after the surgery; I experienced a different pain in the RUQ of the abdomen extending under and into the rib cage; back; and right shoulder area. I had a contrast helical(spiral) CT scan done on 11/21/05; and everything was normal except for sclerotic lesions found on my 4th and 7th left ribs (opposite side of the pain); which were believed to be bone islands by the radiologist. I had a bone scan done on 12/6/05; which showed two ""hot spots"" on my 10th left rib; which I later found out via a complete skeletal survey and a second reading of the CT scan (as they were not found on the initial read) to be two small sclerotic lesions on the 10th left rib (in addition to two small sclerotic lesions on the 7th left rib; one sclerotic lesion on the 4th left rib; and one sclerotic lesion on the right distal femur). The nuclear medicine physician's report simply stated that the findings were ""suggestive of a benign process"". I had an abdominal ultrasound done on 12/21/05; and the liver; pancreas; and gall bladder were seen as normal; except that a gallstone was found (without ductal dilatation; w/o widening of gall bladder walls; etc. and thus; was adjudged not to be a potential source of my RUQ adominbal/right rib cage pain). As shown below; lab tests were done before surgery (on 11/17/05); on 12/5/05; on 12/19/05; and; finally; on 1/10/06. The reason for the gap between the last two tests was to allow time for the liver enzymes to normalize; as multiple physical exams; CT scan; and abdominal ultrasound seemed to rule out liver; pancreatic; gall bladder; or kidney cancer; and the source of the elevated liver enzymes was hypothesized to be medicine (which was discontinued on 11/25/05). A colonoscopy was done on 11/28/05; and an upper endoscopy was done on 1/4/06; both of which were perfectly normal. Further; the cystoscopy done in conjunction with the ureteroscopy on 11/17/05 seemed to rule out bladder cancer. My PSA level is about 0.8 (ref. range 0-4); and thus; seems to rule out prostate cancer (along with a DRE done by my urologist). My main problem is that I am still experiencing no diminution of my RUQ abdominal/right rib cage/right upper shoulder pain (after almost 2 months); and my liver enzymes became significantly elevated between 11/17/05 and 12/19/05; although they seem to have come down significantly between 12/19/05 and 1/10/06; as seen below (AST down from 53 to 32 (ref. range 3-50 U/L) (ALT down from 209 to 77 (ref. range 3/60 U/L). My principal QUESTION is; in light of the above facts; and the below lab results; can I definitively rule out liver cancer? In this connection; would a liver tumor too small to be detected by CT scan and ultrasound cause the AST and ALT levels to rise significantly from well within normal limits the day before the surgery to well outside of normal limits (at least with respect to the ALT)about a month later (i.e.; from 11/17/05 to 12/19/05); with a significant rise between 11/17/05 and 12/05/05? Would a liver tumor cause the AST and ALT levels to rise as they did in a one month period; and then fall (although the ALT is still mildly elevated) in the next one month period; when they were perfectly normal just prior to the first one month period? Would a liver tumor cause pain before a rise were seen in the AST and ALT levels? Would a liver tumor cause pain without being detectable via ultrasound and helical CT scan? Based on my below lab results; can you provide any explanation as to what may have caused my abnormal LFTs? What recommendations do you have regarding further lab tests; imaging studies; etc.? (BTW: The medications I was given post-surgery were Cipro (2 tablets per day for 6 days; oxycodone 3 5 mg tablets per day for 7 days; and phenazopyridine (2 200mg tablets per day for 3 days). After a severe hypertensive episode on 12/5/05 (180/112 blood pressure); I was prescribed and have been taking ever since; Amlodipine (Norvasc) (1 5 mg tablet per day) and Ramipril (Altace) (1 2.5 mg capsule per day). A CT-Angiogram was also performed on 12/8/05 to rule out renovascular hypertension as the cause of my blood pressure. The findings were normal. Also; several blood and urine tests have been taken to rule out pheochromocytoma; multiple myeloma; and carcinoid tumors. All those tests were negative. 11/17/05: ALT: 32 (reference range 3-60 U/L) AST: 16 (reference range 3-50 U/L) (this was taken one day prior to ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy to remove impacted kidney stone) Alkaline Phosphatase: 82 (ref. range 20-125 U/L)LDH: 171 (100-250 U/L) GGT: 59 (ref. range 3-80 U/L)Cholesterol: 162 (ref. range <200 MG/DL) Triglycerides: 82 (ref. range <150 MG/DL) HDL Cholesterol: 50 (ref. range > 39 MG/DL) LDL Cholesterol: 96 (ref. range 0-100 MG/DL) VLDL Cholesterol: 16 (ref. range 8-40 MG/DL) (CBC;

134,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hello everyone! A quick review of what I know so far. I am a 33 year old obese white male; smoker; with hypertension. I was recently diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. I am on metoprolol; amlodipine and 81mg aspirin. I take simvastatin for my high sensitivity c-reactive protein number (8.9). I was recently given nitrostat for chest pain. This past week; I was put on a 48 hour holter monitor to see; as my cardiologist put it; why I had so many skipped beats. What follows is the narrative: ""Monitoring started at 2:04 pm and continued for 47 hours 59 minutes. Average heart rate was 73 BPM. The minimum heart rate was 39 BPM at 3:38 AM. The maximum heart rate was 136 BPM occuring at 9:05 PM. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 3 beats; of which; 3 were in single PVCs. Ventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of less than one VE per hour. The patients rhythm included 12hr 34 min 34 sec of bradycardia. The slowest single episode of bradycardia occurred at 3:38:19 AM D1; lasting 3 min 53 sec; with minimum heart rate of 39 BPM. The patient's rhythm included 2 hr 10 min 43 sec of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia occurred at 9:04:02 PM D2 lasting 5 min 21 sec; with maximum heart rate of 136 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 1836 beats of which; 39 were in 5 runs; 12 were in atrial couplets; 1545 were single PACs; 7 were in bigeminy; 233 were in trigeminy. There were 2 dropped beats. The longest R-R interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest N-N interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest supraventricular run occurred at 9:49:35 PM D! consisting of 26 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 138 BPM. The fastest supraventricular run occurred at 1:24:33 AM D1; consisting of 3 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 169 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of 38.2 SVEs per hour TECH COMMENTS: Sinus rhythm with episodes of 2nd degree AV block; rates of 39 to 136 BPM. Rare PVCs without VT. Occasional PACs with 5 atrial runs; the longest was 26 beats and the fastest was 169 BPM. No pauses seen. Patient reported symptoms of palpitations and chest pain; which correlated with sinus rhythm. My cardiologist wants to run a sleep study. Obviously the 2nd degree AV block is of the greatest concern. The nurses told me it was of the type 2 variety. My question is that I had a sleep study done 4 years ago and it was negative for sleep apnea. Is a new sleep study warranted at this time?",2010,2012,33.0,Male,,,hello everyon A quick review I know far I 33 year old obes white male smoker hypertens I recent diagnos hypertens cardiomyopathi includ left ventricular hypertrophi left atrial enlarg I metoprolol amlodipin 81mg aspirin I take simvastatin high sensit creactiv protein number 89 I recent given nitrostat chest pain thi past week I put 48 hour holter monitor see cardiologist put I mani skip beat what follow narr monitor start 204 pm continu 47 hour 59 minut averag heart rate 73 bpm the minimum heart rate 39 bpm 338 AM the maximum heart rate 136 bpm occur 905 PM ventricular ectop activ consist 3 beat 3 singl pvc ventricular ectop beat occur rate less one VE per hour the patient rhythm includ 12hr 34 min 34 sec bradycardia the slowest singl episod bradycardia occur 33819 AM D1 last 3 min 53 sec minimum heart rate 39 bpm the patient rhythm includ 2 hr 10 min 43 sec tachycardia the fastest singl episod tachycardia occur 90402 PM D2 last 5 min 21 sec maximum heart rate 136 bpm supraventricular ectop activ consist 1836 beat 39 5 run 12 atrial couplet 1545 singl pac 7 bigemini 233 trigemini there 2 drop beat the longest RR interv 23 second occur 60046 AM D1 the longest NN interv 23 second occur 60046 AM D1 the longest supraventricular run occur 94935 PM D consist 26 beat maximum heart rate 138 bpm the fastest supraventricular run occur 12433 AM D1 consist 3 beat maximum heart rate 169 bpm supraventricular ectop beat occur rate 382 sve per hour tech comment sinu rhythm episod 2nd degre AV block rate 39 136 bpm rare pvc without VT occasion pac 5 atrial run longest 26 beat fastest 169 bpm No paus seen patient report symptom palpit chest pain correl sinu rhythm My cardiologist want run sleep studi obvious 2nd degre AV block greatest concern the nurs told type 2 varieti My question I sleep studi done 4 year ago neg sleep apnea Is new sleep studi warrant time
135,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.",2009,2010,72.0,Female,,,My mom 72 year old femal live singapor diagnos hypertens 8 year ago initi control via wellknown BP medic see medic longer prescrib unknown reason In 509 hospit due methyldopa induc cholestasi diagnos atrial fibril In 809 14 day warfarin therapi fell caus unknown suffer skull fractur caus acut subarachnoid subdur hemorrhag she initi paralyz left side she recov almost 90 3 week On request switch warfarin aspirin In 1209 open cholecystectomi due acut cholecyst pigment gallston In 510 minor stroke her eyesight becam blurri vomit twice lost motor control especi left side she discharg hospit 1 2 day she back warfarin cardiologist recruit apaxiban vs warfarin clinic trial back 809 for 2 3 month 510 stroke mom suffer pain left shoulder make difficult sleep night she alway difficulti fall asleep the new medic simvastatin warfarin seem lessen shoulder pain sadli suffer slowli decreas lucid 809 hospit etiolog uncertain she monitor BP 3 time day upon awaken breakfast around 140 In afternoon even around 120 she take BP medicin breakfast ecg result 409 sinu bradycardia atrial prematur complex 509 AF T abnorm 809 hospit cn hemorrhag sinu rhythm 1009 AF T ST abnorm medic befor 510 stroke 30 amlodipin besyl 5 mg lisinopril 40 mg atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 40 mg aspirin 100 mg medic after 510 stroke simvastatin 10mg warfarin she risk chad 1 1 her stroke symptom indic neuro problem shouldnt neurologist main Dr 2 wa stroke like secondari blood clot ie blockag hemorrhag due capillari wall weak secondari either genet propens vascular wall compromis due long term hypertens how determin what test done 3 should statin drug rather regular timetest BP med like origin BP med list dont statin danger sideeffect what proper treatment regimen shouldnt take BP med statin especi warfarin and arent blood thinner possibl contraind histori could reduct pain shoulder caus antiinflammatori effect statin I read numer articl regard danger statin concern
136,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 60-year old woman; weigh 105 lbs; exercise regularly. I take meds for hypertension and cholesterol and I also take synthroid. About 6 months ago I started a low carb diet for my overall health because heart disease is in my family. I cut out processed foods; bread; white potatoes; pasta; crackers; candy; cereal; desserts. My diet consists of salads with reduced fat dressings; salmon; chicken; tuna; occasional steak; green vegetables; occasional sweet potato; nuts; cottage cheese; greek yogurt and Atkins bars. I recently had a blood test and my fasting blood sugar went from 87 to 96; and my A1C rose from 5.8 to 5.9. I was shocked because my diet has not included simple carbs for the past 6 months. Can you give me some insight as to what may be driving up my fasting gluclose and A1C if I'm not eating high carb foods? I do not cheat on my diet and I exercise 3-4 days per week. I would be happy to adjust my diet again; but I'm at a loss as to what can be causing this.

141,Amlodipine+hypertension,My aunt is now switching from Viread (300mg) to Baraclude (0.5mg). She had been on Viread for about 2 years but her kidney functions have worsened. Our hepatologist and nephrologist think this is happening because of the nephrotoxicity of Viread; which affects some patients. In switching to Baraclude 0.5mg; she is supposed to take Baraclude every other day while still taking Viread everyday for 3 weeks. After that; she'll switch completely to Baraclude. No more Viread. Is this transitioning from Viread to Baraclude typical? On alternate days; she'll be taking full doses of both Viread and Baraclude. Is this not toixc? I understand that some people do combination therapy with the two drugs at full doses simultaneously. But it does surprise me that this is the way to do it.,2009,2012,47.0,Male,,,My aunt switch viread 300mg baraclud 05mg she viread 2 year kidney function worsen our hepatologist nephrologist think happen nephrotox viread affect patient In switch baraclud 05mg suppos take baraclud everi day still take viread everyday 3 week after shell switch complet baraclud No viread Is transit viread baraclud typic On altern day shell take full dose viread baraclud Is toixc I understand peopl combin therapi two drug full dose simultan but surpris way

143,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I was on Prozac 20 years ago for a period of a year for post-natal anxiety disorder....it worked well for me then. I am now 45 years old & on blood pressure meds...I've had a very traumatic few years which resulted in post traumatic stress; panic attacks & claustraphobia. I bacame obsessed that this stress would all make my bp go up again. My doc prescribed xanax to take if & when I need; altho I only take if absolutely neccessary and has then prescribed Prozac for me as I was on it before with no bad side effects...HOWEVER this time it's giving me prickling skin which is very uncomfortable; nightmares; sweating; shaking; very dry mouth & bad tummy upset. I've tried to persevere like she recommended but the side effects aren't lifting....I'm worried that the anxiety of the side affects is actually going to make me worse & not better! I'm also worried that this added anxiety won't help my bp....however I do feel I really need a med that stays in my system long term rather than just a quick fix calmer which is also addictive....any advice would be welcome especially from anyone that may have had similar probs.

146,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; ""Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis""; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record.

147,Amlodipine+hypertension,My poor girl Zola has been lethargic and disinterested in her kibble off and on this month. Two nights ago I bought a bag of a different food to see if she would try it. I mixed it with some old food and she ate the whole bowl right away. That was around 6 pm. I work grave shift so I got home Saturday morning and took her out to potty. Her eyes were both covered by the lower eyelid membrane and she seemed disoriented; and confused. I helped her find her way back inside and tried to calm her down as she was trembling. When I checked her gums they were very pale. I've never seen this; so I rushed her off to the vet. She perked up some (she loves car rides) but had an accident there.VET diagnosed her with renal failure... Creatine was supposed to be 1.8 and hers is 8.1. The BUN number was supposed to be under 29 and she's at a 90. I'm terrified. She has blood in herurine and the protein Is high. Vet gave her an IV catheter and sent her home with me to return in the morning. At pickup She was prescribed Hills Prescription Diet k/d and some aluminum hydroxide gel to take with it to keep her phosphorous levels down. She hates the syringe of the gel; but ate the canned Hills with vigor so that was promising! She spent last night curled up on the couch with us. She enjoyed her new food again this morning and her stool was a better consistency. At 9:00 AM today Zola returned to the vet for more IV fluids as planned. They re ran bloodwork and also checked her electrolyte levels to see where her numbers were. She stayed at the vet all day receiving fluids. She threw up once and had a little diarrhea there. Her numbers haven't improved. She will return tomorrow for another round of fluids and tests. I am so worried and not ready to make any decisions. I know the vet is doing everything they can.

148,Amlodipine+hypertension,A recent paper studied the effect of most FDA approved drugs on the inhibition of NTCP; the now known entry receptor for HBV. Ezetimibe was found to have a 50%inhibition conc of 25micromolar; while irbesartan; a commonly used angiotensin inhibitor to reduce blood pressure; was found to inhibit at 11.9 micromolar. Both compounds have similar MW; but irbesartan is given at up to 300mg per day; while exetimibe is dosed at 10mg. Thus the combination of 30fold higher approved dose and the double micromolar inhibition potency makes; in theory; irbesartan 60 fold more potent to inhibit Hbv entry. Of course; binding of these drugs to plasma proteins could cause substsntial differences in the available concentration on the hepatocyte membrane receptor; and the pharmacokinetics could further influence the in vivo efficscy. Tests in chimeric mice are urgently needed to determine the in vivo efficacy of this common; mostly beneficial medication on HBV reinfection inhibition.,2011,2013,,Male,,,A recent paper studi effect fda approv drug inhibit ntcp known entri receptor hbv ezetimib found 50inhibit conc 25micromolar irbesartan commonli use angiotensin inhibitor reduc blood pressur found inhibit 119 micromolar both compound similar MW irbesartan given 300mg per day exetimib dose 10mg thu combin 30fold higher approv dose doubl micromolar inhibit potenc make theori irbesartan 60 fold potent inhibit hbv entri Of cours bind drug plasma protein could caus substsntial differ avail concentr hepatocyt membran receptor pharmacokinet could influenc vivo efficsci test chimer mice urgent need determin vivo efficaci common mostli benefici medic hbv reinfect inhibit
149,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Dear Doctor; I am writing to you seeking for some practical advice; and I hope you can help me. I have outlined the problems as detailed as I can; and have included all drug (brand names in parenthesis); in case of cross-country differences. *** Hypertension; Tachycardia: I am now 22 years old; and 2 years ago; during a regular medical check-up; the gynaecologist found that I had a resting blood pressure of 140/90. Was a regular blood donor for 3 years (and on holiday); so the BP-spike was an anomaly. She subsequently refered me a to physician-neurologist. An ABPM was done; and the highest reading of BP was 158/128. Tachycardia was another feature on the ABPM (with HR as high as 160; not-under-strenous-activity). Note: No feeling of anxiousness during the high heart rate. I have very minimal family history of HTN (parents have slightly elevated bp; after age 45); am active; have a BMI of 21; and borderline Cholesterol. Have been through the mill for ALL tests to check for secondary HTN; and the only abnormality is high (sitting upright for half an hour) renin at 17.0 (Range: 0.2-2.8); although Aldosterone was normal. Doppler U/S and Renal MRA showed no Renal Artery Stenosis. Am now on Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg; Valsartan (Diovan) 160 mg; Propranolol (Inderal) 80 mg; all once daily. Doctors are ambivalent about diagnosis: Some belief it is essential HTN; while some belief we just havent hit the nail on the head. *** Tremors: A few months after that; I developed severe tremors of my hands; and when fatigued; of the legs as well; to the extent I cannot walk. I cannot write properly unless with medication (I am on Propranolol; 80 mg; once daily) as my hands will tremble and I have to grip my pen tightly in order to maintain penmanship; as my hands also feel weak (only confined to fine motor movement like writing; using a tweezer etc). My eyelids and lips also occasionally tremble (thyroid function normal). There are also occasions every day when individual appendages and digits twitch for no reason (kinda like a sudden jerk?). *** Problems emptying bladder: 3 months ago; I started having problems with my bladder; where I had to visit the bathroom a few times before I 'finished'. I also have problem initiating urine flow despite the bladder feeling heavy; and have perisistent dribbling at the end. The bladder problem became troublesome when I kept waking up at night. I initially thought I was having a urinary tract infection; but urinalysis showed no bacteria. Two pre+post-micturition Ultrasounds were done; the first showed incomplete emptying (bladder at that time was very full); while the second (a bladder which was quite empty) showed complete emptying. Note: Blood/Urine sugar consistently normal. I also realise that at the peak of my urinary activity (when I keep going to the toilet every half an hour); I have a lot of saliva pooling in my mouth; at the bottom (the rest of my mouth feels very dry); and I have to consciously remind myself to swallow. *** Haywire Blood Pressure; when ill: A month ago; I was admitted for an acute nasopharyngitis+otitis media+severe migraine. During hospitalisation; I was given Oxymethazoline Hydrochloride (Afrin) to clear the nasal congestion and IV-Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Early the next morning; my BP dropped to a surprising 70/40 (without anti-Hypertensives). I was not purging; or vomiting; and had maintained normal fluid intake. The BP stubbornly refused to climb despite the administration of IV-fluids; and I remained in hospital for 4 days. (Note: Doctor ordered me to off all anti-Hypertensives; and one week later; my BP went up to (the highest) 177/135)) *** Pupillary Reflex: Upon discharge; I collapsed at home; which the doctor diagnosed as vasovagal. Upon examination; she found that my pupils were strangely more dilated than normal (to penlight and accommodation); in absence of pain. I was refered to a Opthalmologist; who found no problems; using his ""super torchlight"" (he didn't use a penlgiht). The first doctor thinks there is still cause for concern; because my pupils used to constrict properly (to penlight and accommodation); and she has been my physician for the past 3 years. For a few years; I have had a problem focusing when I read (if for a long time) books/articles/passages etc wtih small print. I find that my central vision will suddenly disappear (peripheral vision is intact); and I have problems when reading from line to line (like the vision jumps). My prescription lens power has been checked yearly and they have remained at the same level. Is it possibly caused by accommodation problems? *** Differential Diagnosis: My physician has put a few things into the basket of possible differential diagnosis; and I am wiritng to you to ask if you have encountered anything even remotely similar to my case. Among the condition my physician suspects (subject to further discussion) are: 1) Idiopathic Pandysautonomia 2) Idiopathic Dysautonomia 3) (Purely Autonomic) CIDP My physician admits she isn't very familiar with these conditions as she has yet to see a full-blown case in practise. .. She suspects my immune system is always active. I have been 'plagued' with recurrent acute tonsilitis for years (leading to the eventual removal after going into a near-Quinsy emergency in 2006) and now without my tonsils I get other infections of the upper respiratory tract; have also had recurrent allergies which attack my eyes; ears; nose; skin since young. She thinks it is worthwhile doing an LP to check for oligoclonal bands. One note of interest: I had measles at the age of 9 months (to which the pediatrician said I did not need the MMR vaccination; since I had measles); mumps at 14 years old; and received my Rubella-vaccination at the age of (I think) 15. I read somewhere that the measles virus can remain dormant in the body for years and come back and wreck havoc years later. Is that true? *** Pressing Question: 1) Is there a reason for us to continue looking for an answer to my problems; and if yes; are we along the right path? I don't believe I am stressed out with life and neither does my physician or family; but is stress a possible factor in all the above symptoms? I am open to the possibility =) *** I know this letter is very long; and I thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you.

151,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 25 years old and very healthy. I am not overweight; I work out regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke. For the past 3 months I have been having severe swelling in my left foot and ankle. At times the swelling continues into my calf and causes a discomfort. I first noticed the swelling after I got home from the gym one evening. I took my shoe off and my foot was huge for no reason. I have not had any injuries; insect bites or infections. The first doctor I went to took x-rays which came back normal and ran a CBC which also came back completely normal. He told me I would just have to live with the swelling and wrote a Rx for Lasik PRN to help. The Lasik does help when I take it but as soon as I stop taking it the swelling comes right back. I've been told not to take it long term as it can effect important vitamin levels. I wasn't ready to just treat the symptoms and live with it so I went to an Internist who took me off birth control pills thinking it could be hormones but the swelling continued. She then sent me for a venous doppler test which also came back normal. She is sending me for an untrasound of the heart tomorrow. If the heart tests come back normal what else could be causing this unexplained swelling? It is only in the left foot/ankle and pitts for about 30 seconds when pushed on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with a diasnosis? I am afraid that I'm at the end of the road with tests and the doctors can't seem to figure out what is causing this swelling in a young; healthy person.

152,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat? I am wating to see an electrophysiologist for an EP study to see what is going on. My hope is that this can be corrected quickly. I am taking metroporal and asprin daily.

153,Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a scheduled ablation this Friday. I was diagnosed with SVT and I didn't even know I had it. I get a lot of palpitations and I am currently on 25mg of beta blocker x2 a day. I want to know if the ablation is worth it. Will it get rid of my palpitations? The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23). I think I had an SVT once and that was a year ago playing basketball; I came down from a shot and landed hard and my heart started beating fast and weird and I couldn't control it.

154,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying ""well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous"" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this.

155,Amlodipine+hypertension,For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches.

157,Amlodipine+hypertension,"There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the ""spot"" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?",2008,2008,,Male,,,there sever us similar eye complaint see bright flash like afterimag flash bulb blink sometim upgaz thi transient symptom us last anywher day week when spot visual field pass dark background spot appear light when spot pass light background appear dark So far doctor havent abl diagnos us perhap mean simpli idiopath phenomenon but case Im wonder similar might could bring us closer explan for instanc factor might clue I take 100 mg zoloft day I would describ highanxieti stress I clench teeth usual side effect eye I alot sinu problem around eye I doubl vision due weak muscl one eye I mani floater one promin one eye without bright spot how
158,Amlodipine+hypertension,Not sure where to post this. A few days ago I had a sensation of the floor vibrating under one foot. Since then I have realized it is my foot. It is felt in bloth feet; one at a time. Never both at the same time. I feel it when I am standing r walking. It is like an intermittent buzzing sensation. It comes in short bursts on after the other then stops. It will happen when walking and I will feel it with every third or fourth step. What could be the cause?

159,Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past 4 years I have been experiencing horrible symptoms. It seemed that the whole thing started as a sinus infection but then I went for a CT scan of sinuses and they were clear. I have been having symptoms of dizziness; head pain; shakiness and a spaced out kind of foggy feeling like i am watching my life from the outside - all day every day. There are some times for a couple of hours during the day that the symptoms may lift and give me a few moments to live- but not much. I have been to about 30 doctors- including ENT's allergists; neurologists; chiropracters; opthamologists. psychologists; dentists and everything else u can think of. All CT scans; MRI of brain and blood work keep coming back clean and ok. Nothing I try seems to work. There was a period of time about 3 and a half years ago that the symptoms lifted for about 4 months and then it returned full force. Some of the weird parts are that the shakiness seems to be seasonal - coming in spring and lasting thru summer and its miserable like a tingling pins and needles sensation thru out my body. I have also been getting what some doctors seem to diagnose as recurring sinus infections- like 10 a year- i take anti biotics and i feel slightly better until the next infection but i still have the other symtoms while I am on the medication. I have hay fever and allergies to mold dust...Every doctor tried diagnosing something different- like migraines or TMJ or some sort of other odd thing. I've tried tons of medications. I dont usually have all the symptoms at once...they kind of take turns. One doctor suggested moving to Arizona as it may be a sinus issue but the ENT's say I have no sinus isue- just regular allergies and the allergists say that they have never seen symptoms like these for allergies. I tried psychologists even though the ony reason I am stressed out is cuz I can never live....before this sickness I was the happiest person around- and even psychologists turned me away as normal. Is there anyone out there that may know something that can help me - please??......I can not go on like this anymore,2007,2007,,,,,for past 4 year I experienc horribl symptom It seem whole thing start sinu infect I went CT scan sinus clear I symptom dizzi head pain shaki space kind foggi feel like watch life outsid day everi day there time coupl hour day symptom may lift give moment live much I 30 doctor includ ent allergist neurologist chiropract opthamologist psychologist dentist everyth els u think all CT scan mri brain blood work keep come back clean ok noth I tri seem work there period time 3 half year ago symptom lift 4 month return full forc some weird part shaki seem season come spring last thru summer miser like tingl pin needl sensat thru bodi I also get doctor seem diagnos recur sinu infect like 10 year take anti biotic feel slightli better next infect still symtom I medic I hay fever allergi mold dusteveri doctor tri diagnos someth differ like migrain tmj sort odd thing ive tri ton medic I dont usual symptom oncethey kind take turn one doctor suggest move arizona may sinu issu ent say I sinu isu regular allergi allergist say never seen symptom like allergi I tri psychologist even though oni reason I stress cuz I never livebefor sick I happiest person around even psychologist turn away normal Is anyon may know someth help pleasei go like anymor

Creatine was 13-subs at home-now using hollistic and homepatic treatment. Recently more bad days than good. I am giving her ice chips which seem to work better for her than lapping. Pedialyte ice is also better. She throws up until she staggers and falls-I am continuously trying to hydrate her and giving her baby food-At times; she is able to keep it down; other times the vomiting is horrible. She continues to try for us; and we are fighting so hard for her-LIke others; I tuck her in at night (she sleeps on the loveseat with her ""bankie"" covering her). I am sleeping in the den with her so I can give her support throughout the night. Neither of us are getting much sleep. I have her spoiled now with hand feeding other than her baby food; and I hold her plate while she licks it up. I am using a recipe of egg yellow / whites; honey; and whole yogurt with a touch of dry powdered milk. This works sometimes. Sandy Grace is not ready to leave us-she continues to try-we try for her twenty-four hours a day. Is there any over the counter medication that I can give her that will help with her vomiting?

162,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 73 year old male that has elevated BP in the pulmonary artery. Started out in early 2011 with a heart murmur; echo measured pressure was 38.4; repeat echo in about 6 months; pressure was 39. Recent echo last 2 weeks (2/6/13) was 40. I have no outward signs such as dizziness; SOB; fatigue. My peripheral BP runs about 125-135/55-70. My question is; I know the numbers are abnormal but how abnormal? Is a rise of 1.6mm of Hg in 2 years significant? How high of a number is considered severe. I have just been put on diltiazem CD 120 daily with a repeat echo in 6 months. Should I just wait and see what happens or should I be considering a more aggressive approach? I've read all the data on life expectancy and it's not good.

163,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,70.0,Male,,,I male 70 year age I 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 thi control BP within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 My doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 My concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level Do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead I tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret
164,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise.

165,Diltiazem+hypertension,At my request; my family physician has agreed to change my medication from daily metoprolol extended release 100 mg to daily diltiazem 120 mg.

168,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real ""symptoms"" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the ""silent killer"". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its ""gentle"". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now.

170,Diltiazem+hypertension,In the last two weeks I have had four episodes of AFIB. The first in two years landed me in the Hospital. My meds were changed from Metoprolol to Diltiazem 360 mg per day and Fleconade 50 mg 2x per day plus Warfarin. The Metoprolol 25mcg 1 x daily has been making me wheeze for the past four years; but no one ever thought to change the meds. I have been on this new med protocol for 1.5 weeks. I just started the Fleconide and Warfarin three days ago. My question is I need to loose 45 pounds asap. I am doing very well eating 1000 Kcal per day with a small abount or carbs (under 25) and otherwise lots of green vegetables and fish (Salmon only once a week) ; then some extra lean turkey. Really feel great with the diet. But I started moderate exercise as soon as I was released from the Hospital. I walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.5mph then I do various lite weight lifting (Nautilus rocker equipment) I have lost 10 lbs since my Hospital visit. But i have also had three episodes of AFIB while the Diltiazem was being increased. EchoCardiogram and Chemical Stress test shows zero blockages or other heart problems. I have the approval of the Cardiologist to go back to the gym and moderately exercise. I have quickly become addicted to the exercise and the diet. I am afraid of the Fleconide; afraid of the AFIB and BP 130/86 avg. Pulse is down to 60 ( was 80 - 110) resting. So I am afraid of exercise. I just need advice.

177,Diltiazem+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate.

179,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report. Third echo since Nov 04; this at PHClinic; normal left 'side' at rest incl RV size and function. Est. RV S.Pressure; 32 mmHg (BP 158/90) inc. to 60 mmHg (BP 184/82)at peak exercise(supine bike).

There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'.

180,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and am taking Cartia XT 240mg for pulmonary hypertension; aspirin and Lovenox due to antiphospholipid antibodes; prilosec; and 30mg of Cortef daily for adrenal insufficiency; which is slightly higher than replacement dose to simultaneously treat my autoimmune disease. Also; prior to the pregnancy I was taking 200mg of plaquenil twice daily; as well as 1200mg of Ibuprofen; for undifferentiated connective tissue disease. I will likely have to restart plaquenil and ibuprofen after the pregnancy if my autoimmune disease flares; which is likely. I was wondering about taking this combination of medications while breastfeeding. The Lovenox will be dropped; but all of the others will continue. There seems to be conflicting data about the safely of taking calcium channel blockers while breastfeeding; in particular. Many sites warn against taking Cartia XT sustained release capsules while breastfeeding; based on the results of certain studies that show a substantial amount passes through to the breastmilk; yet some experts seem to think it's okay. What would you recommend to a patient like me. I really don't want to continue to continue to expose the baby to multiple medications; especially the diltiazem; if not necessary.

181,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests.

183,Diltiazem+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above.

184,Diltiazem+hypertension,Currently being treated for extensive multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms with Xarelto. Hypertension is not being controlled adequately with Lisinoprol 20mg BID. Runs around 147/93 pulse 104 while sitting. They had me taking metropolol 25mg BID on top of the Lisinopril; but had to discontinue due to abdominal cramping; diarrea and major depressive mood swing; confusion and just a general feeling of being in a fog.

186,Diltiazem+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement.

188,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello; Thank you;I really appreciate you taking my question. The cardiologist I currently see was unable to see me after the cath so had to be seen by the nurse practioner.I was told need to stay on current meds clonidine;diltiazem;traim/hctz;diovan metoprolol;minoxidil) The first cardio seen said that we were running out of options.I have tried every class of medication I'm max'd out on beta blockers;do to asthma;max'd on ARB's and Calcium channel blockers.I take a diuretic;told increasing that would probably help very little.I could not tolerate Ace inibitors and Central acting blockers;(Tenex and Catpres patch because of allergies)the clonidine tablets;I'm taking now have been causing me problems;but because I was told my option were running out; i continue to take them.I was told could take Hydralazine;or Aldomet;but both require taking 3-4 times daily.was told could go up on the minoxidil.i refused did not like the side effects. I've been checked for secondary causes;except Pheochromocytoma; told rare and not likley;should this be ruled out? I recently had surgery and had problems with blood pressure dropping to low(80/30)and breathing problems;shortness of breath when walking oxygen sat would drop to low;could this be from all the meds?

I started having severe chest pain about a year ago and underwent a cardiac stress test; cardiac cath; in which the cardiologist feels that I have a nutcracker esophogus along with some leaking valves; hypertension. The stress showed some ischemia and hence the cardiac cath but that was normal. He prescribed nitro for the chest pain along with taking toprol xl; lotrel to control the htn; and he couldn't rule out coronary spasms all together but with my history of esophogitis; gerds;ulcers etc.. he feels that this is the best treatment. I also see a internist who recently did a EGD and found that I did not have Barrett's esophogus but some scarring and inflammation. I go through this every few months with the spasms; the intense reflux; abdominal pain etc.. I wind up off work for several days because I can't get it under control. How do I do this? I am tired of going through this every time I turn around. I have changed my eating habits; my sleep habits; also tried to decrease my stress level which is difficult since I work in critical care.

192,Diltiazem+hypertension,My question is what does 'lung bases not well visualized' mean? In 2004 I was diagnosed with exercise-induced PH by a specialist in the field; and this was put down as being due to my high blood pressure being uncontrolled. My PAP at the time was 78. The next year I had another opinion with another very well-respected PH specialist; and he told me that he did not agree with the first diagnosis. I now see a cardiologist in the small town where I live; and my PAP at the latest echo was 31. I am 63; my medication is diltiazem; lisinopril; maxide and an aspirin. I don't and have never smoked. I exercise. But; I still have breathing problems and wonder if this is due to some of the medication; or whether there is some problem with my lungs. Thank you.

193,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I recently had a right heart cath due to continuing symptoms of shortness of breath; chest pain on exertion; cold/tingly hands; swelling in ankles; fatigue (especially on stairs); ""foggy"" thinking episodes; pounding heartbeat at times. The results were a bit confusing to me and the doc didn't discuss much of it over the phone. All I have are a limited set of the test results as follows: PA Pressure - 88.9; Cardiac Output - 16.2; SBP - 150. When talking to him over the phone he mentioned that I had really high cardiac output and highly oxygenated blood in the lungs (meaning it shouldn't be that oxygenated yet). It's a couple weeks till I see him. Any thoughts on what could be going on?

I also have recently had spotting several days of the month about a week after my ""normal"" period. I am in my 20's; not currently sexually active.

Could medication which I take for hypertension and SVT/NSVT (propafenone; diltiazem and triazide) have any effect on menstrual cycles? 3.

I don't drink; smoke; or do any kind of illegal drugs. All symptoms listed on previous post were conveyed to the cardiologist I'm seeing.

I'm afraid to take anything else. I was told I have essential Hypertension. With the information listed above; what else could be done? The beta blockers seem to work best on keeping the blood pressure down. However I'm told people with asthma should not take them. Q.How exactly do beta blockers cause problems for asthmatics? What is a similiar drug; that could be used in it's place? I feel like my concerns are not being addressed. Maybe I'm not asking enough questions or the right questions. Q.

199,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to ""white coat syndrome""; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9"" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event"" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour.

As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP.

200,Diltiazem+hypertension,Since the beginning of January I; have been intermittently tachycardic (HR 95-120; generally 2-3 times a day); hypertensive (running anywhere from 170/110-220/140); nauseated; flushing (dry flushing; lasting anywhere from several minutes to 24 hours; present on face; neck; chest; and arms); and intermittent low grade temperatures (99.0-100.5). Initially was thought to have influenza; but no swab done. Then ?bacterial infection; course of antibiotics with no improvement. Continuing symptoms with no change. Visited ER multiple times and received IV fluids; which did not improve tachycardia or hypertension as it generally does with dehydration. Sepsis workup was negative; CT scan chest negative as well as chest x-ray. CT abdomen/pelvis did reveal a focal lesion on the liver; and small nonspecific inguinal lymph nodes. Follow-up MRI finding was focal fat left hepatic lobe. Normal appearing adrenal glands and pancreas. Prior to January I never had any history of hypertension or flushing. Flashback to Feb 2010... I had a mediastinal mass resection that pathology came back as benign thymic tissue. Had experienced tachycardia 4 months prior to resection and was hospitalized; sinus tachycardia 130's and ended up on diltiazem drip (avoided beta blockers due to asthma history). No mass on CT at that time! Had not experienced any further tachycardia since that then. July 2010 left thyroid nodule discovered on US and FNA completed...indeterminate; too few cells. This was followed by 2 ultrasounds 6 months apart with no change. It was decided at that point that no further follow-up was needed. This was at Mayo… Back to present...Echocardiogram completed the end of January was normal. We did end up starting diltiazem CD 180 mg with absolutely no improvement in tachycardia or hypertension. Spironolactone initiated 50 mg twice daily; minimal improvement. Performed 24 hour urine for metanephrine/catecholamine...negative; I don't have the specific values from this. Also performed 5-HIAA at that time; which was negative. Phone consult with endocrinology by my primary MD came up with ?carcinoid. Chromagranin-A was negative as well as tryptase. Dexamethasone suppression test completed 3 times; slightly elevated (2.4; should be =0); Prolactin 1.3 (5.2-26.5); Calcitonin <5.0 (<8). May 2; I had surgery. When I woke up in recovery it was like someone flipped a switch. No nausea and no flushing at all!!!! Blood pressures and heart rate still elevated. Also had horrendous pain at the incision site that we could not get controlled. Once we got home; I continued to have really bad pain for a couple weeks (cheeks would flush with pain only; and stop once improved). Blood pressures and heart rate began venturing back down to 140/80-160/100 (not good; but definitely a major improvement from prior to surgery). Continued to not have any nausea or flushing. Pathology came back as benign adenoma. I continued to be the one in a million patient and ended up with an infection in my incision; an allergic reaction to mederma; and a myositis in the muscles on the RIGHT side of my neck…but still no flushing; nausea; tachycardia; etc. My body had every reason to have those symptoms; but didn’t! 3 weeks later all of my symptoms came back with a vengeance..blood pressures; heart rate; flushing; nausea; palpitations…EVERYTHING!! At that point; meds were the same dosages. Blood pressures much more resistant to medications this time. Have had to titrate meds up a lot. Diltiazem stopped; labetolol started (200 mg twice daily). Had to decrease it due to near syncopal episodes; but interestingly enough; I never had a low blood pressure even with spells. Currently on Labetolol 100 mg twice daily; Clonidine 0.2 mg three times daily; Spironolactone 25 mg twice daily; and Lasix 20 mg daily. Even with this regimen am very routinely running blood pressures 170/100-210/130! Heart rates finally 80-95. Other symptoms basically the same. TSH was 1.65 in Jan; 0.8 in June; and 1.77 last week (reference range 0.36-3.74); FT4 0.79 (0.76-1.46) and T3 130 (80-200) last week. So; here is where things sit as of today. My gut feeling is that this is thyroid; even though labs are normal and have been the entire time. It seems really strange that after surgery; for a full 3 weeks; all symptoms were improved. Then; at the 3-4 week mark when you can start to figure out if the remaining thyroid will take over full function; symptoms came back. We already know that there are cysts on the remaining right lobe. It is also interesting that I was nauseated and had no appetite prior to surgery and gradually lost some weight over 5 months. In the immediate 1 month post-op period; I lost 15 pounds without trying; and eating high calorie; high protein; small meals. I asked the surgeon if we should have removed the entire thyroid. He can see where I'm coming from and can see the reasoning behind it. He told me he can see a huge difference from before surgery; to after; and to now! Also is willing to take the other half out; but endocrinology is adamant that this will not help flushing and hypertension issues. They also can't explain why symptoms went away or why they came back…or what they were from in the first place. Next Wednesday I have a consult with the surgeon that trained my surgeon. If he has seen anything like this or can see my rationale; he will give the go ahead for surgery. I'm at my wits end and just want to feel better and have my life back. I feel like my surgeon is the only one pulling for me aside from my primary doc. My gut is that this has to be done to prove one way or another. I have sat down with my main endocrinologist and had a consult with another. In very clear terms I explained what I think is going on. I told them that they have to take a step back from their numbers and doctor hat. They have to be able to look at things from the patient perspective. Ultimately this is my body and that counts for something. I'm the one living this miserable; scary reality. The really frustrating thing is that my primary doc; who is wonderful; doesn't even know what to do for meds for BP anymore. He asks what endocrinology think; who in return; don't really seem to be concerned with the situation or finding a fix. I'm stuck in the middle and just want to feel better. I do have a cardiology consult in August; but truly think that if we take the other half of the thyroid out that we won't need it. Does my thinking make sense to anyone else? Any feedback would be truly appreciated!

202,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 36 years old male; I have been in permanent atrial fibrillation now for about 3 years. I have had all the tests multiple times and there is no cause. I was finally able to se a good Cardiologist; He tells me that he will try to return my heart back to normal rhythm But he has told me that it is probably to late and that this should of been done a couple of years ago. He is going to try a drug effective in maintaining sinus rhythm; Electrical cardioversion and consider Ablation procedure but he has already told me that these procedures may not work because I have been in permanent atrial fibrillation to long. I am currently on Diltiazem 360mg ; Warfarin 5mg; and Clonazepam 1mg (when necessary). If nothing else works what’s next?

203,Diltiazem+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times. I cannot take beta blockers and have lisinopril 10mg and dilitiazem 120mg daily.,2007,2007,60.0,Female,,,last year untreat BP 200110 1086513485 time howev yesterday I lot stress work start get similar chest pain I exert central pressur go neck continu mildli 30 minut My BP 157100 In end I use gtn spray clear pain thi morn work 15393 go 13484 lunch I mild chest discomfort present work pressur BP 13891 Do I need worri spike like caus pain stress someth I live I know level hypertens base rest level work level rest If med adjust may drop lower relax time I take beta blocker lisinopril 10mg dilitiazem 120mg daili

205,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 30 year old restaurant owner who started having problems about 3 months ago. I started getting dizzy and short of breat at work. My hear would also race and I would feel like I'm about to pass out. My doctor refferred me to have an echo done. It showed moderate mitral valve and aortic valve regurgitation. I have been feeling signifigantly worse to the point that I haven't worked in a month. My cardiologist has tried covera hs 180; and 240 which didn't work and I am now on dilitziam 180 mg which has also not worked. I am in agony yet my cardiologist acts like I should learn to deal wit it. He doesn't seem to understand my symptoms are severe. Don't you think that he ought to be doing other tests???

206,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down on the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit. The only time I feel okay is when my sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated- exercise; emotion; etc. but when that wears off; I get unable to drive or walk around as my brain does not seem to get enough oxygen with the low heart rate from pvcs.

207,Diltiazem+hypertension,I recently experienced an outbreak of (genital); herpes the third in about two months. I went to the doctor with the first outbreak and the MD said that it was an abcess. As I was told over 25 years ago that I had herpes; I did not take this any further; though the MD suggesting opening the abcess. This was my first visit to an MD in all these years. However; with this last episode; it seems that the herpes had spread inside my anus and was terribly painful; this along with general malaise; pain in my left groin and fever. It has taken about two weeks to recover. My question.

208,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at?

209,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion.

211,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello everyone. Just happened to come across this site when searching for more information on PVCs and Mitral Valve Prolapse. Wanted to share my story as well. Thursday night after Thanksgiving dinner; I started noticed PVCs about every couple of minutes or so. I didn't think much of it since I'd just ate a big dinner and thought it might be indigestion. Then Friday rolls around; and still feeling the PVCs every few minutes. Saturday night I decided to visit the ER since I've never had this happen before. Usually I feel them a few times a day at most. The doctor ran some tests; did a chest xray; and hooked me up to an EKG. After about 8 hours; they said the xrays and heart enzyme tests looked fine and no stress seemed present for my heart. The PVCs were very clear on the EKG to them; so they recommended that I contact my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist for follow up. Naturally; I was freaked out completely; but I do take some comfort in reading the posts on this site and seeing that there are others like me that share similar symptoms of PVCs lasting all day (and far beyond). Since this is a new journey for me; are there any questions I should have ready for the cardiologist? Any tests I should ask for?

212,Diltiazem+hypertension,Had a ablation for wpw 10 days ago. EP said it is completely gone (normal EKG) few days after I had double heart rate that lasted about 2 min. Then went back to normal. Im tired and get out of breath sometimes.. Heart rate also goes up when walking goes back in the 70-80s resting. Im 62 and do take meds for high bloodpressure. Dr. Changed my blood pressure med. to cartia xt after I had a bad svt attack that put me in the hospital hoping that the meds would calm my heart down (on this med. I was feeling tired and out of breath at times . ) one this meds. I had another attack-dr. Sent me to see a EP he found the problem right away. There was a cancelation and the following week went in for the ablation. Like i said above everything went fine. Not due to go for follow up in a month; ive talked to his head nurse and she said that it was normal for the heart to act up after ablation; that it just takes time. But I was wondering if maybe the meds that im on is the reason that im tired and out of breath since that was going on before the ablation.? Im just not feeling great. Has anyone else felt this way. I know its only been 10 days but I work 40 hours a week and feel lousy all day!,2015,2015,61.0,Female,,,had ablat wpw 10 day ago EP said complet gone normal ekg day I doubl heart rate last 2 min then went back normal Im tire get breath sometim heart rate also goe walk goe back 7080 rest Im 62 take med high bloodpressur Dr chang blood pressur med cartia xt I bad svt attack put hospit hope med would calm heart med I feel tire breath time one med I anoth attackdr sent see EP found problem right away there cancel follow week went ablat like said everyth went fine not due go follow month ive talk head nurs said normal heart act ablat take time but I wonder mayb med im reason im tire breath sinc go ablat Im feel great ha anyon els felt way I know 10 day I work 40 hour week feel lousi day
213,Diltiazem+hypertension,"35 yo M; previously in good health. Cholesterol OK (170s) and bp 120s/70s. My father and his mother developed high bp in late 50s. No other history of heart trouble. I've recently developed heart rhythm probs. For last 2 months; I've had episodes when my HR races upon mild exertion. 1st visit to cardiologist occurred the same day as I was having symptoms. The EKG in office was normal. But a stress test showed HR quickly at 200. The doctor diagnosed SVT/atrial flutter and put me on 50mg Troprol and 325mg aspirin. I've had progressively longer episodes during which HR might race. During these; my resting HR is 90s and upon mild exertion HR rises to 180s. Sitting down or just standing still causes the HR to fall back to resting rate. High HR lasts only for a short time. The alternative “mode” for heart is normal. The resting HR is 65-75. During extended moderate exertion; HR rises to 110s. Further visits to the cardiologist occurred during this mode and my EKGs were normal. I had catheter ablation last week. Doctor found three irregular rhythms:1 main & 2 extra. The rhythms switched irregularly between the three. The two extra rhythms were short-lived and came from the left atrium. Despite this; main rhythm was treated but other 2 were not (too short lived). Two days after procedure; heart switched over to the ""fast"" mode and it has been there since then. Doc wants to wait and see what happens. While this is somewhat unsatisfactory; I understand the need to get a better handle on how often my symptoms occur; their nature; whether medication might help. 1)Is the Toprol worthwhile?

214,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

215,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 33 Yr Lady diagnoised of Vasculitis(Small Vessel) at the age of 12 manifested as skin lesions. In the year 2002 I was admitted to hospital with hypertension & chest pain. A stress thalium was positive following which a coronory agiogram was negative. I was put on diltiazem tablets which I tolerated well and my symptoms reduced considerably. Few months back my BP dropped following which my diltazem dose was made half(90 SR mg once a day). I then developed chest pain & breathlessness on excersion which relieves on rest. My cardiaologist has now put me on an additional cardiac drug vastarel 35 mg twice a day.

216,Diltiazem+hypertension,(This was also posted in expert forum last night.) I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down in the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit.

217,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries ""clamped down"" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and ""improper"" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial. I had no insurance when I had the heart attack (husband was out of work and just got a new job) and there is a 9 month waiting period for anything pre-existing...

218,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 53 yo man diagnosed ~8 years ago with lone paroxysmal atrial flutter and afib. Long term history of endurance sports but nothing outrageous - running 20 miles a week since my teens. Episodes are generally less than an hour; but frequent - typically one every day or couple of days. Have been trying a ""pill in a pocket"" appproach - that is; I will take some metoprolol (50 mg tablet) if the tachycardia lasts more than 5 minutes. Usually the episode will end 10-20 minutes after taking the medication. I have taken a Ca channel blocker (diltiazem) in the past; but that did not seem effective. So here's the question. The beta and calcium channel blockers as you of course know are referred to as ""rate control"" medications; yet they don't do a thing to my heart rate while I am in afib or flutter (though the beta blocker does reduce my resting heart rate when not in tachycardia; the Ca blocker not so much.) But the beta blocker does seem to reduce the length of the episodes compared to how long they last if I just let it go; so this seems to be some sort of rhythm control. (And again; the Ca blocker does not seem to be effective at this either; which is why it is a former medication.) Is my experience with these medications common in your experience - that is; some rhythm control but little effective rate control? Is there something about the metoprolol specifically that separates it from the other beta blockers? (""membrane stabilizing effect?"")

219,Diltiazem+hypertension,HI; i'm a 20 year old female in college. I have recently (in the past year) been treated for SVT by having a cardiac ablation. However; my heart rhythm issues have continued. I have hypertension and general anxiety. I think the anxiety is more so linked to not knowing whats wrong with my heart. My heart rate is out of control. Resting it can go from 70-120. When I simply walk to class it will be about 140. My doctor has put me on 240 mg of diltiazem; which has solved neither my heart rate issue or blood pressure (still high). My EP told me that I have inappropriate sinus tacky cardia; and that I may just have it for the remainder of my life. My current worry is that when i'm at the gym my heart rate is generally around 175; but will rise to about 200. I get short of breath; so I stop. My doctor assures me that this is okay; but if I'm on medication to control the heart rate and its still that high; I don't understand how thats normal. I also sometimes feel palpations; but I had a heart monitor test and it didn't show any major abnormalities (I couldn't wear it when at the gym). I don't know what to do at this point. I'm at such a loss and feeling so out of control with my body. If anyone has any diagnosis suggestions I would sincerely appreciate it; or just to share your story.

221,Diltiazem+hypertension,I talked with Gail a little while ago and she sounds good. She got out of the hospital last Wed. and for some unfathomable reason they still don't know what is wrong with her. She is on oxygen so she is kind of under house arrest until they figure it out. She had been waiting to get in to see this heart Dr where she lives; but he has not seemed in any big hurry so she has made an appt with either a heart specialist or heart clinic in Paducah for next Thurs. The Dr that referred her to the local heart guy told Gail that this heart guy thought of himself as semi retired and I am thinking he is semi retarded. She tried like crazy to get in touch with him and he still hasn't returned her calls. She has cancer for God's sake you don't put people off like that. I think her Dr said that the heart guy was reluctant to do surgeries because of this semi retirement and I didn't catch if that was pertaining to Gail or in general. I was on a cell phone and she is sucking oxygen so it was hard to hear and I didn't want to keep asking you to repeat yourself because you were starting to sound winded. Sorry; I won't talk about you like you are not here. Anyhow; they still think it is Pulmonary Hypertension and it can be treated with; of all things; Viagra. They think it is this PH thing because she is just fine on the oxygen (well; as fine as you can be hooked up to a tank) but 5 minutes without it and she is gasping for air. The Viagra makes sense; since it increases blood flow; but in her case it will be to the lungs. This is from the American Heart Association: The blood vessels that supply the lungs constrict and their walls thicken; so they can't carry as much blood. As in a kinked garden hose; pressure builds up and backs up. The heart works harder; trying to force the blood through. If the pressure is high enough; eventually the heart can't keep up; and less blood can circulate through the lungs to pick up oxygen. Patients then become tired; dizzy and short of breath. Here is the link if you would like to learn more. http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11076 She said she has been sleeping alot; but that is probably for the best anyway. Oh; another friend of hers on here called her Dr @ MD Anderson and told him what was going on (good for you; what a good friend) and her Dr got in touch with her local guy and they are changing her chemo; but I am sorry; I didn't hear what it was; but she won't have to go back on chemo until after her next trip to MD Anderson June 25th & 26th.

224,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 28 years old and otherwise a healthy individual. Last April I woke up one day with what I believe to have been atrial fibrillation; but by the time the EMT's arrived; I had converted. The doctor's at the hospital told me not to sweat it. I then had about two more episodes of atrial fibrillation after binge drinking the night before; but converted on my own. I did not think there was much of a problem until about a month and a half ago when I started to get PVC's every night. Then about a week after they began; I woke up with my heart wildly out of control. The EMT's came and hooked me up on a 12 lead and determined that I had a heart rate of about 280 bpm and that I was in atrial fibrillation along with Vtach and PVC's. I went to the hospital and stayed about 4 days. They thought maybe WPW; but my echo and stress test were negative for the delta wave or any other problems. I had an EP study performed; whereby my elecrophysiologist concluded atrial fibrillation. However; I think this conclusion was based on the notion that they were unable to reproduce my arrhythmia; so AFib was the default answer. I have been doing extensive research and thought my arrhythmias were related to GERD because I had noticed my PVC's were worse after acid reflux. It got to the point that every time I would lay down; I would have constant PVC's. On Thanksgiving I had bad heartburn; one alcoholic beverage; and atrial fibrillation the next morning. I had gone on a GERD friendly diet waiting to see the physician; and I magically felt a lot better. However; a few days later I started having PVC's at night again; but this time it was not when I laid down; but rather after I had slept for awhile. I had a barium swallow; which came back negative for GERD; but positive for duodenitis. Feeling lost as to my problem; I came across information about vagally mediated atrial fibrillation; which seemed to make the most sense. I believe my duodenitis to be caused by an over-secretion of stomach acid due to the vagus nerve; which is why the test was negative as to GERD. I am also male; young; otherwise healthy heart; former military and athlete. I now have PVC's; which occur after about every 5-7 hours of sleep. I can I get up for a few hours and then go back to bed (assuming my vagal tone is not so high) and I can sleep without palpitations. I feel my heart rate is not as consistent anymore as it used to be. My resting rate is about 75-85 bpm; but goes up to about 120 or 130 when I stand up and walk around. So my questions are: (1) does this sound like vagally mediated atrial fibrillation and PVC's? (2) is an ablation a viable option for vagally mediated atrial fibrillation? (3) are there any tests that can be performed to check the function of the vagus nerve? (4) Should I also see a neurologist; and if so are there any subspecialties to look for that focus on the vagus nerve? I should note that I am seeing my electrophysiologist this week; and I am scheduled to see a gastroenterologist sometime soon. I am on diltiazem; but I only take as needed to convert out of AFib. However; I have taken the dilitiazem hoping it would help with the PVC's; but it did not seem to make a difference; and maybe even made them worse.,2010,2010,27.0,Male,,,I 28 year old otherwis healthi individu last april I woke one day I believ atrial fibril time emt arriv I convert the doctor hospit told sweat I two episod atrial fibril bing drink night convert I think much problem month half ago I start get pvc everi night then week began I woke heart wildli control the emt came hook 12 lead determin I heart rate 280 bpm I atrial fibril along vtach pvc I went hospit stay 4 day they thought mayb wpw echo stress test neg delta wave problem I EP studi perform wherebi elecrophysiologist conclud atrial fibril howev I think conclus base notion unabl reproduc arrhythmia afib default answer I extens research thought arrhythmia relat gerd I notic pvc wors acid reflux It got point everi time I would lay I would constant pvc On thanksgiv I bad heartburn one alcohol beverag atrial fibril next morn I gone gerd friendli diet wait see physician I magic felt lot better howev day later I start pvc night time I laid rather I slept awhil I barium swallow came back neg gerd posit duoden feel lost problem I came across inform vagal mediat atrial fibril seem make sens I believ duoden caus oversecret stomach acid due vagu nerv test neg gerd I also male young otherwis healthi heart former militari athlet I pvc occur everi 57 hour sleep I I get hour go back bed assum vagal tone high I sleep without palpit I feel heart rate consist anymor use My rest rate 7585 bpm goe 120 130 I stand walk around So question 1 sound like vagal mediat atrial fibril pvc 2 ablat viabl option vagal mediat atrial fibril 3 test perform check function vagu nerv 4 should I also see neurologist subspecialti look focu vagu nerv I note I see electrophysiologist week I schedul see gastroenterologist sometim soon I diltiazem I take need convert afib howev I taken dilitiazem hope would help pvc seem make differ mayb even made wors
225,Diltiazem+hypertension,Two SVT related questions: 1) I've only experienced SVT one time a few weeks ago. What are the risks for not taking anything to prevent a recurrence? Wouldn't it be OK to not take anything? Isn't it likely that I won't have a recurring episode for a long time? 2) Are there any alternatives to regular blood pressure medication for treating SVT? I was taking metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily; but this caused me to experience chest pressure. My cardiologist took me off of it and put me on a low dose of cardizem. I haven't experienced any ill effects so far from cardizem; but I would much rather find a natural treatment for SVT like acupuncture or natural medicines.

226,Diltiazem+hypertension,I was diagnosed with mild left ventricular hypertrophy due probably to hypertension and told to treat the hypertension and not to worry. I had this condition for at least two years before I knew about it. It was called to my attention by an echo report in my records while attending a new physician. I have had some very rare pvcs and pacs showing up since my twenties. Suddenly lots of pacs showed up on a monitor in 2002 along with a regular two a minute about that time. There were thousands of pacs. This alarmed me ; but I was told they were benign. They seemed to go away for several years. Then in 2006- 2007 I began to have night attacks of high blood pressure and rapid pulse up to 120-150bpm at times; These were about every 3 -5 months; sometimes more and would sometimes send me to the E.R.. These attacks are very scary when waking up out of sleep usually 1:30 or 3:00 A.M. No one could decide why. Theory was anxiety attacks; or med not holding twenty four hours. I take hyzaar 50/12.5 and taztia for diltiazem 120 extended release q day. Then in February of this year I awoke in a -fibrillation went to the E.R. by ambulance and was kept at the hospital overnight. I converted into a regular rhythm with use of lanoxin and digoxin and heparin by 4:00 the next afternoon. I had just seen a cardiologist the Monday before for these recurrent night episodes and was told that I did not even need a cardiologist until this suprised even him. I saw him again the Monday after the a-fib. He said that he would just watch me and not even change any meds right now. I'm 59 and was in really good health before . This lvh disgnosis and the a-fib attack have really scared me. Can you please tell me anything about this to help my confidence or to just help me to be more informed? What more can I do?

227,Diltiazem+hypertension,"In october of last year; I went to the hospital with chest pains. My bp was 195/110. they gave me three nitro glycerin tablets before it came down. The blood test revealed no negative enzymes. That was a sat. night and I was admitted to the hospital and put on a nitro patch. 5 AM monday morning; the ekg showed that I had ""flipped my t-waves."" Up to that point the ekg hadn't changed. Tues. morning I was transferred to another hospital for a heart cath. That revealed no damage but the doctor said that part of my heart was not beating with the rest. I believe it was the anterior apical. The diagnosis based on the above info was that I had a coronary artery spasm. that there was some damage to my heart but they felt it was reverseable. I was told I have prinzmetal's angina also. I went to cardiac rehab for 3 months and was working out 4 days a weeks at the gym after I finished the rehab. A few weeks ago; I went to SLC; Utah. On both planes on the way out I had chest pains and took my nitro. The next day I had chest pains 2 more times. The hotel called the paramedics and I was taken to the er. My bp was again 190/110. I had chest pains again in the hospital and they gave me nitro and it finally came down and stayed down. After 6 hours they released me. The cardio- logist at the er in Utah said he thought I got cehst pains because of the high bp and that he wasn't convinced it was angina or that I had a CAS in October. I was dizzy off and on for the week that I was there but I thought this was due to the altitude (I live at sea level and SLC is 4500 ft.) When I returned home I was still dizzy. Went to my cardiologist and my bp was 200/100. He put me on diovan and sent me for a renal scan with flow (nuclear). the results of the renal scan were R>L 55>45. that was a couple of weeks ago. the diovan is keeping my bp around 110/70. the cario. wanted me to go to our local community hospital and have a renal angiogram and possible angioplasty. This hasn't been done at this hospital before and I don't think I want to be the first. My primary physician is sending me to another cardiologist at Temple University in Phila. for a second opinion. I see him on the 22nd of this month. This is where I get confused. Why a second cardiologist? Should I be seeing a different kind of specialist? Sorry I forgot to mention that I am 48 year old female. My father had a heart attack at 54 and he had high blood pressure although he was an acute alcoholic so I assumed the bp was from the alcohol. I don't drink (haven't in 19 years); stopped smoking 3 years ago. Smoked from 18 to 26; didn't smoke from 26 to 36; smoked from 36 to 45. I take cardizem cd 300mg; lipitor 10mg; premarin 1.25 and one aspirin daily. And now diovan 80 mg. From what I have read 55>45 doesn't sound definitive for blockage but I was told that normally the left kidney has greater flow then the right. I am wondering IF my renal artery is partially blocked; could this have been the reason for the cardiac event in October? Could it have been that my bp going so high caused damage to my heart? It was more then 2 hours before I went to the hospital and my bp was high at the hospital for a while before they finally got it down.

228,Diltiazem+hypertension,Ever since I was diagnosed with what was thought to be a MI; I have been seeking the answer to what happened. I have had a DR. here on Cleveland Clinic say from the sTress tEst I was given and the symptoms that it sounded like I did indeed have a MI; allthough a mild one probably. Also the Stress tests indicated that I may have had one and some area of damage; or what is called Stunned Myocardium. The first cardioloigst I went to did a Catherization which showed no blockages and then a Echocardiogram. I saw him today and haven't got the actuall report yet; but he told me from the symptoms I have that he now thinks what I have is Vaso spasms of the heart; or atypical angina. He talked about calcium channel blockers and using the nitro I am already taking. He based this on the symptoms and the fact that taking the nitro helped with chest symptoms after taking Nitro. The question started when I asked about Ischemia and parts of the heart not getting enough blood; / oxygen; and if you don't have blocked arteries; if you could still have symptoms if you are not getting enough blood. He said yes; then I asked about if there was any connection between Raynaulds disease and Ischemic Disease of the heart. I dont think he gave me a direct answer; but this question gave him some intersest; and when he found out I have suffered from Raynaulds since the 1980's; he seemed to be putting two and two together. The other thing I thought was interesting; was than this initial attack was very strong; and that I had several clusters of them close together from begginning of April till the end of May. I have not had a Angina attack for about 3 weeks. My attacks came with no exertion or exercise; no foods or undue stress. The fact is that I have been MORE STRESSED SINCE THE INITIAL ATTACK; BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND THE CAUSE OR DEFINITE DIAGNOSIS. So it was not anxiety; panic disorder; GERD; or anything similiar. I have severeal EKGS that mention possible Mycardial Ischmic disease. How is that diagnosed or can it be diagnosed? Has anyone else had a connection between Raynaulds Disease and this Coronary Vasospasms of the heart? I have read different things on the Web about Pretmetals Angina; is this the same thing? How often do these attacks come and go or how do you know when you will get an attack? One thing I read talked about doing the same thing you do for Heart disease; such as lowering the prevention like high blood pressure and high cholesteral; and smoking. I take meds for high blood pressure and cholesteral; and I quit smoking 30 years ago. What other things can I do to keep this under controll? I am still wondering why the dr on Cleveland Clinic had the ( apparently ) wrong diagnosis from the stress test? Thanks to everyone who helped me in trying to figure out what is going on.NOw I just need to see my Regular Dr. to see what is done next.

229,Diltiazem+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

230,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I have a nonfunctional pituitary microadenoma and was wondering when surgery is indicated. I have been to MGH for a brief appointment and they suggested that they do surgery when the tumor grows over 1 cm. This is due to the fact that in their experience; the tumors continue to grow once over 1 cm. At the time of my appointment last year; my adenoma measured 8mm x 5mm x 7mm. They thought it would probably never grow. However; a recent MRI showed that it has slight enlargement at 8mm x 9mm x 7mm. I have adrenal insufficiency secondary to ACTH insufficiency but no other hormones are deficient yet. The tumor is located along the right cavernous sinus but doesn't invade the cavernous sinus yet. I have a few questions about this. 1. When does the Cleveland Clinic operate on nonfunction pituitary microadenomas? 2. Do you ever see ACTH as being the only affected stimulating hormone or the first deficient stimulating hormone? Also; I have some T2 hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the brain consistent with microvascular changes. I'm only 39 and have some kind of autoimmune process with anticardiolipin antibodies. Could this be the cause? Should I be evaluated for something else? The pattern of the T2 hyperintensities is not consistent with MS. Could it be caused by Lyme? Will they progress?

231,Diltiazem+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky.

233,Diltiazem+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night.

234,Diltiazem+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think?

236,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 25 year old caucasian male of irish descent. Ever since being physically active as a child; I have had problems with muscle cramping. Strenuous and semi stressful physical exertion would often be accompanied by extreme painful muscle cramping in major leg and arm muscles. Making it difficult to move; let alone lift a particular arm or leg. Growing up I had a normal childhood riding bikes; playing baseball; tag; all the sorts of things young kids do. Often times the cramping would never present itself. Appears to almost be random. In highschool I ran cross country (not very well; however; often finished last in races due to extreme muscle cramping/pain; but I always finished a race; running through the pain. Went on to do some track and also some tennis; along with some bowling. Have experienced this extreme cramping/pain in all of these sports at one time or another. In college I did competitive fencing for two years. For the first year or so; it seemd that I was no longer presenting the symptoms described. However; a year into it I had a very stressful match and ended cramping across my entire body; not being able to move. Again; had to fight through the pain. Along with the painful cramping; another symptom has consistently presented itself. My muscles; in random places on the body; sometimes twitch or spasm. The spasms rarely last for more than 1 or 2 seconds; and seem to be random occurences. They sometimes will happen in the same area randomly for up to 10-15 minutes. It is very; very inconsistent. I also randomly somtimes experience medium to severe chest pain at random moments in time; often not accompanied with any cramping; muscle spasms; or physical activity. It can happen anywhere. Sitting down at the computer. Driving. Doing physical activity. Not doing physical activity. I had tests done at the Cleveland Clinic and they were not able to diagnose the issue. I had raised CPK and CK levels in unnaceptable leves in the thousands. However; no other enzyme or blood levels were out of whack. I had three muscle biopsies. One in my right upper thigh muscle; and one on each forearm. Tests were negative for any kinds of myopathies. Tests were negative for any severe neurological diseases like MS; MLS or any other sort of degenerative muscle disorders. Acid reflux has been toted as a likely candidate for the chest pains. Prevacid and Prilosec have both reduced chest pains slightly. However; the medium to severe chest pains have presented themselves at times when acid reflux could not possibly have been the culprit. I recently had a colonoscopy performed due to my family having a history of colon cancer. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. There was a worry that I might have inherited Crohns from my mothers side of the family; but that was not the case. I also did not appear to have IBS or anything of the sort. The only other thing I can tell you is that I have been told I have a condition called malignant hypothermia. A disorder that all anesthesialogists must be aware of prior to giving me any form of anesthesia. The Cleveland Clinic did a number of tests on me; including blood draws; muscle biopsies; ekg; though; I don't quite remember of an MRI or CT was performed. This was done when I was 19 years old. I have not had any further look into this since then; and I'm wondering what my next steps should be. Besides the unexplained muscle cramps/spasms and chest pains; I am a very healthy 25 year old male. I'm perhaps 10-15 pounds overweight; but then again who isnt. I have seasonal allergies to ragweed; pollen; mold; dust; all those. I have however never gotten an allergy ***** test. However; I'm not allergic to any of the major things like penicillin; peanuts or latex. I typically get a strep throat infection almost perhaps like clockwork every spring and fall. I don't have any sexually transmitted infections; I have never done any intravenous drugs. I've occasionally smoked marijuana and i have ingested psylocibin mushrooms one time in my entire life. I have also never broken a bone in my entire body. Mentally I have had issues with both depression and anxiety; often brought on; especially as a child; by these bizarre cramping events. Imagine having a ton of fun with other kids; only to be made fun of because I couldn't play anymore due to extreme muscle pain/soreness; being told by gym teachers and sports coaches to suck it up and quit complaining; or being called lazy because I simply could not continue with a certain physical activity due to extreme cramping and muscle pain. Also; I was told by one of the doctors that I should avoid massive amounts of caffiene. Is there any truth to this?

239,Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been constipated the last couple of weeks. I took some Senokot last Tuesday to help with this. Then on Wednesday I had a bowel movement. It was really hard to pass the stools. I noticed there was blood on my stools and on the toilet paper. I went to a doctor the same day and was told it was an anal fissure. The doctor gave me hydrocortisone suppositories. I took these for a couple of days; but had to stop using them because it was too painful to use them. Also; that same day I drank some prune juice. This caused me to have diarrhea; which worsened the pain. Ever since Wednesday I have been in so much pain I have not been able to sit up; therefore have not been able to work. I have to lay on my side; I cannot even ride in a car. The pain is constant; not just when having a bowel movement. I have increased my fiber intake and fluid intake and now I'm having 1-2 soft bowel movements per day. I have been taking 3-4 tub baths in plain warm water a day. I have tried using hydrocortisone cream and anesthetic cream. None of this seems to be helping. I also noticed something strange when I was applying the cream. It looks like there is something hanging from my anus. I can't tell if it is skin or a hemorrhoid; but the doctor did not mention it. I also feel constant pressure there; like something is pushing down on me. I haven't noticed anymore blood in my stool. And yesterday I started to have itching and burning (like I'm on fire) there also. I'm not sure what to do. How long do fissures take to heal? How long do they take to stop causing so much pain? I can't miss anymore work from this; but I can't even sit up. I'm typing this standing. Could I have something else going on with me besides a fissure?

240,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Here's something that might buy some valuable time and help in a blood pressure spike. I had them for years and then not. Recently the last two or three days - I had bp go to 169/85 and I'm currently trying to figure out what caused that. I got up and had two cokes and 2 cups of coffee and we had breakfast (bought at cracker barrel restaurant) Most of the day both times it was in the 111/64 to 135/70 range - then suddenly shot up late in the day and reached over 150/75. I took extra medicationa and it didn't come down. So I'm going to tell you of a method to bring down a spike - unless caused by some secondary reason such as organ failure. its' not pleasant but it sure beats a stroke or heart attack. This is the use of prune juice to clean your sytem. I drink 32 ounces as fast as I can and I stay near the bathroom (obviously ) After passing a lot of fluid out - the pressure in the arteries goes down as fluids equalize thoughout the body. I used to be on the Bloodpressureline - where endocrinologist and hard to control hypertension specialist Dr. Clarence Grim was and when told of the prune juice method he said ""maybe we should have some clinical trials of that) He may have been joking but it works. If you drink the prune juice within an hour you will be dropping fluids in 1.5 hours and for me and most people the blood pressure will drop fast. I would stay near the bathroom. I don't personally like prune juice but we keep it on hand all the time and I used it today and yesterday and it got my bp down into thw 120/65 range and it will go lower tonight. After this all my meds work better as my bp stays down as long as I don't eat salt or what I'm suspicious of - Coffee - I take cardizem (diltiazem) and lasix. One guy on the blood pressure forum tried it and said ""I got a very nice reduction in blood pressure - but then I went and replenished the fluid that was lost and the bp came back up."" He didn't understand that most people - especially those overweight carry way too much fluid in their bodies and you take some out and you dont restore it. So if you are thinking you might be going to have a stroke or heart attack because of high blood pressure - give it a try and you should see a reduction in bp within a couple of hours. We have had times when me taking more medication did not bring the blood pressure down and the Prune Juice was the only thing that worked. My wife also has high blood pressure and was going to use ""pruny"" we call it but she hates it too. She was able to cut back on her fluid intake and her bp went down. We think it is salt and in fact when we keep the salt intake down bp stays down too - that and I love my coffee and sometimes drink too much.

243,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 44 year old registered nurse; who for the last 8 months have had right upper quadrant pain; sometimes radiating round to the back and bouts of heavy nausea. Previously in May I was diagnosed with tiny scattered ulcers from the stomach through to the small intestine; this was thought to be related to the anti-imflammatory's I had been taking for acute back pain previously experience in mid Feb to mid March. This problem is cuurently resolved. However; the ruqp and nausea has continued and after a trip to A&E who ruled out a perforated ulcer after bloods and x-rays were taken; and an admittance due to dehydration and pain mx my specialist just monitored my symptoms and treated with Motilium and analgesia. I continued to experience actue episodes of ruqp and nausea and called my gastroenterologist to help me. He arrange for me to be admitted for tests and after an Endoscopic U/S sludge was discovered in the Gall Bladder; and it was decided to remove the GB immediately. The surgeon was certain the sludge in the GB was due to 20 KGs I had loss from dieting from Feb 09 to June 09. After post -op pain had subsided I still had bouts of nausea and occasional ruqp. I visited the specialist before I took a 5 week holiday in the UK. It was decided I would continue to take the Motilium and analgesia as required. My first night I was gripped with horrendous abdominal pain totally different to before more mid-upper and under rib pain which took my breath away to descibe would say these were more like a spasm pains. I had 3 waves of these pains which all lasted about 2 minutes each and left me feeling very nauseous. Over the next 4 5 weeks the nausea came in waves and pain was intermittant. Then in Mid-October these spasm pains returned with a vengence. The next day my specialist mentioned a dysfunction called 'Sphincter of Oddi'; bloods taken were negative and he just gave me alternative options to control these spasms and nausea. Tiny mini-like-spasms felt leading up to xmas were manageable; then xmas morning the spasm came out of the blue; unbale to take the Buscopan until pain subsided I was unable to eat/drink anything all day; eating around 18.00 that evening; the same pattern the next day with some back shoulder blade pain that kept me awake all night; with one addition the sharp stabbing pain right-sided and under the ribs (just like GB pain). this became unabearable and so visited the casualty Dept; unable to be canulated due to being dehydrated; bloods were finally taken but were nagative; my pain score as the spasm and sharp pains came and went were very hight 8-9/10. I was later transferred to my pivate hospital and looked after by the specialist; where I was treated with IM Buscopan and Morphine Tabs and IM over the next 8 days. My specialist is certain I have SODD but his partner is reluctant to perform the ERCP as the risk of Pancreatitis is high; but I have been started on Diltiazem mg QID and Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg one am and two nocte. what evidence is there to suggest these two drugs will help my symptoms and after how long will I noticce they are haviing an effect; and how long will I need to take them???,2010,2010,45.0,Female,,,I 44 year old regist nurs last 8 month right upper quadrant pain sometim radiat round back bout heavi nausea previous may I diagnos tini scatter ulcer stomach small intestin thought relat antiimflammatori I take acut back pain previous experi mid feb mid march thi problem cuurent resolv howev ruqp nausea continu trip AE rule perfor ulcer blood xray taken admitt due dehydr pain mx specialist monitor symptom treat motilium analgesia I continu experi actu episod ruqp nausea call gastroenterologist help He arrang admit test endoscop US sludg discov gall bladder decid remov GB immedi the surgeon certain sludg GB due 20 kg I loss diet feb 09 june 09 after post op pain subsid I still bout nausea occasion ruqp I visit specialist I took 5 week holiday UK It decid I would continu take motilium analgesia requir My first night I grip horrend abdomin pain total differ midupp rib pain took breath away descib would say like spasm pain I 3 wave pain last 2 minut left feel nauseou over next 4 5 week nausea came wave pain intermitt then midoctob spasm pain return vengenc the next day specialist mention dysfunct call sphincter oddi blood taken neg gave altern option control spasm nausea tini minilikespasm felt lead xma manag xma morn spasm came blue unbal take buscopan pain subsid I unabl eatdrink anyth day eat around 1800 even pattern next day back shoulder blade pain kept awak night one addit sharp stab pain rightsid rib like GB pain becam unabear visit casualti dept unabl canul due dehydr blood final taken nag pain score spasm sharp pain came went hight 8910 I later transfer pivat hospit look specialist I treat IM buscopan morphin tab IM next 8 day My specialist certain I sodd partner reluct perform ercp risk pancreat high I start diltiazem mg qid ursodeoxychol acid 250mg one two noct evid suggest two drug help symptom long I noticc havi effect long I need take
244,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47.0,Male,,,I 47 year old male athlet unfortun 4 month ago I heart attackmi left ventricl arteri 100 occlud 2 regular metal stent place left arteri It big shock everybodi especi sinc cholesterol 170 time even heart attack blood pressur 12480 plu genet nobodi die heart attack among rel I eat fri fast food diet gener ok My pain never stop I experienc constant chest pressur short breath doctor pay attent He say etiolog pain known shouldnt anyth cardiac sinc stress test oklast month I end emerg room restenosi one stent clog 99 anoth stent place top two thi time xienc 5 drug elut stent went top two the doctor start pay littl attent even apolog listen mesinc thenit month I continu experi problem everi day I pain doesnt matter I exercis sit offic the pain may start middl chest move right left goe backupp part shoulder right breast bone hurt sometim tender touch befor I heart attack I never experienc anyth like everyth start stent place ani suggest comment greatli appreci I function normal I hope stem cell scienc advanc much faster anticip bring new avenu hope peopl like us
245,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Prograf is a medicine that slows down the bodys immune system. For this reason; it works as an anti-rejection medicine. Prograf helps patients who have had a liver/kidney transplant protect their new organ and prevent it from being rejected by the body. This medicine can cause the amount of potassium in your blood-stream to increase. For this reason you should avoid large amounts of foods that have a high potassium content; for example dried fruit; bananas; tomatoes and low sodium salt; while you are taking this medicine; also avoid potassium supplements. I had a bad reaction from eating these foods. I had been warned about grapefruit juice; as it increases the amount of Prograf in the blood-stream. I did not know about the problems with other foods. Being a health food addict; this is what I eat. I had noticed I had not felt good for a couple of days but did not think that much about it. After about 3 days I knew something wasn't right with my body. I went to the emergency room at my local hospital and after many blood tests I found out that I had too much potassium in my body. I was fortunate the level was not that high. It was an easy cure and I'am fine; (no damage to me or my new liver); but I wanted to warn everyone about this. My doctor told me there are many foods that are being tested to see what there reaction is when Prograf is used by a transplant recipient. The new foods being tested are all citrus fruits. Pomegranate and apricots are now being studied to see if they have the same effect as grapefruit juice; (increasing Prograf levels). My doctors advise to me is; ""If you eat something and later don't feel well; don't eat it again.""

246,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having ""unexplained"" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always ""pounding;"" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1"" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

248,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hi all; Have never been able to post before...so even though I am doing better I thought I would leave a post with some of my questions. First; thanks to the doctors and CC for creating this site. 1. I had a lone A-Fib back in July...none since. Had some PVCs in late July and early August...but hardly any since. I guess I am wondering the million dollar question...how can I keep my A-Fib episode from coming back? 2. I have heard of people having A-Fib once and it not coming back...what are the percentages on this? 3. What are the overall numbers of no A-Fib recurrence for someone cardioverted? That was what was weird about mine...I stayed in it at the hospital for about 10 hours and the meds were not converting me...is this cause for concern? 4. I have been exercising (2 miles 4xs a week); and doing yard work type stuff. I am still afraid to lift heavy objects; and play basketball or football...would any of these things increase the risk. 5. It seems like A-Fib doesn't have to effect life exp. or quality of life...thoughts? 6. I went to see a regional research center EP in mid August. He looked over my myriad tests from both March and July. He said he saw a totally healthy heart and ""zero"" reason to even do an EP study...I assume there is no reason for another opinion? 7. Docs who cardioverted me put me on 120mg of Cartia and after Coumadin for 3 weeks I am now on aspirin...does this sound about right? 8. My AF just appeared out of nowhere when I rolled over in bed one night...any reason for concern?

249,Diltiazem+hypertension,": Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on ""spectral"" and ""verapimil"". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible. I feel mine very strongly and they leave me somewhat short of breath after continuing for longer than about 1 minute (30-40 PVCs in one minute). I have tried most of the ""...lol"" meds (sotalol; pindolol; spectral; atenolol; acebutolol; enderal)and a few combinations of the above without any real relief.

Wichert 801 Date Drive Pearl City; HI 96782 or e-mail me at ***@****. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply. Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as ""non-sustained"". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one.

251,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52.0,Female,,,ill tri write novel get point Im healthi woman 52 yr I health issu healthi heart chad score 0 BP nice low 10060 dont smoke drink anymor big trigger etc etc after ablat pvc I develop afib I wonder high profil cardiologist boston perform ablat He put flecainid work 75mgday 50mgday metoprolol It work first blip but I start frighten episod svt brought ER eventu hospit He took flecainid seem caus svt I also atrial flutter I cardiovers still afib heart rate high Im event monitor report doctor heart rate 150 last night I slept He put 100mg metoprolol ill take 2nd dose 50mg minut He want brand name toprol XL pharmaci hard time stock right Im regular extend releas version take pm OK done background here issu ive onlin read page page page peopl taken side effect dosag report scare tear everyth hair thin huge weight gain Im somewhat overweight last thing I need sleepless extrem exhaust depress sweat zero libido worsen afib goe honestli Im upset frighten I knew I shouldnt gone onlin read stuff I Im shock preval advers side effect I feel like Im go becom chronic unhealthi person begin end healthi year Oh one thing I read imposs lose weight metoprolol slow heart unabl burn fat even ton work thi stink soon monitor come I plan start work lose excess weight I went ER heart rate 200 BP still perfect I told kind phenomen heart muscl obvious strong Id like keep way ani thought
252,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 46 yr old fem. fit & in good health; B/P 110/70. In June '02; I got sick with an illness which had the major symptom of orthostatic hypotension & other organ symptoms. After 1 wk I could only crawl on my hands/knees due to fainting/weakness.I was sent to Stanford Med Ctr for 10 days.Had an echocardiogram; blood tests; tilt table testing; etc.I was on IV only for 10 days.Their diag: Orthostatic hypotension & gave proamitine. Proamitine made me sick & altered.They sent me home 2 days later & my GP took me off Proamitine as he thought I had a bad virus.After 9 wks I started to get better;no more cardiac symptoms;just getting my strength & life back.Then in March 03; I had tightness in my chest; squeezing in left arm.I went to the ER. B/P was 160/100 and pulse was 180.EKG showed no abnormalities.I was given an Ativan and refered to a cardiologist.I did a Holter monitor and a stress echo.Holter showed several instances of 148 BPM while showering; or just sitting and several PAC/PVC's some coming every other beat.Stress echo showed several PAC's & PVC's that lessened with exercise. After reviewing the Stress Echo/Holter;was told I have benign PVC's & PAC's and just deal with them or take beta blockers.I asked why all of a sudden I started having PAC's PVC's they said they didn't know.I asked if they would go away-they said no.Can someone tell me why these all of a sudden cropped up; and what can be done for them? I have multiple per minute and am uncomfortable. Are these as benign as they say? Organs just don't start acting up for no reason do they? What can I do?

They seem real positive about grapefruit. They also list a few drugs which can't be taken with grapefruit. Just came back from my doctor and he said I could have it. He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit!

255,Diltiazem+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this?,2008,2008,,,,,for past sever year I notic eat food rang cup milk full meal heart rate blood pressur increas significantli 30 minut eat last one 12 hour two hour thi occur 50 time eat My heart rate goe 75 bpm 140 bmp max todat blood pressur goe 13080 180102 max date note I borderlin hypertens take 20mg lisinopril day I attempt determin particular type food food addit might trigger symptom notic symptom alway occur I eat peanut butter snack cracker sold vend machin occassion happen I eat homemad macroni chees other food I find relationship I cup milk one morn get symptom cup next day gallon symptom I sever test hospit stress test sonogram heart gastronom test result Of cours test conduct eat I exhibit symptom Do thought might caus
256,Diltiazem+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me. Could you recommend anything. I am hanging by a thread.

257,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I have been suffering from episodes of pain and discomfort in the epi-gastric area. It feels like I am going to have a heart attack; it is a pressure/discomfort in upper abdomen and back between shoulder blades with palpitations and difficulty getting a deep breath. It seems to come on as an ""attack"". I find that it happens most during my walks for exercise; when bending over; before or after meals; and also before bowel movements. I have had several tests run: abdominal ultrasound normal; several EKG's normal; Echocardiogram showing MItral Valve Prolapse; Endoscopy showing gastritis; eosinophilic esophagitis; incompetent LES.

258,Diltiazem+hypertension,I have a scheduled ablation this Friday. I was diagnosed with SVT and I didn't even know I had it. I get a lot of palpitations and I am currently on 25mg of beta blocker x2 a day. I want to know if the ablation is worth it. Will it get rid of my palpitations? The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23). I think I had an SVT once and that was a year ago playing basketball; I came down from a shot and landed hard and my heart started beating fast and weird and I couldn't control it. The symptom went away in about 10 seconds.

259,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!,2009,2009,34.0,Female,,,hello everyon I 34 year old femal diagnos 8 month ago hypothyroid addit test diagnos hashimoto thyroid My initi tsh level 127 I I place 50 mcg levothyroxin My tsh level 48 I normal hypothyroid symptom weight gain muscl pain tired etc biggest complaint doesnt fit symptom hypo heart palpit At worst I sometim 5 6 hour day I see cardiologist ekg echocardiogram also wear 24hour heart monitor after review test cardiologist said I perfectli healthi heart palpit like result hypothyroid for first month levothyroxin I honestli say I not feel better howev past 6 8 week I begun feel like old self final palpit start subsid occur 3 4 hour day 1 hour day flutter I absolut elat gone within past week howev soon I woke morn I could tell I didnt feel right ive palpit episod last night last 2 hour it day sinc palpit return I scare death I go start deal they make feel aw I promis I go keep concis possibl look I appear fail ha anyon els diagnos hashimoto hypothyroid suffer long episod heart palpit ani help advic would greatli appreci
260,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

261,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this ""discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out."" I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel ""normal"" again.

262,Diltiazem+hypertension,Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago.

264,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I believe I suffer from white coat hypertension. Earlier (until a year ago); when I didn't care about my blood pressure; I always had excellent results when my doctor measured it (115-120/60-70). After I started worrying about my heart (not so much anymore; I usually try my best to help people on the heart rhythm community) my BP readings are higher. I feel my muscles get tense and my heart starts pounding when the cuff inflates; and blood pressure is 140-155/80-95. At home; I get similar symptoms on the first measuring; but it resolves and gradually slows to 120/70 after some tries. I measured it one weekend after a good night of sleep and it was 105/55. I was completely relaxed; for once; at that time. What is quite strange; is that I imagine this started when I started using propranolol (20 mg) for PACs and sinus tachycardia. After this; my heart didn't race when I got scared; but beat harder instead. When I was really scared; I actually had bradycardia; but I got a strange sensation that my blood vessels were constricted (may be imagination..) I got my beta blocker changed to metoprolol (25 mg) and I feel my anxiety getting a bit stronger. But now my heart races a bit more in response to anxiety. Can propranolol actually contribute to higher blood pressure with stress? Are my assumptions correct that propranolol works better on anxiety due to the non-selective effect? Is my BP really normal? My heart is otherwise fine with normal chambers; wall dimensions and excellent contractility (EF 78%). I have some PACs but I'm otherwise healthy; exercise 3 times/week and normal weight.

265,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello everyone. I am new to this group. I am a 44 year old female. Never had high BP before. It was always around 120/80 except during pregnancy. For whatever the reason it would elevate then. About a year ago during a routine GYN exam; my doctor told me that when I came in and the nurse took my BP that it was very high. 175/115. He asked me if I had previously had any BP problems before and I said not that I know of. So he was nervous for me and wanted me to go to the hospital. But I was able to immediately get an appointment with my primary doctor and went right in to see him. He put me on a BP med which didn't agree with me and so I eventually stopped taking it. When I went back to see him to get a new medication to try; my BP wasn't bad so he said let's just monitor it to see if it goes back up. It didn't. But then it started to be 140/90 and it would sometimes go to 150/90 and now it is 160/100. So it went back up again. I went to see him the other day because for the past week I have not been feeling well and new something was off. I have been having a pain in my neck and hearing a heartbeat in my ear and having a lot of headaches. So he said that he is going to start me on a water pill to see if that helps to lower it. Now previously; in the past I had once been put on Furosemide. I had a bad reaction to it. I had some of the side effects listed under dangerous side effects and had to stop taking it. So I reminded my doctor of that and he put me on Hydrochlorothiazide. I took this for one day and was extremely sick the whole day. I started with some dizziness; and headache; then went to cramps which turned into very bad cramps. I wasn't too concerned at first because I read that as your body adjusts to it you can get a bit dizzy; and headache; and stomach upset. But when the cramps started getting so bad; I got worried. I began having diarrhea This continued on and off throughout the day. I called the pharmacist and asked if this was normal and he said no. That it was not normal and to not take it the next day and to tell my doctor. So I have to tell my doctor today and ask if there is something else I can take. I would like to know from anyone here if there is a water pill that you know of that is gentle on a sensitive stomach. Any advice would help.

269,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,70.0,Male,,,I male 70 year age I 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 thi control BP within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 My doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 My concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level Do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead I tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret

273,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,At my recent physical; my doctor took my blood pressure while I was crying and deemed it high and prescribed me medication for it.

I've been monitoring it since that time (I haven't started the pills yet) and my blood pressure still remains around 115/75 to 125/85 with the a slight increase immediately after exertion (up to 143/85).

I have hypertension and vascular insufficiency along with fluctuating aldosterone and renin levels. My blood pressure is currently under control with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 90mg of adalat cc. However; the blood pooling in my legs causes me great discomfort even when standing for short periods of time; I have researched POTS and that seems to fit except for the fact that I have high blood pressure. Has anyone else had similar symptoms as a young woman and found a diagnosis at some point? I have made my rounds to numerous nephrologists; hypertension specialists; pulmonologists; endocrinologists; and cardiologists to no avail other than the suggestion I have hyperaldosteronism that was later ruled out. Renal artery stenosis is also something I have been tested for but some physicians have still suspected it. I am being referred to a cardiologist again due to the increasing issue I have having with circulation.

If so how would I handle that? I've also had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia -though a lot of the symptoms have eased (if not abated yet);since starting thyroid med. The only BP that I take is HCTZ diuretic(hydrochlorothiazide) 25mgs in the morning. Would you consider that aggressive enough treatment? I was prescribed Inderal initially; along with the diuretic. But it caused a problem with worsening hypothyroid symptoms;(blocks conversion of T4-T3)- so I was put on the Ace Inhibitor Altace (with HCTZ). After 2 weeks I was tested and showed a marked problem with creatinine levels. I wonder -if I'm only able to tolerate a diuretic (as it would appear) - whether a change to a stronger one like Lasix (Furosemide) might do some good in dropping the extreme BP spikes? Its good to know hypothyroid doesn't cause the BP problem. I'm wondering if levels of thyroid MEDICATION might - even though levels are presently optimized? BP readings done on multiple days.

279,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello doctor; I am a 24 year old male who takes Losartan 100; Toprol xl25 and Hydrochlorothiazide 25. Recently a psychiatrist prescribed me Lexapro 10mg and Xanax 0.5 twice daily to hopefully treat the anxiety/panic disorder that has made my life very difficult the last few years. However I am concerned as I suffer from high blood pressure and racing heartbeat and now I am afraid to take the Lexapro as I fear its going to worsen my not so good blood pressure and heart rate. Is this a valid cause for concern? I DONT want higher blood pressure and heart rate. Should I continue taking the Xanax as prescribed if I dont wish to take the lexa? Also is it possible to just medicate myself on Xanax and skip the antidepressants altogether!? Im not depressed; just anxious and riddled with daily panic attacks.,2012,2012,23.0,Male,,,hello doctor I 24 year old male take losartan 100 toprol xl25 hydrochlorothiazid 25 recent psychiatrist prescrib lexapro 10mg xanax 05 twice daili hope treat anxietypan disord made life difficult last year howev I concern I suffer high blood pressur race heartbeat I afraid take lexapro I fear go worsen good blood pressur heart rate Is valid caus concern I dont want higher blood pressur heart rate should I continu take xanax prescrib I dont wish take lexa also possibl medic xanax skip antidepress altogeth Im depress anxiou riddl daili panic attack

283,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi All; I have been suffering form Hypertension for Past 3 months .I feel giddiness . I went to cardiologist and When I was diagnosed ; I had BP around 160/110 and Pulse rate 93 BPM. I took ECG and reading was normal. I gave all the blood test which Includes Kidney profile; Glucose & LDL & HDL. Everything is normal. My doctor prescribed me telmisartan 40 Mg . I took that for one month and later revisited same doctor. Pressure was around 150/100 again. So doctor prescribed me telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide - 40mg tablets. Last month I felt severe giddiness and visited another doctor. She measured BP and it was around 140/90 and she told me that because of elmisartan hydrochlorothiazide tablets ; I'm getting giddiness. She changed the tablet to Losartan 50 mg . Still I face minor giddiness and pressure was not reduced. My questions are 1) Why I got Hypertension at this age even though all my blood results are normal. Is it stress related 2) Should I Take medicines for Life Long? 3) Eventhough after taking medicines also ; my BP never come to 120/80 ? What is the reason?

After procedure BP was normal without mediaction for appx. one month; however hypertension returned and has not been alleviated. Follow-up CT scans and nuclear studies reveal no restenosis. I was placed on Norvasc; Altace and hydrochlorothiazide to control BP at 145/95 (average). Test for vasoactive amines was negative. Since starting medicines partial relief has been given to the flushing and severe face pain which occurred 1 month post stint procedure. Is flushing associated with BP?

285,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi - I am new to this forum. Starting a few mos ago; I had sudden onset malignant hypertension (250/150!) - always had low BP before this. Coincidently; also developed a 7cm ovarian cyst on left ovary. I have had US (both kinds); CT; and MRI and some descriptions were simple cyst; hemmoragic cyst; complex cyst; endometrioma (depending on who was reading it). Every Dr I've spoken to has acted like it was a something we could wait and watch while they searched for a cause of my sudden-onset hypertension. However; I also stopped having periods since Sept (the hypertension started in mid-summer) and my FSH and LH are very high; so the Drs say I am in menopause. I just turned 44; which I realize isn't young; but sudden menopause? and why is it a functional cyst if I'm in menopause? Also; my estrogen and testosterone are in the range of someone in normal reproductive years. I keep thinking all these things are related; but the Drs act like they are all unrelated coincidences (one guy actually said I simply had incredibly bad luck - rofl). Has anyone else developed hypertension w/ an ovarian cyst or ovarian cancer? My CA125 was 15 and I have a history of endometriosis on the same ovary (endometrioma removed 12 yrs ago). I also have the creepy bloating that many people on here have mentioned and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Has anyone else else had this sort of combination of things happen suddenly? Especially the hypertension? Thanks in advance for any insights any of you may have.

286,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"6 monthes ago I started getting shortness of breath in the shower in the morning. It has gotten progressively worse. Mostly with exertion. I also get light headed and have dizzy spells. 3 monthes ago; I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. During routine work-up; an echo was done. My pulmonary pressure was 44. They repeated it a month later and it was 43. I was seen by a specialist who felt he needed to do a right heart catheterization. It was normal. An ECG and stress test have been normal. All bloodwork is normal. For the last couple of monthes; I have intermittent pressure down the centre of my chest. It can sometimes last all day for a short time. No shortness of breath associated with it. I am not panicky when it happens. It doesn't feel cardiac to me. In fact; I usually feel fine other than that. Eventually; I feel a ""forced cough"". Its like a balloon that is deflating and it is sputtering. Its like something is pushing air out. Its weird. The pressure is occurring more and more frequently. The cardiologist that did the stress test said that my blood pressure is constricting my pulmonary arteries causing my SOB. My BP has been ranging 94/50 to 110/76. I take half of a hydrochlorothiazide. My family doctor thought maybe its anxiety so she put me on Buspar. She doesn't yet know about the chest pressure or cough. The Buspar has not changed any of the physical symptoms. The specialist said after the RHC that maybe if it is in fact pulmonary hypertension; it maybe just too early to pick up.

287,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; Diagnosed with variable blood pressure. If I take my BP while seated or reclined - after relaxing; it is always hypotension (ie 68/40; 56/38)It gets even lower at night. If I've just walked in to do so; without relaxing first it always quite high (ie 168/135; 172/139) and takes a long while to come down. Given HCTZ (25mgs) for hypertension. Unable to tolerate Ace Inhibitor (Altace) and Beta Blocker (Inderal). (I take thyroid replacement hormone for hypothyroid and Inderal blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 hormone. The Altace raised creatinine levels). Being hypothyroid I really have to be vigilent about exercise; or the weight piles on. But; I'm really nervous about exercising now that I have this wonky BP. I always thought with hypertension a person's BP was up ALL the time. Are these kinds of WILD swings; common? Should I be limiting activity? I really don't have to do a lot to really raise it from hypotension to hypertension-just walk across the room - so what will exercise do to it? What causes such wide swings? I've struggled to finally get the hypothyroid meds optimized and within range; and I feel pretty good. Now I find out I have this weird BP thing too. What hypertension meds will not interfer with thyroid meds? Would you recommend a stronger diuretic (furosimide)? Does furosimide interfer with thyroid hormone replacement? Is there a hypertension med you'd recommend? Can thyroid CAUSE this variable BP problem? Can thyroid meds cause it? Should I be as scared as I am that my BP is all over the map?

Could this be from the meds? Also can your body build up a tolerance to meds over the years? Thank you for your advice and suggestions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Maria You should eliminate salt from your diet. In some patients this step makes their blood pressure much easier to control. You should also not take ibuprofen (found in Motrin or Advil); that whole class of medicines; called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents; can contribute to high blood pressure. Many nasal decongestants can contribute to high blood pressure. You should avoid alcohol and tobacco. If you are overweight; just losing 5 to 10 pounds can make a big difference. Of course; you should take your medicines every day and not skip doses. If you are taking certain herbal medicines; these can sometimes cause high blood pressure also. If the above measures don't work; you could be started on a fourth blood pressure medicine. Before doing that; I would make sure you do not have a rare cause of high blood pressure that would be treated surgically or kidney disease causing high blood pressure. Your doctor should know which tests to order to rule out the causes of secondary hypertension. I do not know what could be causing your headaches. Sometimes if blood pressure is very elevated it can cause headaches. Lightheadedness could be caused by blood pressure being too low. You do not build up a tolerance to these medicines over time. I hope this is useful. Good luck. Feel free to write back with further questions.

295,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I went to the doctor yesterday and I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure. I am really skeptical about taking this medication; or any medication for that matter. I am 21 years old and I cannot figure out why my blood pressure is high in the first place. I do have a lot of anxiety problems and I wonder if that contributes to it. I also take Paxil for my anxiety and I have been told that can cause high blood pressure. So my questions are: Is hydrochlorothiazide something that can be discontinued later after my blood pressure lowers or is it a drug that is meant to be taken long term? Has anyone had experience with Paxil causing high blood pressure? Thanks.,2011,2011,20.0,Male,,,hello I went doctor yesterday I prescrib hydrochlorothiazid blood pressur I realli skeptic take medic medic matter I 21 year old I figur blood pressur high first place I lot anxieti problem I wonder contribut I also take paxil anxieti I told caus high blood pressur So question Is hydrochlorothiazid someth discontinu later blood pressur lower drug meant taken long term ha anyon experi paxil caus high blood pressur thank

300,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Based on my analysis of blood tests; my 70-year old aunt currently has Stage 3b CKD and is actually close to Stage 4. Back in 8/2008; her GFR was 49.5. A year later; it's 32. This is a loss of 17.5ml/min over 12 months. Every test I looked at; her BUN (22-23); Creatinine (1.3-1.6) and Choloride (112) are elevated. I suspect it was out-of-control hypertension which caused her kidney function to deteriorate. I measured her BP at 200/110 several occasions over the weekend. She says she was stressed out on weekends. But her resting BP on weekdays was still around 160/100. I don't know what her internist has been doing but they apparently thought her hypertension was under control. She stopped taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg; something she was on; a while ago. I put her back on it and made an appointment with her internist so that a nephrologist can be seen. What are we looking at here? Am I correct in my analysis? I had to self-teach nephrology in 2 days! I'm more concerned about the rapid decline in GFR than her 3b being so close to 4. We just ordered her November blood results to be sent and I'm afraid to look at the results and see really how low her GFR has gotten this time.,2009,2010,70.0,Female,,,base analysi blood test 70year old aunt current stage 3b ckd actual close stage 4 back 82008 gfr 495 A year later 32 thi loss 175mlmin 12 month everi test I look bun 2223 creatinin 1316 cholorid 112 elev I suspect outofcontrol hypertens caus kidney function deterior I measur BP 200110 sever occas weekend she say stress weekend but rest BP weekday still around 160100 I dont know internist appar thought hypertens control she stop take hydrochlorothiazid 25mg someth ago I put back made appoint internist nephrologist seen what look Am I correct analysi I selfteach nephrolog 2 day Im concern rapid declin gfr 3b close 4 We order novemb blood result sent Im afraid look result see realli low gfr gotten time
301,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi there. I am a female; 19 years old; otherwise in good health and weight. My electrophysiologist recently put me on a beta blocker (Metoprolol) 25 mg twice a day for hypertension and a ton of other symptoms he said must be due to Neurocardiogenic Syncope. I was diagnosed with asthma a couple years ago and it seems as if the beta blocker is causing shortness of breath and a feeling that seems similar to how I feel after exercising; a sort of chest tightness I would say. Is this common for beta blockers to do to people with asthma? I am afraid that the dose will be increased as my blood pressure is still high (last two readings were 132/100 and 140/92). I am going to talk to my PCP tomorrow about it as well.,2008,2009,19.0,Female,,,Hi I femal 19 year old otherwis good health weight My electrophysiologist recent put beta blocker metoprolol 25 mg twice day hypertens ton symptom said must due neurocardiogen syncop I diagnos asthma coupl year ago seem beta blocker caus short breath feel seem similar I feel exercis sort chest tight I would say Is common beta blocker peopl asthma I afraid dose increas blood pressur still high last two read 132100 14092 I go talk pcp tomorrow well
302,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I recently suffered severe pain abdominal after taking Tylenol #3's for a migraine. I was told that codeine causes spasms of the sphincter of oddi. Felt like the most terrible gallbladder attack of my life - altho I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Since then; my abdomen just under my ribs on BOTH sides is really sore; but particularly bad on the upper left side; going into my back. Kind of a dull boring pain - unless I move suddenly without thinking - then its severe. I don't know if its coincidental that this came on after the 'oddi' incident or not. I DO have a small hiatal hernia. I take thyroid replacement hormone; Metformin 500mg 3 times a day with meals; and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. WOULD ANY OF THESE MEDS CAUSE THIS KIND OF PAIN? SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT PANCREAS PROBLEMS? STONES? WOULD THE HERNIA CAUSE THIS TYPE OF PAIN? I'm a 48 year old female.

307,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I just today had a doctor prescribe hydrochlorothiazide to me. I filled the prescription and then came home and phoned my oldest friend in the world; a 59 yr old Internal Medicine specialist to talk to him about it. His initial reaction was; and I quote; ""I wouldn't take that stuff!"". He told me that I should tell the first doctor that; after researching the hydrochlorothiazide; I am fearful of taking what he prescribed and that what I would like is for him to prescribe an ace inhibitor. I have NEVER liked taking pills and am not sure what to do. Any thoughts? I will be 59 yrs old in 3 months. btw; the first doctor also prescribed 81mg aspirin. My doctor friend back east told me that the most recent studies have shown that an aspirin regimen has little to no effect on someone until AFTER they have had a heart attack or other...

308,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 34 yrs old male; from India. I am overweight by 30 - 50 lbs. I try to exercise everyday and have developed fair stamina by exercising. I have an average to good physique. Till now; the only physical problem I have is Hypertension. I used to take Amlodopine 5 mg tablets fdaily or a long time [5-6 yrs]. Before 2 years the drug was chaged to 'Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide'. This is also a same 5mg tablet that I am taking daily. Recently my BP is more in normal range; even if I dont take the BP medication for a couple of days. I used to masterbate since I was 14. Have a very good sex drive. I think out of fear of impregnating my partner; whenever we do sex without a condom; I use to come very fast. But with a condom I can go on for 5-10 mins of thrusting apart from all the foreplay before it. - I used to follow the 'start and stop' method. Since last 2 months; I am noticing that; I do not have much control on my ejaculation. As soon as I proceed for penetration; I am coming too fast; even within 1 min. Sometimes as soon as my partner touches my penis. - Also; I am noticing that; I can not force the flow of my urine as I could do in past. Are both of these happenning because of weak PBG muscles?Can only kegel cure these? Should I stop my BP medication. Please suggest; what action should I take.

309,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern. What typically used to be 120-125/70-72 has started to creep up to systolic pressures in the 145-155 range with little or no change of the diastolic pressure. It seems as I age; presently 64; isolated systolic hypertension is beginning to appear as it did with my parents.

I always had around 115/70; but now it's been at around 125-130 and today it was 143 (although as I said; I was FILLED with anxiety at this visit...) The bottom number today was 73.

311,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 38 year old black male in excellent shape!! Two years ago I began having Palpitations which continues today. I reported my symtoms to the Flight Surgeon (FS). The Flight surgeon ordered an 24 hour monitor which showed I was having PVCs; about 4-5 per day. Also the monitor revealed I had a non-recurring 4-beat run of V-tack which brought about more test. I was given the Treadmill Stress test; Echo; Stress Echo; Calcium Florscope scan; chest X-ray; and a Thalium Stress test. All of the above mentioned test reveall my heart was normal no MVP or anything. The test however; did stress me a bit; so I now take 12.5mg Hydrochlorothiazide and 20mg of Zesttril daily for mild Hypertension. My BP is well controlled 116/72. My question is: Can an individual have a v-tack episode and have a normal heart; does one's heart need to be electrically or structural abnormal for this to take place? And what do I do about these PVC's? The FS say to forget about them until I am able to take a Bata-blocker after my Military flying career is over.

In addition; I suffered a stoke this spring when plaque in my Carotid artery broke free and entered the brain. Also; moderately high blood pressure necessitating the use of 40mg of Diovan each day; along with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide each day to control the blood pressure; along with statins to control cholesterol and hopefully gradually dissolve the plaque buildups. Now recently; my brother suffered a heart attack; putting him on ventilator; necessitating a transfer of him to a rehabilitation facility about 7 hrs away. Now; I have been driving the 14 hr trip every other week to visit with him. Now; my concern is; (I would normally take this up with my physician but I don't see him for another 2 months).....Am I at any greater risk of developing a clot (DVT) in the leg with the ulcer; leading to a pulmonary embolism....because of my circulatory issues with my leg and my high blood pressure ?

319,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I have taken a large amount of medications over the last 20 years: Depakote ER; Remeron; antipsychotic for short time; Hydrochlorothiazide; Atenenol; Trileptal; Luvox; Synthroid; Tiazac; Lipiter; insulin and some others. I have struggled most of this time with uncontrolable diarreahea. Eventually I started taking Imodium AD which helped to some extent. After a colonoscopy and tests for anything that shouldn't exist in the colon; ie: parasites etc. my surgeon told me my problem was all the meds I was taking (it was enough to kill me) that my colon is healthy. Working with my other doctors I have reduced a number of the meds without harm. I am still on meds for Diabetes; for Hypertension; and for Low Thyroid. Generally; I am in good health; physically and mentally active. However; I still suffer the diarreahea that comes in fits after I eat a meal and often when I am out shopping; or walking for excercise. I find the Imodium helpful to some extent; but I can never be sure it is enough to prevent sudden bouts of the diarreahea. I drink plenty of water daily to prevent dehydration and eat conservative meals. I have lost 30 pounds intentionally as I was overweight due to medications. There is no blood or ""fats"" in the stools. They are a normal medium brown in color; sometimes they have been very dark almost black. Seldom have I appreciated a solid stool. I have searched the internet regarding IBS; IB; Colitis; etc. and have yet to find my symptoms of anything to match. It is as though I have too much water in the colon to be absorbed normally and everything just washes out at its own will. If you have any thoughts regarding this matter; I would greatly appreciate them and anything I can do to correct my problem.

320,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 45 year old female and had a baby 3 months ago. I developed hypertension after she was born and was put on 200 mg Labetalol twice a day. It did what it was supposed to do; however I also developed post partum anxiety/depression and was put on Escitalopram; Alprazolam (as needed) and klonopin (1mg) at night only. The side effects of the labetalol for me were awful; so once my readings got better; I weaned off of it and am now not taking anything for Bp which usually stays in a good range (120-135 over 78-85). Some days it's a bit high and some days it's normal. 2 nights ago it spiked to 163/99 and my heart rate went down to 51. This concerns me as I had Bradychardia after my baby was born and the BP was high; but it went back to normal. It went back to normal/borderline over the past couple of days; however I also started taking Hydrochlorothiazide the morning after the spike (prescribed by my ENT for pressure and tinnitus in my left ear). So I guess my question is; is the low heart rate normal with that type of BP spike? They did an echocardiogram when I was hospitalized after my baby was born and said it was fine and my EKG's were fine; etc. Obviously with my anxiety; this still worries me. My cardiologist does NOT want to change my BP med; even though I told her that the side effects were bad on the labetalol and made my anxiety worse. I know there are a LOT of BP meds out there. I am not breast feeding; so that isnt' in the equation.

324,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

325,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello I've been diagnosed with PAC's for 25 years; noticed them from time to time but once diagnosed; never thought that much about them. They are not enjoyable; but at the same time; not that serious. About 3 years ago I had extensive lithotripsy (3K pulses) to remove a large kidney stone; since then I've had several other stones; none that required ESWT; but noticed a general rise in my B.P. It went; over a period of 2 or 2 1/2 years; from 130/82 to 180/107 on a regular basis. Suspicions arose that perhaps renal artery stenosis had occured and I was placed on a number of B.P. meds; none of which helped. My most recent MRA showed no stenosis of the main artery to either kidney. At the same time as the MRA; I was placed on Hydroclhlorothiazide. Within a few days; my blood pressure had dropped to 107/72; sometimes even lower. At the same time; my incidence of PAC's increased quite noticeably. I had been given propanolol to use if needed for the PAC's and took it rarely. Now I need it often twice a day. Is there any relationship between the lowered B.P. and increase in PAC's or am I just noticing them more due to the lowered B.P.? I can live with the PAC's as I much prefer that to the hypertension problem; just wondered if there is a connection. I'm taking; in addition to the hydrochlorothiazide; Benicar 20mg/day and Coreg 10mg/day.

I would feel ok one minute than the next I would have some diarrhea and some vomiting most recently I had a lot of vomiting diarrhea and when I get these episodes I would sweat profusely and get verry weak and tired. I would go to the emergency room and they would tell me that it either my diet change ( as per my Endocrinologist ) or most recently food poisoning ( I was told my white blood cell count was a little high; they didn’t give me antibiotics ) which is why they called it food poisoning or they’d say I had a drop in potassium/dehydration. I am getting so sick of not knowing what is going on and I’m sick of the pain; dizziness the weakness diarrhea and vomiting it happens every couple of months.

329,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"BACKGROUND: I'm 28 living in Madrid and recently given Losartan (100mg) hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) to control hypertension. Because I'm pretty young for hypertension this prescription was also accompanied by an extensive batter of tests (blood tests for kidney and liver function; ultrasound of heart; kidneys and major arteries; electrocardiograph) which all returned very normal results indicating primary hypertension. While I don't love the fact that I'm in my twenties and need medication for something I've always associated with much older people; it does run in my family on both sides and I'm glad that it's currently controlled. DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM: For several weeks I had been experiencing mild; but regular; pain in my abdomen/rectal region. It was relatively dull; and thus generally difficult to pinpoint where exactly; so generalizing it as lower abdominal and rectal pain. Unfortunately over the last two weeks it seemed to progress somewhat rapidly. Included things like pain in my lower back/sides; and a constant feeling of needing to stretch (bend over at the lower back). It was worsened after lots of walking and lessened somewhat when sitting/resting. TEMPORARY RESOLUTION: I understand that this is not a good idea; but after week of feeling like a problem was escalating I went off my blood pressure medication for 4 days to see if it could have been a side affect of the drug. Within 36 hours the pain was completely gone. I immediately made an appointment with my physician; at the time feeling relieved that I had identified the problem as a simple and reversible side affect and assumed that among the plethora of hypertension treatments out there that another one would likely be better tolerated. Additionally; the Mayo Clinic lists ""abdominal or stomach pain"" and ""lower back or side pain"" under ""more common side affects on its website. (http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/losartan-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20067341) Again; I understand the implication of going off medication without seeking professional advice first; but I was traveling in another country where I do not speak the language and was unable to reach my doctor by phone. I've discussed it with him and assured him that I'll be sure to get in touch with him before ever making a similar decision. Additionally; feeling that my several day test was enough to inform my conversation with my doctor; but not wanting to continue without his advice I went back on the medication and several hours later began noticing the abdominal and side pain (back pain seems more mild; but also manifested last to begin with). That seemed pretty definitive to me that I'm just not tolerating this treatment well. FOLLOW UP: So yesterday I had my appointment with him; and was surprised by the response. He said that losartan has no interaction with the GI tract and that he things my discomfort is caused by a lumbar nerve. He ordered a lumbar spine x-ray which I have on Monday; and prescribed ibuprofen. He asked if I've had diarrhea or constipation (I haven't been tracking closely; unfortunately but I don't think so); pain in my legs; and that's it. There was also zero physical examination of my back; and limited questioning about my back symptoms before ordering the x-ray; which struck me as unusual but I made the appointment for exam and follow up for next Tuesday. I also told him that I had some concerns about the diuretic (hctz) as I already urinate frequently; and I wondered if the addition of a prescription diuretic was ""overactivating"" my kidneys in some way. He dismissed that fairly quickly; and I'm not very concerned about my kidneys after all the initial testing; but trying to include the observation in all conversation. Last night I called my mother in the US (a nurse) who ran this all by a family friend who is a physician (internal medicine) who agreed that I should stay on the losartan/hctz (although he noted that he thinks 100mg/12.5mg is very aggressive first step into treatment); but was much more curious about bowel movements and whether or not I had experienced constipation or diarrhea. NEW QUESTIONS: I suppose more than a second opinion (although appreciated); I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with abdominal pain or back/side pain while on hypertension medications? If you were able to get past them; do you feel like I've left out critical information in my conversations with my doctor? Unfortunately because my Spanish language; and his English; are somewhat limiting our ability to communicate about this to the level I'd like I have to do a lot of preparation in advance of my appointments to make sure I can describe things well. Would love any input so I can try to more effectively describe what's going on and make sure he has all the information he needs; and hopefully having me a bit less confused.

331,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have been experiencing very bloated; swollen; painful; stiff ankles for about a year now.

332,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I have a perplexing case study for which I have been able to offer little help to this patient. I hope there is someone out there who knows about this condition or who can direct me to someone who does. She is a 66 y.o. white female who presented with cc of; ""I've got a burning sensation on my lips. I've had it for 20 years. I have gone to many different dermatologists; physicians and ENT's who have given me some creams to put on my lips; it hasn't helped and now my entire mouth is burning."" She stated that her palate; gums; lips and tongue burned and it would come and go. It gets a little worse as the day wears on. Her latest episode of it occurred after she brushed her teeth using Sensodyne toothpaste. Clinical exam showed no obvious reddening of the soft tissue areas. Pt. is taking several medications. They include: Ativan for depression; hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for hypertension and Benazepril (ACE inhibitor for hypertension); Imipramine 50 mg for depression; and 81 mg asiprin for prophylactic arteriovascularity; and hydrocodone for back pain(2 yrs; possibly addicted to Lortab). Burning Mouth Syndrome came to mind for me as top on the differential; but what is causing it? The patient swears that it all started after she got her braces on when she was about 46. ""they poked into my lips; which created sores and they've been burning ever since."" I suggested taking her off the ACE inhibitor. They have been shown to increase the incidence of BMS.

As of recent I have noted getting dizzy when standing or sitting down and experiencing vasodiatation of the head after exercise. As of recent I have been experiencing pressure in the head; a skipping of heart beat feeling; loss of short term memory and my resting rate is up to 84-90 and bp is at 98/82 sitting and at 118/100 when standing. I have had a complete brain MRI; blood work and all is fine. The change in my rhr and bp ( the closeness of the systolic and diastolic witht he fluctuations in it when sitting and standing) is conserning and the headaches are unbearible.

334,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI of 43.5 and a moderatively active lifestyle due to school/work. I walk 30 minutes every day; at a brisk pace. I have primary hypertension despite a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril (I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide but due to my IBS-D I ended up dehydrated and requiring FRT in the ED). Due to my HR being chronically low; I'm not a good candidate for beta blockers so I'm on Lisinopril which just can't seem to manage my BP. My average resting heart rate is 48! I have a pulsation visible in 4/10 nailbeds that coincides with my heart rate; I've since learned it's called Quickne's pulse. I can't remember the last time I DIDNT have edema in my feet and legs. Some days it's worse than others; but every day it's pitting edema. I get a tightness in my chest sometimes and I can't seem to catch my breath. I'm tired all the time. I've gone to my PCP and had several several blood panels; urinalysis; etc with no conclusive results. I've gone to the ED due to the pain in my chest and inability to catch my breath and was tucked away to finish the cardiac enzyme protocol then shipped home with some Maalox as if it was some acid reflux causing my feet; hands; arms and face to swell. SOMETHING isn't right. I'm frustrated and tired of getting the run-around.

335,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear Cleveland Clinic Physicians; Background: Male Age 65; high blood pressure; daily medicine doses: atenonol(50mg); vasotec(25mg); hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); imdur(30mg); lipitor(20mg); and aspirin(81mg). When I measure my blood pressure I take three consecutive measurements about 30 to 45 seconds apart. The first measurement is always highest(150/80); the second measurement(138/75); and the third measurement(125/72). What is the correct blood pressure? Is it the first measurement; the average of the three measurement; or the average of the second and third measurements? Also; I take these measurements three times a day and there is a variation. In the morning it is always highest and about an hour after dinner(6:00 PM) it is always the lowest. During the day the highest measurement may be 155/82 and the lowest measurement may be 106/60. Is it unusual for blood pressure to vary this much during the day? It seems as I am aging my systolic is beginning to creep some; however; my diastolic seems to remain normal. Is it time to tweak some of my medications to lower the systolic or should I wait to see if this continues for a few weeks? I first started noticing these changes for the last three or four days. Also; my blood pressure will be lowest about two hours after a 30 minute daily jog. Is there a blood pressure medication that would just treat the systolic and not the diastolic?

336,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I was taking Lotensin/Benazepril for a couple of hears for mild hypertension (~145/95) and it was being effective. A few months ago I started having various neurological symptoms including: 1) Numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. 2) Needle-stick like pains in my feet. 3) Trembling of my hands; arms; and thighs. 4) Feelings like being splashed by cold water in my legs; arms; and torso. I had some tests (an MRI of the cervical spine and an EMG/NCV) for possible herniated disk. The MRI was normal and the EMG was ""inconclusive"" according to the neurologist. The connection to the benazepril didn't hit me until one day. I stopped it and over the next couple of weeks the symptoms decreased markedly but not entirely. I had an appointment with my doctor and we talked about it and he changed be to lisinopril. I took it one time and about 2-3 hours after I took it the symptoms; all of them; were back stronger than ever. Especially the trembling. It's pretty clear to me that there is a cause-effect relationship here. So it's been about 3 weeks since I took the lisinopril and I'm back to where I was before I took it. I have some symptoms; mostly the tingling and the needle-like pains. I see that some of these symptoms; while uncommon; are associated with ACE inhibitors. So my questions are do you think these problems are actually caused by the benazepril and lisinopril? If so; are is the damage they may have caused permanent or should I see improvement over time? I'm obviously very leery about trying another hypertension med. I am seeing my GP doctor in a week.

338,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My husband died on July 5 while we were at our ranch in a very remote location. He had no history of any heart disease. His mother had arythmea; which was corrected surgically approximately 2 years ago; but no other familial heart disease. He was diagnosed with borderline hypertension approximately 5 years ago; but it was under control with the use hydrochlorothiazide. On the night of the 3rd; when we went to bed; he said his legs felt weird. Not painful; but heavy or numb. The next day; the 4th of July; he said he still didn't feel great; but he felt better. We drove to our ranch; which is in a very remote location; that day and did normal activities; driving around the ranch; etc. My husband grilled burgers for dinner. He had no strenuous activities after dinner. At midnight we went to bed; but he got up after about 10 minutes because he said he didn't think he'd be able to sleep. At 3 a.m. he woke me up to tell me we needed to leave because his heart was racing. He got in the truck; and I got up; and grabbed my purse and my phone. When I got in the truck approx. 2 min. later; he had a seizure. I dialed 911; and got the county EMS; who indicated they would send an ambulance. His breathing was extremely loud - almost like barking- for approximately 2 minutes. As I was driving toward the ambulance; I could hear him breathing; but he suddenly stopped just before we reached the ambulance (about 20 minutes after he woke me up). The EMTs did not start CPR for nearly 10 minutes; and did not seem to be in any hurry to do so. They drove the ambulance directly to the JP's house; who pronounced him dead approximately 40 minutes after my husband woke me up. The JP insisted it was a heart attack; and because this county doesn't have an ME; they have to rely on another county for autopsies. I was told that they absolutely would not do an autopsy because the JP was convinced it was a heart attack. I may never know why my husband died; but I'm hoping someone can tell me if they think this sounds like a heart attack or something else. Is there any way we could have known he was in trouble?

339,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I went yesterday for cataract surgery; this was canceled. My heat rate was 36 to 50 bpm; with pvc's about every 3rd beat. I have had a very low heart rate for at least 10 years; (39 to 44 bpm; resting) and a ""heart murmer"" since 12 years old; I'm now 74. I take Enalapril (5 mG); Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mG); and Lovastatin (30mG). My regular Dr wanted a second opinion before he would OK the cataract surgery. I went to a cardiac specialist who gave me an ""echo cardiograph"" and a stress test; on meeting with him a week later he classified me as ""a low risk for the surgery"". No mention was made of the pvc's at all; and he did take an EKG. When I took the stress test my heart rate went from 42 (resting) to 124bpm; and all was pronounced OK.

340,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. My blood pressure before I was put on medication was averaging about 160/95 on average; sometimes going into the 190/105+ ranges. I was recently put on Hydrochlorothiazide (25mg twice a day) to lower my blood pressure. This has helped lower it to somewhat but I'm still seeing the 140/90+ ranges constantly. I have had several EGKs; everything fine; chest x-rays - fine; blood tests - all good; and several urine tests which all came back good (except 1 last test). I am constantly having chest pain and have been having it on and off for the past couple weeks. The past week it has been especially bad. It is a constant pain; sometimes dull; sometimes sharp pains like someone is stabbing me with a knife in the heart and it will radiate to my left arm. I am very easily winded; like walking up stairs will make me breath heavy and I feel exhausted. Several times my heart rate has been 110-116 resting. The last time my heart was racing I had just gotten up for bed and was getting ready for work. I hadn't done anything physical; and only had a half a glass of pop. The doctor keeps telling me everything looks fine; and for some reason whenever I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal; yesterday it was 125/75. I immediately went home and checked my blood pressure and it was 145/89ish (after 5 minutes of resting peacefully). Every time I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal yet when I go home it's high. I honestly think either his machine doesn't work properly or he's taking the reading wrong. I have a good blood pressure monitor at home; and I follow the steps exactly as the manual states. The machine is rated for clinical accuracy within 5 points and other people who have tried it come back normal. I am worried that the readings my doctor is getting aren't accurate and he doesn't think it's as bad as it is. I've told him of my chest pains; how they come and go and get worse with moving around or doing light housework; etc; yet he feels I should be working. I have an extremely high stress job; sit for extremely long periods (my shifts are 12 hours); I work 2 days; 2 nights. Should I see another doctor? I really don't think I should be working until the pain is gone for good and my blood pressure is lower. I have no idea why the rapid increase in heart rate is happening either. The doctor thinks it could be the medication he put me on but it doesn't happen every day; only once in awhile. Any thoughts would be appreciated.,2008,2008,,,,,I recent diagnos hypertens My blood pressur I put medic averag 16095 averag sometim go 190105 rang I recent put hydrochlorothiazid 25mg twice day lower blood pressur thi help lower somewhat Im still see 14090 rang constantli I sever egk everyth fine chest xray fine blood test good sever urin test came back good except 1 last test I constantli chest pain past coupl week the past week especi bad It constant pain sometim dull sometim sharp pain like someon stab knife heart radiat left arm I easili wind like walk stair make breath heavi I feel exhaust sever time heart rate 110116 rest the last time heart race I gotten bed get readi work I hadnt done anyth physic half glass pop the doctor keep tell everyth look fine reason whenev I go see blood pressur come back normal yesterday 12575 I immedi went home check blood pressur 14589ish 5 minut rest peac everi time I go see blood pressur come back normal yet I go home high I honestli think either machin doesnt work properli he take read wrong I good blood pressur monitor home I follow step exactli manual state the machin rate clinic accuraci within 5 point peopl tri come back normal I worri read doctor get arent accur doesnt think bad ive told chest pain come go get wors move around light housework etc yet feel I work I extrem high stress job sit extrem long period shift 12 hour I work 2 day 2 night should I see anoth doctor I realli dont think I work pain gone good blood pressur lower I idea rapid increas heart rate happen either the doctor think could medic put doesnt happen everi day awhil ani thought would appreci

344,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello my name is Dale. I am 23 years old and since the age of early 21 I developed a very odd case of hypertension. Whereas my old blood pressures where in the 120/75 range suddenly I developed 160/90 blood pressure. Since then things have really gone downhill. I have developed pretty severe anxiety and basically dropped out of school about 1 1/2 years ago. That's not the worst; I have been dealing with severe heart palpitations and heart flutters in the last year; and about 3 months ago I suddenly developed shortness of breath that has stuck with me to this day. I was exercising pretty regularly up until this shortness of breath started and had actually managed to lose some weight; however since the shortness of breath started it has become nearly impossible; although I still manage to ride my bike even with the shortness of breath. Recently I consulted a Doctor of Osteopathy who performed some saliva tests on me and they showed that my cortisol levels were pretty elevated; im not sure if this consitutes Cushings but was wondering if you guys could comment. Also I should add that even on 3! Count it 3! Blood pressure medications Toprol XL 25; Losartan Potassium 100mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg I am still averaging high blood pressure readings 140-150/80 . When I went to the hospital with the shortness of breath it had climbed to 190/100 and at that time I was on only the HCTZ and the Toprol. So my cortisol Morning- 8.7 Midday-8.2 Evening-6.4 Night-4.3 Reference Ranges are supposed to be Morning- 2.0-10 Midday- 3.0-6.0 Evening- 2.0-4.0 Night- <1.5 Also my DHEA is elevated slightly at 671.1; supposed to be under 644. So I guess my main symptoms are 1. Shortness of Breath 2. High Blood Pressure 3. Heart Palpitations; flutters. 4.

346,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,History: 43 year old male w/ history of anxiety and panic disorder. These emotional disorders were in remission until a flare-up last August. At that time; I began psychiatric treatment with cognitive therapy; along w/ Klonopin .25 mg X 2; and Zoloft 25 mg. X 1. (I am still on this treatment; and the anxiety and panic is well under control.) Last August; during the height of my panic; my BP was at 150/95 and heart rate at 100. My cardiologist was convinced this was due to my emotional state; and said once my anxiety is under control; my BP will subside also. (I always had good BP and low HR in the 60's.) Cardiologist prescribed Toprol XL 25 Mg a day; and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day.....Now; with my anxiety under control I am getting morning readings of 115/70 with a HR of 56; and evening BP of 106/60 with HR as low as 49. My questions: 1) Is a HR that low dangerous? I'm feeling fine-perhaps a little more tired than before; but no fainting spells. 2) I see my cardio in November; and I'm sure he is going to take me off the meds.....Is there a weaning process involved ? 3) Can uncontrolled Anxiety really cause HBP?

347,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Maria on September 11; 1998 at 09:39:36: Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better.

348,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the ""world famous"" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it ""stabs and jabs""; another doctor called it ""electrical discharge headaches""; another doctor called it ""cluster headaches"". A previous doctor prescribed ""indomethecin""; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide. The pain is far beyond what any human should have to endure. .",2012,2012,49.0,Male,,,for the past 3 12 year ive similar symptom everi time I go emerg room one know basic humil doctor note recreat drug detect blood time longer Im total sober I excruci stab jolt pain feel though someon insid head hammer spike hammer sync beat heart I 1 4 strike within 4 5 second period If blood pressur high slight movement trigger strike If I think someth make angri instant strike occur each excruci strike send numb shock whole bodi higher diastol number intens strike pain strike If doctor shine littl red color light eye check pupil dialat I get immedi sever unbar strike go convuls violent uncontrol disturb bodi My entir bodi jolt beat headach strike the strike bad stop track Im forc ground Im 49 year old male I truck accid 05 3 epidur 1 lamenectomi diskectomi 08 leav disk deteri expand scar tissu L3 L4 along radiculopathi run left leg I also 5mm herniat L5 S1 I went world famou cleveland clinic seen neurologist Dr stewart tepper I offic everi bit 3 minut said take mani percoset sent detox well 2 year ago I stop take percoset still diseas So much percoset caus one doctor call stab jab anoth doctor call electr discharg headach anoth doctor call cluster headach A previou doctor prescrib indomethecin howev Dr stewart tepper said stop take along percoset If I keep blood pressur control I intermitt numb shock head bodi pain I current take clonidin hypertens along propanolol amlodipinewhich absolut noth hypertens hydrochlorothiazid I smoke 8 10 cigarett day ive alway love life fullest howev whatev diseas it debilit ive even attempt suicid the pain far beyond human endur
349,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I recently underwent a series of test: echo; ekg; stress test; and heart cath. My doctor said I have dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% and left bundle branch block. I have been receiving treatment for high blood pressure for several months. I am currently taking atacand 16mg twice a day; clonidine .2mg three times a day; hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day; norvasc 5 mg once a day; and K-DUR. My blood pressure is still not under control. My question is how much relation is there to the cardiomyopathy and my blood pressure? If my blood pressure is ever under control will the cardiomyopathy improve? What are the risks that the cardiomyopathy will worsen? Is it normal for blood pressure to be so resistant to mediciation? There are others we have tried (lopressor; cardizem; to name a few) with no results. I am 53woman and slightly overweight. My doctor says my blood work looks like a 20 year old (no problems).

350,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My mom was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia approx. 17 years ago. Priror to this she worked as a social worker and after she had me she retired and ran her own daycare out of our house. She seemed fine with it at this time although there may have been small hints of something not right in stories she told the relatives. She's currently 59 years old and in addition to schizophrenia she also has stage II hypertension; chronic headaches; a severe skin rash that leaves open sores over her body (especially when scratched) and sometimes her mouth will twitch to the side (kind of like bells palsy but it comes and goes). Since I was a child when she first developed most of these symptoms I can't recall the exact order in which they occured however I have included them here because I beleive they may be somehow related. She's currently on hydrochlorothiazide and propanalol to control her headaches and hypertension. I'm wondering if one of these medications could also be causing her rash. Her schizophrenia symptomps display as paranoid thoughts beleiving she is being spied upon by 'the neighborhood'; especially the police; school teachers and the liquor store people. She has extreamly poor hygine; rarely baths and goes months without doing the dishes or cleaning up making her house smell really badly. She can become extreamly abusive especially when confronted and asked to acknoledge her problems. When I was a child I remember her occasionally telling odd stories to the relatives however she seemed much better able to take care of herself. Her hygine was much better; she drove longer distances; etc. When she was first diagnosed we brought her to UCLA medical center because she would randomly walk into the neighborhood and keep walking with no where to go. She was treated there for a while and seemed to get better and sent home with medication (although I can not remember which medication it was). Sometime after this I found her lying in bed; slurring her words and cussing really fowl things I had never heard her say before; swearing over and over again. She had taken many boddles of her medicine (I think it may have been hadol or another drug in it's class at that time (approx. 1985). I called the paramedics and they rushed her to the hospital and gave her charchol to neutrialize it. I believe that her overdose may have made her illness much worse. I do not remember her being so absuive before this point; and now she routinely swears and curses at everything. Also afterwards is when I beleive she developed her facial twich and she used to sit in the car stare into nowhere and roll her fingers together. She wasn't on the anti-psychotics for long but could the overdose have given her tardive dyskenia or caused her to be that much more absusive? Is there anything I can do to help her now?,2003,2003,59.0,Female,,,My mom diagnos paranoid schizophrenia approx 17 year ago priror work social worker retir ran daycar hous she seem fine time although may small hint someth right stori told rel she current 59 year old addit schizophrenia also stage II hypertens chronic headach sever skin rash leav open sore bodi especi scratch sometim mouth twitch side kind like bell palsi come goe sinc I child first develop symptom I cant recal exact order occur howev I includ I beleiv may somehow relat she current hydrochlorothiazid propanalol control headach hypertens Im wonder one medic could also caus rash her schizophrenia symptomp display paranoid thought beleiv spi upon neighborhood especi polic school teacher liquor store peopl she extreamli poor hygin rare bath goe month without dish clean make hous smell realli badli she becom extreamli abus especi confront ask acknoledg problem when I child I rememb occasion tell odd stori rel howev seem much better abl take care her hygin much better drove longer distanc etc when first diagnos brought ucla medic center would randomli walk neighborhood keep walk go she treat seem get better sent home medic although I rememb medic sometim I found lie bed slur word cuss realli fowl thing I never heard say swear she taken mani boddl medicin I think may hadol anoth drug class time approx 1985 I call paramed rush hospit gave charchol neutrial I believ overdos may made ill much wors I rememb absuiv point routin swear curs everyth also afterward I beleiv develop facial twich use sit car stare nowher roll finger togeth she wasnt antipsychot long could overdos given tardiv dyskenia caus much absus Is anyth I help

352,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I'm a 41 yr old female; 5'3""; 130lbs and recently had a abnormal echo stress test. I then had a left catherization done and was diagnosed with ""hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction"". I am on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide meds of which I take 1/2 tablet of a 12.5 mg tablet daily. My cardiologist stated that the diastolic dysfunction is caused by untreated high blood pressure; but I've been on blood pressure meds (hydrochloritiazide) for over 3 years prior to getting this latest diagnosis. My question is whether or not there are any other possible causes of diastolic dysfunction. I've had other symptoms over the last few years (fatigue; weakness/loss of strength; numbness in hands/feet; dizziness; foggy memory; slight carpal tunnel in both wrists per EMG test) and have undergone a few tests (checking for Rheumatoid Arth.; Lupus; EMG test) all of which came back normal. My blood pressure has always been low; in fact too low (81/48 lately) since I've been on the blood pressure meds. I'm just trying to find out if there may be another root cause of why I'm not feeling well. I have two young kids (4yrs and 9yrs) and have actually had a doctor tell me ""you feel tired all the time because of the kids"". Well; I'm not buying it.

353,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life.

354,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted by Ray on June 05; 1999 at 11:49:17 Several years ago it was discovered that I have a horseshoe kidney. Each urinalysis for the past 10 years has indicated blood in my urine. Is this to be expected with this congential condition? Also; recently; I had a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with Bactrim DS. This is the first infection I have had in ten years. One additional question; will diuretics such as Bumetanide or Hydrochlorothiazide have a harmful effect with horseshoe kidney? Is a calcium channel blocker; such as Verapamil; acceptable for hypertension with horseshoe kidney? Posted by HFHS M.D.-CK on June 08; 1999 at 12:47:58 Dear Ray; Horseshoe kidney is a common anomaly with about 1/400 being affected. It is more common in males. Horseshoe kidneys are fused together across the midline. Horseshoe kidneys may be associated with skeletal; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal ; or genitourinary abnormalities as well. One third of patients remain entirely asymptomatic. When symptoms are present; hematuria; stones; infection; and blockage of urine flow are seen. Vesicoureteral reflux and an increased incidence of urologic cancers has been reported. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil are acceptable to use with a horseshoe kidney. This information is provided for general medical information purposes only. Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition.

He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate.

No headache till after vision restored; then headache grew to disorienting proportions by night. Discontinued bcp's. Never recurred. age 35; referred by gyn to renal/hypertension dr-good workup; hbp; prescribed Procardia-I didn't like what I read about it; never started meds; never rtnd; no symptoms at the time. Renal clearance/labs wnl. Cholesterol ~220. (Hx recurrent UTI's once a year over 10yr period; culminated in passing of ""grit"" with ultrasound showing renal ?pyramids? and mildly fatty liver. UTI's never recurred after ""grit"" episode. Ouch.) age 40; heart ct for a study showed arteriosclerosis-80% of my age group better than I. age ~41; allergies started after severe exposure to kitty litter dust and a throat sinus ear infection that went untreated too long. Since then tb test +; chest xray neg; possible latex allergy; cat/dog/horse/maple tree allergy; flu shot reaction; mosquito bite reaction; peanut butter reaction; severe reaction to bactrim and balloons-both prev no problem-face like blowfish w balloons; large hives and tiny blood blisters w Bactrim. Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; ""crossed the border to mild asthma"" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the ""stroke."" I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My ""chart"" is 1/2"" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead. I do not agree with the hormone therapy for menopausal women-but I know it offers some cardiovascular protection? Here comes the wacko question-is anyone in the medical field currently prescribing bloodletting for menopausal women?

360,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I was diagnosed as mildly hypertensive a few years ago (now 47 y/o; ns; nd; normal weight and lipid profile). I ran about 150-160/90's before; now run 130-140/mid-upper 80s on 20 mg Lisinopril qd. I feel like this isn't low enough. I recently had an MRI/MRA of my head for unrelated reasons; and the report came back with changes ""most consistent of involutional small vessel white matter changes beyond upper limits of normal for patients age. Consider small vessel ischemic risk factors such as untreated hypertension."" Does this mean I need better control of my hypertension?

My pulse is rarely lower than mid 90's (80's at rest). Thyroid functions ok. My doc says not to worry; that this is fine.

361,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond. The extent of coverage of the pain is only pinpoint area on my chest and forearm. They appear and disappear right at the same time. There is no accompanying tachycardia; shortness of breath; or palpitation. Neither is it associated with heavy physical exertion. Have you had patients with this kind of chest and arm pain?

364,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi ; I am a long time member of this forum. On 2008 I finished 1 year Interferon + Ribavirin tx. Since then I feel very well; beside that the liver disease left me with mild Rosacea. About 3 years I started to have mild Hypertension and I decided to take meds - Co-Diovan (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE / VALSARTAN) since then. The blood-pressure was not high but I decided to take meds rather then do jogging every day. Only recently I notices that Urea (B) and Uric-Acid cam above normal right after I started with Co-Diovan. I also started 2 years ago with Avodart and Xatral against slightly enlarged prostate. Recently I had pain in the Thumb toe. family doc gave me diet against Gout. Also I did X-ray for a periodical checkup and the doctor (another doctor) now suspect that I maybe have Ankylosing spondylitis. I am worried. Tomorrow I will make some blood-tests. I would be happy for information. Are there any now relationships between those diseases and HCV or Interferon or the hyper-tension meds that I am taking ? I would be happy for any good information.

366,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type ""A"" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise. Would this be enough or is medicine the only way to go? thanks for all your time and help",2006,2006,40.0,Male,95.0,182.0,Hi Im 40 year old male 6ft 210 lb I recent heart ultrasound check free health screen everyth blood flow volum aaa screen fine No sign plaqu anyth I told I iv measur 14 high I assum 14 mean 14 cm diamet I told I discuss doctor next visit I ask I high BP ill admit I type A BP run borderlin I abl bring last year ten fifteen year ago ran 140150mid 90 last year 120130mid 80 I refus medic except daili dose hctz Id like control lifestyl adjust I also use fair share weightlift 20 year ago thi first heart screen I baselin go It free screen I assum may fair variat rate well My BP littl high screen I dont know consid well Q could tell would consid normal iv bad read Im truli 14 Is histori borderlin high BP like caus can number vari day day can reducedimprov what best way improv I could stand lose lb better cardio exercis would enough medicin way go thank time help
367,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"hi. I am a 21 year old male who is 5'9"" and weighs 160lbs. I NEVER smoke or drink caffeine; and I run four sessions of 3 miles/22 min. of cardio each week. I limit drinking to the weekends (and even then it's minimal); and I do not exceed 1500mg of sodium content daily. I consider myself very healthy and have never had health issues; surgery; or been on meds. nothing at all until now - just out of nowhere. about three weeks ago I had a terrible upper respiratory infection; which sent me to the doctor. he took my BP there and was shocked to learn it was in the 190/105 range; so he ran an EKG and breathing test and both were fine. to be cautious he sent me to the ER; where they performed a urinalysis and another EKG. both were fine. keep in mind; by the time I got to the hospital (10 min later); my BP was down to 156/94 or so. went back to the doctor a week or so later and my BP was still in the high range - now 170/95 or so. he wanted me to go to the ER again; but I refused - saying I prefer taking care of it there since I can't afford to pay $3000 again (I have bad insurance) for the ER. he said fine and prescribed me 5mg of lisinopril and told me to buy a home blood pressure monitoring machine. I have been taking lisinopril and using the monitoring machine I bought (Omron HEM-790IT) for about two weeks now. BP was high at the beginning; but the past week or so has gotten quite better. in the mornings and at night it is around 125/80; and when I return from school/work it is at the most 140/90. I understand the latter number is no good; but I figured it wasn't anything severe enough that an even better diet couldn't change. but again. my diet is already pretty good now here's the odd part: after a week or so of these readings being between 125-140; I went to the doctor's for the first time in two weeks expecting at least SOME improvement. after all; I have been eating extremely healthy; drinking tons of water; and taking lisinopril - in addition to the fact my home BP machine shows readings that are just pre-hypertension or barely stage 1. but when he took my BP; it was STILL in the 170s. I was shocked and he just let out a sigh of disappointment. he prescribed me hydrochlorothiazide to take along with lisinopril; and told me to come back tomorrow after taking a dose of both tonight and tomorrow. he also told me to bring my BP machine; just to compare readings. now; I know what white coat hypertension is; but I thought it only allowed your BP to raise maybe 10 points above normal. I certainly did not anticipate a growth in 30-40 points! I am extremely stressed about this situation... I'm only 21 years old; work out a lot; eat healthy; don't smoke... why is this happening to me? I initially thought it was just due to my respiratory infection; but that has been gone for almost 2 weeks and my high BP is still present. I'm a college student so I am somewhat stressed; but nothing too severe. I feel fine - never any headaches; aches; or anything like that. the only thing that's stressing me out right now is this darn BP. it just seems like I can't do anything...

368,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I've had Progressive M S for over 4 years now. I seriously thougth I had dealt with all those issues faily well till WAM! In Feb this year I began having seizures! Big ones; little ones; jelly bean jumping full seziures. Treatment was MASSIVE intravenous bags of Steriods.? By May they had all stopped thank you God! But the results from the steriods was extreme! I had gained over 25 lbs! In less than 4 months! In the past week my insurance had changed manufacturers and my medication for Hypertension; TrianterenW/hctz 37.5/25 ""CAPSULE""; was replaced with a ""TABLET""! On them for about 12 days and I noticed my feet are swelling more and more and more and still swelling! From both legs starting at the kneecap-all the way down to the almost hidden toes. And walking is excruciating! I elevate; drink lots of water (admittedly not every day prior to this time)-cause I am a Diet-Pepsi 'aholic..lol Of course I called the mail order company and they said-sorry your insurance changed in june and now we use Mfg. Sandoz. No replacement possible. I tried using my mom's (i know I know-but it was my old kind); just until I can see my Dr. Nothing!...I even drank water like crazy! My daughter is a Paramedic so when i told her of the problem she asked me to push down on the ankle area and tell her what I saw. I said the dent is still there! It won't re-inflate; so to speak. What does that mean? She said are you having trouble breathing? I said no. She said Physicians diagnose patients by a level of this method; and call the Dr. asap for a visit. Thats 2 days away and now I am a little freightened. I have tried ice; elevation; water and nothing makes it go down. I even wake to the swelling! She asked if I had injured my leg or back at some point recently? The only thing that comes to mind is last week my knee tried to keep giving out on me and had a hard throb to it. I put ice on kept it up and went on with my life. Nothing is changing it. Any ideas about this and has anyone else been through this? Is it M S related?

369,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was ""a little off"" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested?

370,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I went to get my first B12 injection the other day and I was shocked that the doctor didn't put on gloves to give the injection. Is this common? Also; they prescribed phentermine (30mg) and the water pill triamterene/hydrodcholrothiazide (75 mg). Since I have high blood pressure; I really want to avoid taking the phentermine since it elevates your heart rate. Has anyone used just the water pill and B12 (along with sensible diet and exercise; of course) with success or is the majority of weight loss help from the phentermine? Finally; has anyone in Los Angeles used the services at Westchester Wellness & Weight Loss? They're nearby and I was thinking about trying them...

372,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor. Can anyone give me suggestions I'm to young and on to many pills and refuse to be disabled but it looks like that's not gonna be my choice if something doesn't change soon; thanks.,2016,2016,30.0,Male,,,I 30 year old male I guess ill start begin I rememb when I 8 I diagnos osgood slaughter diseas start bad arthriti knee made difficult play play sport I still throughout childhood I alway felt tire sluggish energi drive mild hypertens I alway slightli averag size weight muscular I also suffer stomach issu throughout childhood lot diarrhea constip never regular In 2008 I ruptur larg intestin told multipl doctor ga I went eras CT scan nearli week pass I extrem amount infect cut open remov lot small larg intestin bad clean infect multipl organ they diagnos diverticul I mani antibiot time In 2012 start multipl high blood attack I would taken error BP around 220 150 they start hydrochlorothiazid didnt work ad benazepril amlodipin help littl bit work way back then ad prozac buspiron xanax need found lot blood pressur attack anxieti In 2014 I sever pain feet found I larg heel spur feet In 2015 march ear ach side head swell colliflow ear alway problem antibiot work start augmentin didnt work put ciprofloxacin doctor often thing work infect 3 week antibiot I also end bad yeast infect everytim take antibiot In juli I anoth issu intestin diagnos crohn hospit day bad crohn attack fill antibiot gastrointestin doctor start prednison I took month till around septemb had worst withdraw symptom I crawl step took ween A week I prednison I start bad lower back pain My doctor gave flexeril didnt work pain got wors next month In januari 2016 I I could work sleep sit without extrem pain I mri done I 10 bulg disc 5 herniat In mid lower back multipl bone spur vertebra worn size I first 3 steroid epidur shot februari work week never pain spread area pain worsen I also bone spur mani joint hip shoulder finger the past month felt like someth eat bodi insid Im extrem pain get wors night take forev get go morn whenev I take break pain med dont work I take nsaid stomach bleed tri nerv pain pill Im allerg I feel like someth caus doctor cant figur health fall rapid pace Im still work hard past day feel like hip fall place I read candida wonder bring doctor can anyon give suggest Im young mani pill refus disabl look like that gon na choic someth doesnt chang soon thank
373,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,It appears that any significant amount of protein in any form creates several painful and uncomfortable side effects in my body when consumed. This includes meat; eggs; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. For example; if I consume eggs then I get persistent headaches; brain fog; heart pain; increased blood pressure (I’ve had spikes to 165/105); numb and prickly skin; stiff neck muscles/tension; a burning pain in my kidneys; a changed sense of smell (I start smelling a particular thing that isn’t there and/or my skin is creating some kind of specific smell); and in general I just feel like I’ve been poisoned. Any form of exercise increases the severity of the side effects and causes additional pain. Eggs and seafood appear to create the worst side effects; but I get the same or similar symptoms to a lesser extent when eating other types of meat; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. This has lead me to start eating a heavily non-protein rich vegetable and fruit based diet; and has helped my side effects and blood pressure significantly; but this means I have to avoid almost all “normal” food. Does anybody have any clue what might be wrong? I have asked my kidney doctor; but he doesn’t even make an attempt at explaining to me what might be the problem. I have listed a bunch of medical information and history below in case it is helpful. Any ideas at all are appreciated.

378,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better. Thank you for your help and I am grateful for this forum. Dear Maria; Topic Area: Hypertension High blood pressure; or hypertension ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active - exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. Q: How does medicine help control high blood pressure? A: For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Q: Will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? A: Generally; someone with high blood pressure will be on lifelong medication. Q: At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? A: Usually hypertension can be managed by a Internal Medicine doctor. Q: Will there ever be a right combination (of medication) to treat this condition? A: It may take several trials to find the right combination of drugs. There are many different medications and new ones are coming out each year. Q: My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? A: Heart disease tends to run in families. Those who have a family history of heart problems shoud take extra care of themselves (i.e. weight loss; high blood pressure control; exercise; etc.). Q: Is 250 BP reading Max (85%) on this treadmill a bad reading warranting the patient on BP meds the rest of one's life? A: Not necessarily. But this is an abnormal result and is weighed into the decision to recommend starting medication. Q: Does readings like I indicated above warrant BP medication...Did the 130/80 at the start of this Thallium Test mean that this number is ""not Normal"" either ? A: Normal BP is 120/80 or less.

379,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Several months ago; I wrote to you about some studies' that show Fish Oil Supplementation has a tendancy to INCREASE LDL. Well; apparently; that seems to hold true; at least in my case. Before Fish Oil my lipids were: TC-180 and Direct LDL-87. Only 6 months later; without a dietary change; my lipids went to TC-235 and direct LDL of 150. Tri's remained boderline high at 170-200. My cardiologist is having my blood retested this week; as he thinks a lab error occured. (1) Is it possible in 6 months for a TC and LDL to Increase that much without significant dietary change? (2) Are Lab Errors Common? (3) The only other medication I added between tests were Zoloft; hydrochlorothiaizide and Toprol XL-Would any of those have a lipid effect? (4) What is the current thinking on Fish Oil-Friend or Foe?,2003,2004,,,,,sever month ago I wrote studi show fish oil supplement tendanc increas ldl well appar seem hold true least case befor fish oil lipid tc180 direct ldl87 onli 6 month later without dietari chang lipid went tc235 direct ldl 150 tri remain boderlin high 170200 My cardiologist blood retest week think lab error occur 1 Is possibl 6 month TC ldl increas much without signific dietari chang 2 are lab error common 3 the medic I ad test zoloft hydrochlorothiaizid toprol xlwould lipid effect 4 what current think fish oilfriend foe

I've been prescribed lasix and spironolactone and it helps but it only helps to get me to go to the bathroom more I don't really think it minimizes the swelling. Anyways I have two questions for y'all as I know there's at least two other ppl on this forum who take these direutics. 1. What if the Lasix stops working; is there another direutic I can take that you know about? 2. I'm really apprehensive about taking the Spironolactone because I know it helps remove ascities from the belley and if you don't have ascities in the first place; does it create a new elimination route to remove the ascities?,2008,2011,,Male,,,I daili fight go swell feet lower leg hand ive prescrib lasix spironolacton help help get go bathroom I dont realli think minim swell anyway I two question yall I know there least two ppl forum take direut 1 what lasix stop work anoth direut I take know 2 Im realli apprehens take spironolacton I know help remov asciti belley dont asciti first place creat new elimin rout remov asciti

382,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"PART 1 My non medical opinion. Highly technical discussion of MELDNa calculators vs MELD of Na factor. I kindly suggest that you do not read further especially if you easily get frightened about test results. This is about various ways of MELD scoring including Na factor and where it might apply. It could cause unnecessary fear; be incorrect and/or not apply to your specific situation. These scores can only be evaluated by a hepatoligist or an gastroenterologist experienced in HCV; hepatology and Cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate or severe hepatic impairment; CTP class B or C) should be referred to a medical practitioner with expertise in that condition (ideally in a liver transplant center). (DISCLAIMER) All comments by myself or other members are our own opinions and do not imply professional medical advice. Direct quotes with links provided should be source evaluated. My suggested non exclusive criteria include: 1. Professional medical opinion or another non -medical opinion. 2. Is the Professional medical opinion based on 1 or more doctors; the degree of opposing opinions and general consensus. 3. The strength of the supporting facts of the opinion such as case studies; Clinical Trial Phase; Type and numbers I respectively ask that before commenting that you read this entire text and links if needed. Familiarize yourself with a limited basic idea of the discussion and not go too far off topic. __________________________________________________________________________ Introduction I created this discussion based on my observation of the MELD-Na calculator when entering my sodium blood serum results after 1 week of treatment. I guess i have developed a ""hobby"" of playing with them to see various outcomes suggested. Background technical information if needed _____________________________________________________________________________ http://hepatitisc.uw.edu/browse/all/core-concepts 2.4 Evaluation an d Staging of Liver Fibrosis 2.5 Evaluation and Prognosis of Patients with Cirrhosis Importance of Distinguishing Compensated versus Decompensated Cirrhosis: Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score (CTP): Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) (especially have a layman's understanding) History and Background Used to predict what patients should be listed and in what order for liver transplant. The higher the MELD score; the lower the 3-month survival Calculation of MELD Score Limitations Clinical Use NOTE: Some of the core concepts have been updated at different times and may not reflect the current situation. __________________________________________________________________________________ The Meld calculators The Meld calculators can be varied updated and may have have different additional criteria including Na results and/or other including algorithms. http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/model-end-stage-liver-disease The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. Mayo Clinic researchers published the original MELD model in 2001. Refinements have been developed since then. These models are for use by medical professionals. The MELD Model The MELD-Na Model The MELD Model; UNOS modification There are more but mainly looking at MELD vs MELD-Na Model Another hosted by The Bologna Liver Oncology Group (BLOG) University of Bologna - ITALY in italian but can be google translated but you should be able to guess what input is needed. This auto show the results for different MELD calculators all at once. http://www.livercancer.eu/calculators.html NOTE this show two including Na with different results and have been unable to find out much yet about the differences One other one http://gihep.com/calculators/hepatology/meld-na/ _______________________________________________________________________________ Discussion with my guesses included and/or lack of specific knowledge unless confirmed by medical source. 1. The basic and updated MELD calculators use On Dialysis :Yes/No ; Minimum values must be 1 Creatinine 1.0 or less mg/dL is 1;0 Total Bilirubin :1 or less mg/dL is 1.0 INR 1.0 or less ratio is 1.0 because figures less than 1.0 because the natural logarithm of 1 is 0 and a value less than 1 would yield a negative value. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample; raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical system used. No units are used 2. The lowest possible score is 6 usually mean just over 1% chance of dying in the next 3 months. So who does this apply to with HCV? a) Not to those with confirmed F2\F3 or lower without any reason or test to confirm F4? b) MELD would apply to F4 Class B or C c) What about F3/F4 well compensated? The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically. and Ascites Grade 1: mild; only visible on ultrasound and CT it is possible to miss these. Either a less recent test; a doctor without the treatment experience/knowledge of cirrhosis/hepatology and/or a patient not mentioning very mild symptoms that seem chronic (don't want to be seen as weak or a complainer) could be reasons. 3.

383,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I am praying that someone will be able to help me. I am a 32 year old female that was diagnosed with Type diabetes at age 15. I have been on insulin from then and for the last 4 or 5 years I have been on a pump. My HBA1C Levels have been good so I have no issues with my diabetes as far as I am concerned. I was diagnosed with Poly CysticOvarian Syndrome...I have never had normal periods and I have always had to deal with acne. In order to conceive my first two kids I did like 5 cycles of Clomid with each. All pregnancy's were normal. About 5 years ago; I just started with shortness of breath. It felt as though an elephant was sitting on my chest and I couldn't get the deep breath in. In order to get a deep breath in I would have to try and force a yawn and after several attempts at forcing the yawn I might get lucky as to drawing the breath in. I have been to the emergency room on numerous occasions and because my pulse ox was always 99 they would basically dismiss me. I also have most relief lying flat on my back with my arms extended so I feel like I am opening up my rib cage. When I lay on my side I can barely breathe because it is like my rib cage is collapsing and can't expand to get air in. They have tried me on advair or singular and stuff like that because they said I have asthma (diagnosis which I still don't believe) but it doesn't work or help me out. I was referred to the cardiologist and was told I have Mitrial Valve Prolapse...(Which till today I still don't believe that diagnosis) and was put on lopressa but the medication would drop my blood pressure so low that I couldn't stand up. So that medication was stopped. After that they told me I was mental and had anxiety (zoloft; adavant and the one people always get high on); in which I think they told me that because they didn't know what was going on. I am always tired and the things I use to do its kinda hard to do them anymore because I just have no drive; stamina or energy to follow through. The only other medicine I was on in addition to my insulin was the birth control pills and my doc decided that I should stop them; but I got pregnant that very month...considering I had PolyCysticOvarianSyndrome and paid to have my first two kids; I guess that was a blessing. I had another baby and she just turned 2. I am now on Mirena which is a kind of IUD. My hair is also brittle and combs out no matter how much I do treatments for it. Over the last few months I have started with balance problems in addition to the shortness of breath. What would happen is when I get up I would have the ""almost"" blackout effect as I would call it; its like I am so disoriented that I just have to hold on; it is not the roller coaster feeling that comes with vertigo but it lasts for about 30-40 seconds and I just have to catch myself so I don't fall. This has started happening more frequently; when I bend down to wash my face and get back up or bending over to brush my teeth or even just closing my eyes; I sway all over the place. Its like shutting off an electrical breaker and cutting it back on quickly; so there is like a glitch in the system which cause just a temporary loss of power and then it resumes where it left off. I also get the dots of flashing lights when this happens and it honestly is just a bad feeling of the constant rocking and swaying motion. I went to my doc for my pap smear a few weeks ago and I told him what was going on and he was like noooooo this is not normal. They referred me to the Cleveland Clinic over there in Florida. (I am from the islands so medical facilities/ resources aren't the best). When I went there I had a neurology consult and a cardiology consult. They did a brain mri and a few other tests. One of them showed that the pressure in my ears was abnormal and the doctor told me to do therapy to ""train my brain"" to deal with the swaying.....at which I asked him if I was to just live with it? His response was basically yes. I was like but I have not lived with this all my life; and I understand the concept of developing a disease and treating it but I know the cause of my diabetes; my pancreas stopped working. BUT to tell me that I just need to accept it and live with it is unacceptable because we still don't know what is causing it. I went up to International patients department who scheduled all my appointments etc and busted out crying and requested a second opinion. He gave me 12.5mg a day of hydroclorothiazide a day and although it has help the swaying some the medicine makes the shortness of breath a little harder to deal with because when I take in the breaths it causes the area around my heart; the bone included to hurt. I am trying taking the medicine every other day because it is a capsule and honestly I don't think it is helping effectively. International Patients sent me to the ENThroat doctor and he recommended some other balance tests etc including a tilt table test but everyone seems to be missing something because I feel all of the symptoms I am having are tied together. It has been 5 years now that I have been dealing with this and it is taking a serious toll on me. As it stands all my symptoms are: Rocking and swaying blurry vision on and off- one day I can see clearly and others its blurry lack of energy no stamina shortness of breath sharp pains when drawing a deep breath decreased libido hair breakage blacking out with out actually blacking out and I usually have a minty feeling within my head; somewhat tingly Medications I am on: Novolg insulin in the pump- no more than 45 unites per day that includes basal and bolus doses. Roaccutane- 20mg a day to clear up the acne finally- I have been on it for the last 7months and the only side effect was dry lips. Mirena- inserted in 2009- has a 5 year duration Hydrochlorothiazide- 12.5 mg every other day I have just finished my roaccutane treatment and this is the first time since I was about 14 that my skin has been clear. Confirmed Diagnosis: Diabetic-Type 1 PolyCysticOvarian Syndrome RESULTS from Cleveland Clinic Tests: MRI BRAIN and IAC's without and with gadolinium- Their impressions were: 1. No enhancing lesions post gadolinium. 2. Mildly prominent cisterna magna. Slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricals. 3. Non specific UBO's in the white matter with the largest being about 4-5mm in the medial left temporal lobe. This could represent demyelination; vasculitis; migraine; a normal varient or ischemic change. 4. No evidence of mass or enhancing lesion involving the IAC's on either side. 5. Left maxillary sinusitis with hypertrophy of the turbinates. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Electrocochleography ECoG: Their impression: 1. Today's results are most consistent with the normal transmission time through the lower auditory system in both ears; there is no electrophysiological evidence of the VIII nerve or pontine level auditory pathway lesions. 2. ECoG examination was ABNORMAL in both ears; presenting electropsysiological evidence of increased labyrinthine pressure in BOTH ears. TESTS they have recommended which are not scheduled until the middle of September: 1. Audiogram and eng 2. Tilt Table test I know this was long winded...but any help/input would be GREATLY appreciated. Any recommendations for tests; the type doctor to go to; anyone who has experienced this type thing; anyone who knows of anyone who has experienced this type thing......JUST HELP PLEASE.",2011,2011,32.0,Female,,,I pray someon abl help I 32 year old femal diagnos type diabet age 15 I insulin last 4 5 year I pump My hba1c level good I issu diabet far I concern I diagnos poli cysticovarian syndromei never normal period I alway deal acn In order conceiv first two kid I like 5 cycl clomid all pregnanc normal about 5 year ago I start short breath It felt though eleph sit chest I couldnt get deep breath In order get deep breath I would tri forc yawn sever attempt forc yawn I might get lucki draw breath I emerg room numer occas puls ox alway 99 would basic dismiss I also relief lie flat back arm extend I feel like I open rib cage when I lay side I bare breath like rib cage collaps cant expand get air they tri advair singular stuff like said I asthma diagnosi I still dont believ doesnt work help I refer cardiologist told I mitrial valv prolapsewhich till today I still dont believ diagnosi put lopressa medic would drop blood pressur low I couldnt stand So medic stop after told I mental anxieti zoloft adav one peopl alway get high I think told didnt know go I alway tire thing I use kinda hard anymor I drive stamina energi follow the medicin I addit insulin birth control pill doc decid I stop I got pregnant monthconsid I polycysticovariansyndrom paid first two kid I guess bless I anoth babi turn 2 I mirena kind iud My hair also brittl comb matter much I treatment over last month I start balanc problem addit short breath what would happen I get I would almost blackout effect I would call like I disori I hold roller coaster feel come vertigo last 3040 second I catch I dont fall thi start happen frequent I bend wash face get back bend brush teeth even close eye I sway place it like shut electr breaker cut back quickli like glitch system caus temporari loss power resum left I also get dot flash light happen honestli bad feel constant rock sway motion I went doc pap smear week ago I told go like noooooo normal they refer cleveland clinic florida I island medic facil resourc arent best when I went I neurolog consult cardiolog consult they brain mri test one show pressur ear abnorm doctor told therapi train brain deal swayingat I ask I live hi respons basic ye I like I live life I understand concept develop diseas treat I know caus diabet pancrea stop work but tell I need accept live unaccept still dont know caus I went intern patient depart schedul appoint etc bust cri request second opinion He gave 125mg day hydroclorothiazid day although help sway medicin make short breath littl harder deal I take breath caus area around heart bone includ hurt I tri take medicin everi day capsul honestli I dont think help effect intern patient sent enthroat doctor recommend balanc test etc includ tilt tabl test everyon seem miss someth I feel symptom I tie togeth It 5 year I deal take seriou toll As stand symptom rock sway blurri vision one day I see clearli other blurri lack energi stamina short breath sharp pain draw deep breath decreas libido hair breakag black actual black I usual minti feel within head somewhat tingli medic I novolg insulin pump 45 unit per day includ basal bolu dose roaccutan 20mg day clear acn final I last 7month side effect dri lip mirena insert 2009 5 year durat hydrochlorothiazid 125 mg everi day I finish roaccutan treatment first time sinc I 14 skin clear confirm diagnosi diabetictyp 1 polycysticovarian syndrom result cleveland clinic test mri brain iac without gadolinium their impress 1 No enhanc lesion post gadolinium 2 mildli promin cisterna magna slight asymmetri later ventric 3 non specif ubo white matter largest 45mm medial left tempor lobe thi could repres demyelin vascul migrain normal varient ischem chang 4 No evid mass enhanc lesion involv iac either side 5 left maxillari sinus hypertrophi turbin auditori brainstem respons abr electrocochleographi ecog their impress 1 today result consist normal transmiss time lower auditori system ear electrophysiolog evid viii nerv pontin level auditori pathway lesion 2 ecog examin abnorm ear present electropsysiolog evid increas labyrinthin pressur both ear test recommend schedul middl septemb 1 audiogram eng 2 tilt tabl test I know long windedbut helpinput would greatli appreci ani recommend test type doctor go anyon experienc type thing anyon know anyon experienc type thingjust help pleas

385,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Not sure where to post this; but here goes. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis/proctitis at age 13; but I'm certain now it's been UC all along. For 12 yrs they tried all kinds of things - cortizone enemas & prednisone; etc - but nothing helped. Finally referred to a gastroenterologist in 1980 who said there were some ""new studies"" that indicated that colitis might be caused by an imbalance in the bacterial environment of the intestine. From the little I've read here so far; that seems to have held true. It also held true for me. My Dr suggested that I add Metamucil to my diet 3 times a day and for the 1st time in 12 yrs the bleeding stopped. I discovered flare ups came after eating pork - I've since decided it's the preservatives in pork (and lunchmeats) that I react to. By avoiding those foods; and using Metamucil for the odd flare-up; I've managed to keep my illness in check for 30 yrs. Until now . . . About a month ago I flared up. This is the 1st time Metamucil hasn't worked. AMs are worst but I'm sometimes up in the night; too. The frequency is much more than ever before; and I've actually had a couple of major accidents when I couldn't get to the washroom in time. The Metamucil has helped some - for the most part once the AM has passed; I manage most of the rest of the day without having to run to the washroom at a moment's notice. But I'm alarmed that Metamucil is not helping the way it always has before. I should mention that I am currently living where I have no health benefits. It's not that I couldn't see a Dr; but we'd have to pay cash and we really don't have the $$. And Drs here are very keen on surgery for this type of illness - I know of a half dozen people who've had the surgery - my daughter's 15 yr old bf among them; and his Dr refused to even consider alternatives. So I'm reluctant to subject myself to Drs. I was encouraged to read that the use of probiotics and such still seems to be used. I guess I'm looking for some suggestions for additional options to help me get this under control again.

389,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I am a 54 yr old female from Australia. I have had 2 blood tests(Liver Function) several weeks apart which showed mildly elevated ALP - 126 and 132; and also my platelet levels were not right (I did not get the reading). I requested the clotting tests because I was bruising easily on my hands and arms; small purple bruises from simple bumps. I have had a dull ache in the right upper side of my abdomen; just beneath and also under the rib; also some muscle? pain in the back in that area (I put it down to muscular as it usually appears after physical work). This has happened occasionally over some 20 years; and which I have described as an echo of gall bladder pain (I had mine removed in 1980). Sometimes it feels like a cross between that pain and ulcer pain. 3 nights ago I had a severe bout of pain which lasted several hours. I have had duodenal ulcers in the past as well as reflux; and I have been taking famotidine 40mg daily for many years. I have been on medication for hypertension for 2 years now; and recently had the dosage raised - telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. I have been taking piperazine oestrone sulphate(oestrogen) 2.5 mg for 4 years (for hot flushes) and fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg for many years (for Excema and itchy skin). I am presently 85 kg in weight; having recently lost 8 kg. I used to walk for at least 30 minutes of a morning; but after a prolonged period of suspected bursitis was diagnosed with a torn gluteal tendon which requires surgery to fix. I have been taking 2 Vioxx (rofecoxib 12.5 mg)anti inflammatories daily for 14 months. My lifestyle is really busy; we run a small business and are active in many industry associations; also travel frequently; hence my reluctance to have surgery which will require complete rest for several months. I feel like I am falling apart physically. Consequently on a recent trip to the USA I purchased some Tylenol PM to help me sleep at night (it hurts to lie on my leg); and have been taking 2 every night for 6 weeks. My GP sent me for a CT abdomen scan this morning; but I am unable to swallow the mixture; so I did not have the scan. I have difficulty swallowing even cough mixture. I do also have haemorrhoids which bleed a little; and sometimes pass mucous; but eat unprocessed bran every morning with porridge to stay regular. My questions are - do you think I could have the pain and elevated tests because of the drugs I have been taking; especially the Tylenol? Could the elevated ALP readings be from lack of sleep(I read that somewhere)? Would those symptoms on their own be any indication of liver or other GI problems? Is the bruising a symptom of any GI problem or possibly an age thing? I would have thought I was not old enough. Is it possible to have investigative tests without having to swallow mixtures? - I have avoided suggested colonoscopies and barium enemas at various times over the past few years; I seriously cannot swallow the mixture,2003,2003,54.0,Female,,,hello I 54 yr old femal australia I 2 blood testsliv function sever week apart show mildli elev alp 126 132 also platelet level right I get read I request clot test I bruis easili hand arm small purpl bruis simpl bump I dull ach right upper side abdomen beneath also rib also muscl pain back area I put muscular usual appear physic work thi happen occasion 20 year I describ echo gall bladder pain I mine remov 1980 sometim feel like cross pain ulcer pain 3 night ago I sever bout pain last sever hour I duoden ulcer past well reflux I take famotidin 40mg daili mani year I medic hypertens 2 year recent dosag rais telmisartan 80 mg plu hydrochlorothiazid 125 mg I take piperazin oestron sulphateoestrogen 25 mg 4 year hot flush fexofenadin hydrochlorid 180 mg mani year excema itchi skin I present 85 kg weight recent lost 8 kg I use walk least 30 minut morn prolong period suspect bursiti diagnos torn gluteal tendon requir surgeri fix I take 2 vioxx rofecoxib 125 mganti inflammatori daili 14 month My lifestyl realli busi run small busi activ mani industri associ also travel frequent henc reluct surgeri requir complet rest sever month I feel like I fall apart physic consequ recent trip usa I purchas tylenol PM help sleep night hurt lie leg take 2 everi night 6 week My GP sent CT abdomen scan morn I unabl swallow mixtur I scan I difficulti swallow even cough mixtur I also haemorrhoid bleed littl sometim pass mucou eat unprocess bran everi morn porridg stay regular My question think I could pain elev test drug I take especi tylenol could elev alp read lack sleepi read somewher would symptom indic liver GI problem Is bruis symptom GI problem possibl age thing I would thought I old enough Is possibl investig test without swallow mixtur I avoid suggest colonoscopi barium enema variou time past year I serious swallow mixtur

391,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have muscle spasm in or around the ribs on both sides (in the front under the breast and sometimes in the back at the same horizontal position); it feels like a ball rolling; in that it switches sides. It occurs even at night during sleep; painful enough to wake me. I only know that when I relax and stretch (the side where the knot is) using several positions I have to wait till it goes away; in many cases to have it return in other places described above. What does it mean; how do I treat it. I have high blood pressure and the meds deplete my potassium so I take a prescription supplement for that.

393,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was really hoping for a suggestion as to why I may have developed an indentation in the top of my head. At first I thought I was crazy; and that it was impossible for that to happen; but over the last few months it seems to have grown and now anyone who feels the top of my head can easily feel it. It scares me; especially since my husband had brain surgery less than 2 years ago- (symptoms completely different of course) I am 35 years old; the only time I remember hitting my head really hard is when I was in elementary school and I fell and hit my head on a tile floor. I have had a history of passing out and having seizures but the doctors never figured out for sure what caused it and it hasn't happened for a few years. The best they came up with was blood sugar; and dehydration as a cause for those episodes; although I never had a MRI or anything of my head. I don't get pains from it; it may be a little tender if I press on the indent kind of hard.

397,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks in advance for your answer. History: 53;non smoker;no drugs non drinker. About 2 months ago became aware of increased amount of PACs and PVCs. Had them since childhood but only a few to non a day. Holter and other tests led cardio to diagnos as benign. Had less than 1000 PACs per day and less than 50 PVCs. They started to increase from 1-2 an hour and within a week to the present 1 every minute which was my reason to seek medical attention. The doc started me on a low dose of atenolol due to moderate hypertension and the palps. 25mg a day but it knocked my heart rate to 42-50 and pressure at peak to 85/55. The dose was reduced to half of a 25mg x 3 times a day which kept the pressure at a more constant 115/75 or there abouts. The palpitations also are milder but not much less in number. Question #1: I have been on the atenolol now for 4 weeks and now there is trace blood in the urine as well as hematospermia. Urologist thinks its not due to the atenolol but to a prostatitis and is giving me Levaquin 500mg once a day for it. Have been on it one week but the hematospermia persists and the urine test still shows trace of blood. Can the blood in urine be from the blood from the hematospermia. I know that your not a urologist but could still tie things together. Question #2: I've read posts that indicate that having these PAC's and PVC's will someday lead to a-fib of varying seriousness. Is this true and is it always the case or rarely? It seems as if one thing after another. Always been healthy now 4 things in a row. Are they tied together.

399,Atenolol+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40.0,Female,,,40yearold ladi I diagnos hypertens 200100 sinc 2005 I take atenolol 25 mg nightli 2 year In 2007 I deliv babi boy age 37 sinc I rapid weight gain short breath I walk step climb stair I feel uneasi breath I exert after rest goe I continu atenolol 25 mg I underw echo 2008 normal I also underw lipid profil ldl triglycerid high sinc BP control atenolol cardiologist suggest take carvedilol 625 mg after 2 year I underw master health checkup I underw echo treadmil test chest xray blood urin test again reveal BP high ldl triglycerid high cardiologist precrib month carvedilol anticholesterol medic even take drug I uneasi chest I exert He suggest undergo angiogram then I check anoth cardiologist chang carvedilol amlodipin BP then chang combin atenolol amlodipin BP fine but I still uneasi chest I exert BP control sometim goe 150100 My thyroid function normal My diabet test normal My triglycerid ldl still reduc I take atorvastatin lipid last 6 month I sever daytim somnol I work medic transcriptionist My job stress job I depress took antidepress 3 month last year after take I irregular cycl weight gain I stop My daytim sleepi sever I abl concentr work I abl peac sleep when I sleep night I feel awak whole night race thought I feel rest I get I heavi snore I underw pulmonari function test normal I took chest xray doctor felt I might cardiomegali I underw eye exam vision perfectli normal except dri eye I use artifici tear I extern hemorrhoid kindli suggest test done daytim somnol rapid weight gain I check almost specialti I confus reason would
400,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 53-year old female who is not overweight. My blood pressure has always been good; usually 112-120 over 66-72. Two months ago; I suffered a severe headache that literally dropped me to my knees. I was outside talking to a neighbor; bent down and straightened up and my head started hurting; in the area a baseball cap would fit; and wouldn't quit. My husband and neighbor had to carry me into the house. I was taken to the hospital; my blood pressure was quite high (due to the pain; I'm guessing). They did a CT and found nothing. Two weeks later; my head started to hurt; I checked my blood pressure (I'm a nurse and was at work); my BP was 179/119. I went to Urgent Care; but was sent to ER instead; where they did an MRI/MRA of my brain. My blood pressure was 204/120. They gave me Atenolol; and after my BP came back down into the safe range they released me. The results of my MRI came back normal; but my MRA was abnormal. Apparently I am missing the A1 segment on the right; however; I am still getting sufficient blood flow to the brain. The ER doctor called me and said it is probably something I was born with; and doubts it presents a problem; but still wants me to see a neurologist (which I am doing end of the month). My blood pressure is still high; I check it three times a day and yesterday it was 165/102; 159/102 and 154/85. The day before that: 153/90; 124/84;157/94. This morning I took it after I got up; and before coffee; it was 143/100. I should mention that I have been taking Atenolol 50mg q.d. Prior to that the ER had me taking Clonidine twice a day; but only gave me a two prescription. My BP still ran high. I'm just wondering if high cholesterol could be the cause? or part of it? I have no idea what it is currently; but two years ago it ok. My PCP hasn't suggested having it checked; but am wondering if that might not be a good idea? I am not taking any medications; either prescribed or over the counter; except the Atenolol. I am somewhat concerned; especially since this seems to have come on so suddenly. I would appreciate any thoughts you might have. And when is a BP reading considered to be in the danger zone??

I was first diagnosed when I was about 8 when my doctor saw on a visit that my blood pressure was within stroke range. I had been on atenolol (50mg) for years until I hit some hard times and could not pay. I went back onto atenalol last year in october because of constant pressure on my chest and a particular episode where I had sudden chest pain; felt like someone sitting on my chest and numbness in arms/feeling like ice in veins. I was stupid and didn't go to the hospital right away but I was smart enough to go to a clinic and get me my medicine again. I have been taking my medicine and I have lowered my sodium intake as well as attempting to lose weight. I have PCOS which causes insulin resistance making it very hard to lose weight but with my metformin it's been slowly going down. Yesterday at work I suddenly developed a new kind of palpitation. It felt like a flutter at first and then like banging from inside my chest. The beats were irregular with no pattern and very fast. I felt disorented and dizzy and went to the break room. Several other coworkers tried to help me as I was unsure as if I should go to the hospital. One could clearly feel my pulse just by placing her hand on my shoulder. I could feel the blood surging from my chest above my right brest up into the side of my neck feeling almost frothy. I was shaking and even now most of what happened seems foggy. It calmed down after ten minutes and after taking it easy sitting down to work my head cleared. Even still I feel a bruised achy feeling in my chest almost like a cold feeling. I can't sleep because I can feel my pulse and the ache in my chest. It's not sharp or getting worse but just feels like the after affects of someone hitting me. Could this be something new or is my hypertension needing addressed further? What could this event have been?,2010,2010,23.0,Female,,,hello I 23 year old femal long histori hypertens I first diagnos I 8 doctor saw visit blood pressur within stroke rang I atenolol 50mg year I hit hard time could pay I went back onto atenalol last year octob constant pressur chest particular episod I sudden chest pain felt like someon sit chest numb armsfeel like ice vein I stupid didnt go hospit right away I smart enough go clinic get medicin I take medicin I lower sodium intak well attempt lose weight I pco caus insulin resist make hard lose weight metformin slowli go yesterday work I suddenli develop new kind palpit It felt like flutter first like bang insid chest the beat irregular pattern fast I felt disor dizzi went break room sever cowork tri help I unsur I go hospit one could clearli feel puls place hand shoulder I could feel blood surg chest right brest side neck feel almost frothi I shake even happen seem foggi It calm ten minut take easi sit work head clear even still I feel bruis achi feel chest almost like cold feel I cant sleep I feel puls ach chest it sharp get wors feel like affect someon hit could someth new hypertens need address what could event
402,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I've been taking Lisinopril 40mg; and crazy dizziness and headaches occurred and brought my blood pressure down to around 90/50; so my doctor had me take only 20mg lisinopril per day. With 20mg; my blood pressure was constantly at 160-170/100. Then; the doctor told me to take Atenolol 25mg at night and lisinopril 20mg in the morning. It brought my blood pressure down to around 100/60 regularly; but recently it started going up again. I often have electric tingling/weakness in my hands/arms/legs and feel like I will faint. Blood pressure fluctuates from 160/100 to 100/60 from one day to another. Doctor thinks I have panic attack and should take Xanax for it. But; I feel like the medication combination (atenolol/lisinopril) is giving me hard time. I asked doctor to please change the medication but he refuses; and he thinks it's the anxiety attack that's the cause for all this. What should I do? Is Lisinopril/Atenolol a proven combination to help hypertension? Thanks.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,,,Hi ive take lisinopril 40mg crazi dizzi headach occur brought blood pressur around 9050 doctor take 20mg lisinopril per day with 20mg blood pressur constantli 160170100 then doctor told take atenolol 25mg night lisinopril 20mg morn It brought blood pressur around 10060 regularli recent start go I often electr tinglingweak handsarmsleg feel like I faint blood pressur fluctuat 160100 10060 one day anoth doctor think I panic attack take xanax but I feel like medic combin atenolollisinopril give hard time I ask doctor pleas chang medic refus think anxieti attack that caus what I Is lisinoprilatenolol proven combin help hypertens thank

406,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 74 yr old female; very active; moderate weight. I've been treated for hypertension for over 10 years; trying various meds with limited success. Have been on Atenolol 100 mg; Hydroclorothiazide 25 mg; Losartian100 mg and Amlodopine 5 mg for several years now. Over the past 4 years I have had episodes of feeling unwell for an hour or so and eventually fainting. After a full workup I was told that no cause was found other than perhaps I become dehydrated causing my BP to drop to very low levels i.e. Labile Hypertension. My BP seems to normally run around 135 to 145 / 78 to 85. Checking it when I am starting to get the 'unwell' feeling I find it has dropped to 103/71. I realize that this is a 'good' reading but I definitely don't feel well when it is this low. Yesterday it was in the low range all day but went back to 'normal' at bed time. This AM it is back down to 103/71 again with the associated nauseated sick feeling.

407,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor and has suggested a short term disability (90 days) from work to determine if stress is actually the root cause and to see if being away will lower the pressure. As well; although no kidney problems have been shown; he is also referring me to a kidney specialist for an additionial consultation to determine if he can see anything else that may be causing this issue. At this time; I feel I am getting excellent care; however; I am very concerned that these elevated levels will trigger a stroke. I would appreciate your comments on any other plausible medicial condition which you may feel might be the cause and your feedback on the short term disability aspect.,2008,2008,50.0,Male,,,I 50 year old male juli ide secondari hypertnes 230130i herid hypertens issu sinc I 23 manag normal level singl dose 50 mg beta blocker tenormin atenolol sinc juli I place follow medic norvasc 10mg dailyrampiril 20 mg dailyatacand 16mg daili tiazac 360mg daili tterazosin 6mg daili spironliacton 25 mg daili well 81mg aspirin although I cholesterol problem I take crestor 10 mgi ekg echo cardiogram indaict blockag although small valv problem consid root caus BP issuei also doppler imag kidney confirm renal arteri issu substanti blood work confirm adren gland issuesalso wear 24 BP monitor three time confirm BP high throughout 24 hour period present medic BP remain 190120mi specialist indic feel stress contrbut factor suggest short term disabl 90 day work determin stress actual root caus see away lower pressur As well although kidney problem shown also refer kidney specialist additioni consult determin see anyth els may caus issu At time I feel I get excel care howev I concern elev level trigger stroke I would appreci comment plausibl medici condit may feel might caus feedback short term disabl aspect
408,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 34 yr old woman. I have 2 children. I am 5'6"" and weigh 135 lbs. (so; within normal limits) I have a history of smoking. I quit 7 months ago. I had pregnancy induced hypertension at the end of my first pregnancy which resolved at the birth of my child. I also had hypertension immediately following the birth of my 2nd child that resolved in a couple of weeks. A few months ago I had two episodes of hypertension while at work 177/112 and 160/100. I was working a night shift both times and had drank an energy drink. Both episodes the elevated BP was accompanied by a headache and lasted several hours. I visited my Dr. following these episodes and she thought it was the energy drink causing the high BP. Since then I quit drinking energy drinks and even quit drinking caffeine regularly. ( I now have no more than one caffeinated beverage a week). Since then I have checked my blood pressure periodically and it is usually around 120/78. Two nights ago I was walking around the house and felt my heart skipping around. I have felt palpitations before; but they always went away right away. I continued to feel these palpitations so went in to the ER. EKG showed Premature Junctional Contractions. Dr. stated that these were harmless. Blood work all came back negative. But; BP was elevated between 150/100; 165/121; and 180/111. I was given Toprol 25mg; which I have taken daily since. My blood pressure has normalized; but the heart palpitations continue now more than 36 hrs later.

412,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a delimma and am hoping someone could help me on this. I had a severe case of SVT in Feb'08 and was prescribed Atenolol 25 mg each day. I was taking Atenolol when I realised I was pregnant; the 1s day of my last period was 2nd March'08. I stopped taking Atenolol on 4th April. My doctor is advising me to go for a termination of pregnancy as this medicine could have serious effects on the foetus. But I don't want to do that as I feel the actual exposure to foetus is really very small to worry about. Any advise is appreciated.

414,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi I've been on beta blockers for the last 10 years primarily for hypertension initially caused by anxiety. Up until 12 months ago I was on Propranolol 80 mg daily this was then changed to Atenolol 25 mg daily with a view to stopping using. Basically my anxiety returned and I bottled out of stopping them. However fast fwd a year and I have been experiencing ectopic heart beats quite often when exercising so being worried about these back to the docs I went. I under went a 24 hour ecg and results showed the ectopic beats and Bradycardia down to 36bpm at times. As such I have been told I need to come off the Atenolol which I have been doing for the last 5days by chopping tablets in half which I have been told to do for the next two weeks then stop. I was just wondering what I should be feeling heart rate wise as the pills wear off I already seem t have a much more reactive heart rate to exercise even something as simple as climbing stairs increases the heart rate. I am quite fit and regularly cycle and walk for an hour each per day. It is just ever since my anxiety episodes even though ten years ago as soon as I feel my heart rate I go into panic mode.,2007,2008,,,,,Hi ive beta blocker last 10 year primarili hypertens initi caus anxieti Up 12 month ago I propranolol 80 mg daili chang atenolol 25 mg daili view stop use basic anxieti return I bottl stop howev fast fwd year I experienc ectop heart beat quit often exercis worri back doc I went I went 24 hour ecg result show ectop beat bradycardia 36bpm time As I told I need come atenolol I last 5day chop tablet half I told next two week stop I wonder I feel heart rate wise pill wear I alreadi seem much reactiv heart rate exercis even someth simpl climb stair increas heart rate I quit fit regularli cycl walk hour per day It ever sinc anxieti episod even though ten year ago soon I feel heart rate I go panic mode
415,Atenolol+hypertension,A year ago at the age of 44 I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and prescribed 25mg Atenolol daily. I was 40-50lbs overweight and in the past year have returned to competetive cycling to help weight management. I'm now riding 40 - 50 mile training rides and about 100 miles weekly but find I've got to a level where no amount of extra training improves my performance; particularly on hills. Cyclists of the same age are often faster. Similarly when using a heart rate monitor I can't seem to get my heart rate above 140bpm whatever I do; whether in the gym or on the bike. I assume this is an effect of the drug. Also I don't get out of breath when training as much as I used to. Does this mean the drug prevents me from working anywhere near my anaerobic threshold? Will no amount of training alow me to improve so long as I keep taking Atenolol? As my level of fitness is greatly improved compared to when I began taking the Atenolol and my weight reduced (by over 30lbs) and bearing in mind the low 25mg daily dose is it logical that if I stopped the medication the higher intensity training I might undertake would benefit my condition?,2003,2003,44.0,,,,A year ago age 44 I diagnos high blood pressur prescrib 25mg atenolol daili I 4050lb overweight past year return competet cycl help weight manag Im ride 40 50 mile train ride 100 mile weekli find ive got level amount extra train improv perform particularli hill cyclist age often faster similarli use heart rate monitor I cant seem get heart rate 140bpm whatev I whether gym bike I assum effect drug also I dont get breath train much I use doe mean drug prevent work anywher near anaerob threshold will amount train alow improv long I keep take atenolol As level fit greatli improv compar I began take atenolol weight reduc 30lb bear mind low 25mg daili dose logic I stop medic higher intens train I might undertak would benefit condit
416,Atenolol+hypertension,"Two quick questions: is there a difference between high blood pressure and hypertension (I noticed there are 2 different topics listed here) Also; I began taking 12.5mg of atenolol 2x/day - it's only my second day; so in total I took 3 pills. I noticed a feeling of calm come over me; however; I was told it might make me sleepy. I had the opposite reaction. As soon as I took it; I developed a metallic taste in my mouth; my arms started to hurt (second dose it was okay); but I feel like I have dry mouth (not totally but it almost feels like a swollen tongue). I drank some more but it doesn't really help. The odd thing was that it immediately curbed my appetite. The first day I ate nothing after I took the pill and only started feeling hungry when it was wearing off in time for the night pill. I felt spacey all day from not eating (like low blood sugar) but I had no appetite whatsoever. When I took the night pill; I was up the whole night. It's almost like a shot of adrenaline. It is worrying me. I took my morning pill and the same thing happen. My appetite was gone in no time; and when I had to drive in the afternoon to get my daughter from school; I was so spaced it out it was scary. I thought maybe my pressure dropped. The first day the reading shot up to 1 79/112 (I'm usally 150's/100's); and then stayed high most of the day; but today it seemed to have dropped to mid 120's or so. I went out tonight and didnt' take the pill; and yet i was still soaring with adrenaline (I still can't sleep and it 's 4am); the metallic taste is there and that swelling of the tongue. so bizarre. my daughter was like ""mom; go to bed; how are you still awake and hyper."" My bp was 179/100's - not good - probably because i missed tonight's dosage. But I'm scared to take it again. I took a xanax .25mg to try and sleep. Any help would be appreciated. I'm seeing my dr on monday.. This is the first bp med that worked a bit for me; as the calcium channel blockers (norvasc and plendil which caused vomiting) gave me suicidal (that's what they called them) cluster headaches and elevated my bp to 250/135. I'm scared that if i missed the night dose i might have a stroke (i read that on one of the boards if u suddenly stop taking bp meds you could have a stroke). I have a blockage in my renal artery (one dr said it is thick on one side but clear on the other; also the renal doppler showed a bruit ad significant restriction of blood flow; the MRI showed it as well.....but not conclusively. I'm getting very frustrated with it all. I've tried natural remedies; lsost weight and yet nothing. So atenolol is my last resort.

The dosage was reduced to 12.5 mg and since my BP has been normal (120/70). However; I still have periods of low HR (40-45). I am a runnner (although not much in the past 10 months); but do not know what my resting HR was prior to starting Atenolol. The side effect in the first few days were fatigue; etc. However; in the past week or so; I've had ringing in my ears and a ""jittery"" feeling that seems to be getting worse. This prevents me from sleeping at times and when I am able to sleep; wake up during the night with these feelings. I take the medication just before I go to sleep. My doctor thinks these symptoms could be caused by anxiety and has perscribed Lexapro. He has suggested I take this for a week and then switch my BP medicine to Lisinopril due to the Bradycardia.

420,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi! Anybody know how high is ""too high"" of a heartrate when on 100 mg atenolol a day? I am on the atenolol for borderline hypertension and mostly because of benign palpitations. Have had all the tests over the years...palps diagnosed as stress related. I dont get much exercise...but I do take 6 flights of stairs DOWN every day at work. ( no..I havent mastered going UP yet!) I am very overweight; have been for several years now; so trying to take it slow. Am 46 years old. My normal pulse at rest is between 58-65. I take my pulse when I get to my car after taking the stairs down; and usually it doesnt jump much---is around 95-100 immediatly after the stairs. It goes down to a normal rate really quick--usually within a few minutes... (1-4). THe past couple days Ive taken the stairs down; and feel quite winded--and pulse was 113 on Friday.

427,Atenolol+hypertension,"O.K. I had been debating whether to post my question here because I feel that is is very complex; or at least the lead up to it is. To make a very long story as short as I can; I was very healthy up until I was 22 years old. I am now 24 years old. When I was 21 my father was killed by a drunk driver and this sent me into a depression; although I never went to a doctor or took any medication for it. When I was 22 I graduated from college and took a full-time job as an operations manager; working days and nights alike; at least 70 hours per week. In January of 2007; one month before my 24th birthday; I experienced what I can only describe as a panick attack. I was riding in the passenger seat with my boss; when all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint. I then felt my hands and feet get numb and felt a big pressure in my chest. I asked him to please drive me to the hospital cuz I felt something was really wrong with me. When I arrived at the hospital; I got even more scared and began to have trouble breathing. They brought out the EKG machine to the waiting room and said all was normal. The doctor said that all the blood work and EKG were fine; but that he wanted to keep me over night for tests. Over night; I received three more EKG's; chest X-Ray's; a CT-scan (where they inject a yellow colored iodine to map your arteries); and the whole time I was hooked up to a little box that was monitoring my heart for the entire 24 hours. In less than 18 hours they cleared me to go home with no restrictions. Over the next two weeks of out-patient visits; my Internal medicine doctor noticed that my blood pressure was consistently high; with an average of 145-150/90-95. He put me on Atenolol 25-mg and on Xanax as needed for the anxiety; that he diagnosed as GAD. Well; my blood pressure improved to an average of about 130/80-85 or so; which he felt was satisfactory so he asked to not see me for another 3-4 months. However; during this time I experience another 2 ""panick attacks"" with similar symptoms to the ones mentioned above. Needless to say; I went for a second opinion with a Family Practitioner; whom assured me that my heart was fine based on the hospital results; but he added a 10-mg dose of Enalapril to go with the 25-mg of Atenolol because his goal was to get my blood pressure to an a systolic reading less than 120 and a diastolic reading of less than 80 on a consistent basis. He also took me off of Xanax and put me on Lexapro 10-mg. In addition; he asked me to exercise more and lose some weight. I did everything he told me and the results were great. My blood pressure now is an average of maximum 120 systolic over 78 diastolic. I run 2.5 miles at least 3-4 times per week; and although my diet isn't the best; I greatly cut back on my consumption of sodium; saturated fat; and caffeine. Now; today I went in to another doctor in my hometown b/c I had strep throat and he was schocked to see that a 24-year old man is on Atenolol. He said that I should immidiatly go see a cardiologist; b/c he suspects that I am on Atenolol b/c there is something wrong with my heart. This scared me more than I can explain. Neither of my parents have any history of heart disease; heart attack; or stroke. Neither do my grandparents. My mom has hypertension as does my maternal grandmother. When my dad passed away at the age of 59 his only ailment was high cholesterol. My question is this: 1.) Was his assumption that there is probably something wrong with my heart accurate; because I am on atenolol? 2.) What kind of a future do I have to look forward to as a 24-yeard old man with hypertension? I know my message is very long but any help you could provide me would be greatly appreciated.

429,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather ""sloppy"" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms?

I have been prescribed atenolol to relieve my symptoms and my blood pressure has come down some. Less than six months ago; I monitored my blood pressure daily and I always had normal readings.

432,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was put on hctz 12.5 mg around 2006; but knowing I have severe ""white coat syndrome""; I never took it until I tore some muscles in my upper back and the Dr. insisted I start the med. in May of 07. I have a B/P monitor which checks out against the ones at the Dr.s office; so I was pretty sure my home readings were accurate and they were OK. I was in a great deal of pain from my back injury and PT was making it worse. My personal trainer suggested a med that had helped with a back problem; and my physician sent in a perscription for it. After one dose; I ended up in the ER in the middle of the night with outrageously high B/P. They got that fixed; but it went way up again the next day and I saw another MD who immediately put me on 12.5 mg Atenolol. That was in July of 07. I am 5'2"" tall; weigh 116# and have no cholesterol problems or any other (known) medical problems that simple blood tests would uncover. While on Atenolol I got very out of breath on my daily walks and ; being a SCUBA diver; I had a very scary out of breath episode under water that made me decide to try to get off the Beta blocker. My current MD had me take my regular dose every other day for a week and then stop. The first week after stopping; my energy level was off the charts; but this past week there has been a lot of heart-pounding; rapid heartbeats; soaring B/P from time to time; a rushing sound in my ears that makes me think my B/P is way up and my fears just make it much worse. She said I might have to double up on the hctz if there was a Beta blocker backlash; but I really want to stop those; too. Is there any hope for that and is there anything I can do to help myself through this? I don't smoke; I seldom drink and never more than 1 glass of red wine or 1-2 beers. I exercise regularly; and have cut salt out of my life as much as possible and take vitamins regularly along with cutting out red meat. There is a strong family history of heart problems which none of my Dr's seem to address - most don't even get up from the computer to listen to my heart.

441,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it.

442,Atenolol+hypertension,I am taking 25 mg of atenolol at night for hypertension along with .2mg of clonidine. I just started taking the atenolol two months ago and it knocks me out. The Dr just increased it to 50mg. I took it and my husband had the hardest time waking me up. When I finally did come around I felt disconnected.

444,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I have been having rapid heart beat and 12;000 PVCs a day for the past 2 years; since giving birth to my daughter. My question is whether or not I should take 25 mg of Atenolol twice a day. My primary care doc says I need to take it; but I've been told by a cardiac doc that my PVCs are benign. So; is taking the beta-blocker just to make me feel better? Or will it actually benefit my body somehow? I have taken it before; and it does help lower my heart rate and frequency of PVCs. Thanks!,2009,2009,33.0,Female,,,hello I rapid heart beat 12000 pvc day past 2 year sinc give birth daughter My question whether I take 25 mg atenolol twice day My primari care doc say I need take ive told cardiac doc pvc benign So take betablock make feel better Or actual benefit bodi somehow I taken help lower heart rate frequenc pvc thank

446,Atenolol+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system? I don't eat red meat or pork and I eat lots of veggies so other than diet; are there alternatives that could help me reduce my BP that I may not be aware of (other than exercise; which I do 7-days a week) and a low sodium diet?,2011,2011,42.0,Female,,,My heart feel like race time didnt happen prior start atenolol 5year ago I 100mg per day I took 12pill 5day 14pill 5day noth ive 7day My Dr said dont prescrib atenolol activ peopl got start amlodipin 10mg I allerg I also stop everyth 7day I take drug 14atenolol pill day My blood pressur rang around 14592 w bpm 85 rest Im everyth realli wasnt much lower take atenolol number lower I would realli like med free especi heart race way chest feel like heart readi protrud could atenolol use year caus happen subsid eventu how long take atenolol complet leav system I dont eat red meat pork I eat lot veggi diet altern could help reduc BP I may awar exercis I 7day week low sodium diet
447,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 32 years old male. I have high blood pressure for last 10 years and I am taking Atenlol 50mg for last 6 years. I started running marathons in 2008 and since then I have completed 4 marathons with an average time of 3:40:00. I consulted my doctor and he said its good idea for my health to keep this routine; although Atenlol might be a hindrance in exercise. Personally; I feel quite relaxed after each training run and even marathons. During exercise session my heart rate is always less than 150 bpm while its 40-45 bpm at rest state. I didn't had this problem earlier but now-a-days I feel quite over-breathed in first 30 minutes of the run but it stabilizes after that. I also have the tendency to gain weight very easily. My question here is: - Is it a good idea to run marathons with my disease and prescribed medication? - If yes; then why do I feel over-breathed recently and why do I gain the weight within a week time if I stop exercising ? - I also want to increase my marathon time; but it seems the pace of 5 mins/km is the limit for me. Does Atenlol is really limiting my speed.

448,Atenolol+hypertension,Hepatologist suggested my doctor put me on something to control Esophageal Varices; which after a test; were discovered in me. The severity is said to be medium. I've don’t some reading with contradicting beliefs from various doctors and clinical trials. However; all doctors seem to agree that a beta blocker like Atenolol is necessary for a long term use. Just want to know if any of you are on this treatment at 25mg per day. I understand there are some risks; but that the result of lowering blood pressure and heartbeats can help reduce the development of a more serious Varices problem; which in some cases can cause death form unstoppable internal bleeding.

449,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor; as I am employed in a high stress job with a major financial company and has recommended a short trem disability to determine if being away will cause the BP to go down.Although I am not adverse to this; I would apprecaite any additional plausable medical issue that may be root cause. My situation is being closely monitored and I do feel I am getting good care/treatment;however; I am concerned that this could lead to something bigger ie; a stroke if I can not get this under control. One of the issues I have also dealt with along with this is a rapid heart beat and beta blockers were increased to assist with this problem. Given the secondary hypertension and the heart beat I am somewhat concerned. Could the heart beat issue cause this BP as opposed to a stress related issue.,2008,2008,50.0,Male,,,I 50 year old male juli ide secondari hypertnes 230130i herid hypertens issu sinc I 23 manag normal level singl dose 50 mg beta blocker tenormin atenolol sinc juli I place follow medic norvasc 10mg dailyrampiril 20 mg dailyatacand 16mg daili tiazac 360mg daili tterazosin 6mg daili spironliacton 25 mg daili well 81mg aspirin although I cholesterol problem I take crestor 10 mgi ekg echo cardiogram indaict blockag although small valv problem consid root caus BP issuei also doppler imag kidney confirm renal arteri issu substanti blood work confirm adren gland issuesalso wear 24 BP monitor three time confirm BP high throughout 24 hour period present medic BP remain 190120mi specialist indic feel stress contrbut factor I employ high stress job major financi compani recommend short trem disabl determin away caus BP go downalthough I advers I would apprecait addit plausabl medic issu may root caus My situat close monitor I feel I get good caretreatmenthowev I concern could lead someth bigger ie stroke I get control one issu I also dealt along rapid heart beat beta blocker increas assist problem given secondari hypertens heart beat I somewhat concern could heart beat issu caus BP oppos stress relat issu
450,Atenolol+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

451,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. (1) Could you please quote if possible the success rate for PVC ablations at the CCF; also the complication rate for this procedure? (2) At what stage is a PVC ablation recommended or does it depends symptoms associated with frequency? (3) Any new information on why one can go for months or years without any significant amount of PVC and then they flare up at the rate of thouasnds a day for weeks to months on end before subsiding. Could some autoimmune disorder or connective inflammatory disease be a trigger? I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis and this is the pattern with my PVCs flare up; just curious; I haven't had any in over 2 and half years. (4) I take Cozaar 50mg daily and atenolol (atenolol) 100mg daily in divided doses; 25mg 4 times daily; I find it more effective in helping the palpitations that way; my internist agrees with this approach. I read an article recently; can't site the article right now of some negative studies regarding atenolol and treating high blood pressure; would this apply to its effect on palpitations also; Have you all seen the article or information on this information or study?

452,Atenolol+hypertension,Can a severe isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation result in pulmonary hypertension? When I had my first echo a year ago my PA pressures were in the 30s. Last May my mitral valve was replaced; maize procedure done and PPM implanted as a result of sinus node dysfunction. I had right heart failure after surgery that has persisted and become worse. An echo last summer showed severe regurg of TV and PA pressures of 42. Symptoms are now more severe so a stress echo was done last week. PA pressures at rest were 48 and with activity 69 and pulse ox drop to 85. A walking pulse ox went from 98 to 88. IVC and right atrium was very large. I will be having a right heart cath next week to confirm the functional data. I do understand why PA pressures would increase with MV regurg but since it was not up initially please explain to me why it would be up now with the isolated TV regurg issue. Physiologically; I just don't understand that. Would a repair of the tricuspid valve fix this problem? I have seen a surgeon but he has been reluctant to go back in; first surgery was 8 months ago. I have had reoccuring atrial flutter (cardioverted 5 times in eight months; on amiodarone) with a failed ablation attempt secondary to the nature of the tricuspid valve. So an intraoperative ablation has been proposed if they elect to repair the valve. I am young and healthy for the most part though I did have thyroid cancer with a radical neck and parathyroidectomy which complicates taking diuretics. In spite of all of this; I continue to work full time though it is becoming more difficult.,2003,2004,,,,,can sever isol tricuspid valv regurgit result pulmonari hypertens when I first echo year ago PA pressur 30 last may mitral valv replac maiz procedur done ppm implant result sinu node dysfunct I right heart failur surgeri persist becom wors An echo last summer show sever regurg TV PA pressur 42 symptom sever stress echo done last week PA pressur rest 48 activ 69 puls ox drop 85 A walk puls ox went 98 88 ivc right atrium larg I right heart cath next week confirm function data I understand PA pressur would increas MV regurg sinc initi pleas explain would isol TV regurg issu physiolog I dont understand would repair tricuspid valv fix problem I seen surgeon reluct go back first surgeri 8 month ago I reoccur atrial flutter cardiovert 5 time eight month amiodaron fail ablat attempt secondari natur tricuspid valv So intraop ablat propos elect repair valv I young healthi part though I thyroid cancer radic neck parathyroidectomi complic take diuret In spite I continu work full time though becom difficult
453,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation for as long as I can remember and take Atenolol daily. I had an ECHO last week and was surprised and confused by the results. I was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and I had mild tricuspid regurgitation along with a mild RV enlargement and mild pulmonary hypertension. The cardiologist did not seem too concerned. He said my numbers were just barely over the normal ranges. My RV dimension was 2.5 cm and my RVSP was 37mmHg. Should I be getting a second opinion? Is this high pressure due to my mitral regurgitation? I am so concerned and was so overwelhmed and feel I did not get all my answers. I would appreciate any advice or commets.

456,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have had hypertension for a while; which I've tried to control with diet and exercise (walking). Those efforts were not successful as I was unable to maintain a diet and exercise program over time. I'm quite overweight. My bp at my last doctor's visit was 160/100; and a week before; at the doctor's; it was 140/100. I have always had fairly good bp; until this past year. I'm 55. Hypertension runs in my family - now; 4 of 5 of us have it; as does my mother. My doctor declined to give me a diuretic; as I have a cystocele (a hernia of sorts in the bladder wall; which makes it bulge into the vagina; causing difficulties urinating at times) although we discussed that possibility. He chose to give me Atenolol; 25 mg. once a day instead; without a diuretic. He - and the pharmacist - assured me it's well tolerated; for the most part; a mild drug; and so on. I have been doing lots of reading on the internet; and also; of the monograph provided with the medicine. I am reading about side effects such as dizziness; shortness of breath; all kinds of awful things. I have dizziness due to vertigo (believed by my Dr. to be due to fluid in ears / virus); and wonder how I'll be able to tell whether any diziness is a side effect or the vertigo. It's all very new and confusing to me. I seek input from any doctors on this forum about how folks do using this drug; as a rule; and whether I should ask for a diuretic instead (I know you can't be that specific as you don't know me). I have no other medical issues that I know of; other than being quite overweight and having a pituitary tumor that was being reated with cabergoline. I also have cut my salt back to 2;000 mg. or less; and try to walk most days; at least a mile. I want to lose weight and increase my exercising; but read about how folks' heart rates slow down; etc. Can someone provide some info that will help me adjust to this medication and/or things to look out for?

458,Atenolol+hypertension,I run about 3 miles a day on the treadmill (usually 3 miles in 30 mins). I'm taking 25mg of Atenolol 2x a day for pvcs and mild hypertension (my blood pressure varies between 125/80-140/80 but has gone higher on occasion- I also suffer from mild MVP and occassional panic attacks) I'm 33 yrs old; 6ft; 168pds. Otherwise healthy. My question is when I finish running on the treadmill my heart rate is usually only about 90 after three miles at a reasonably fast pace. I'm not that winded; but my legs hurt. I recently started running again to hopefully reduce my blood pressure and get off the atenolol. Shouldn't my heart rate be in the 140 zone in order to get full cardio benefit? Is this the Atenolol that's affecting my exercise rate? What's the point in running if I can't get my heart rate up? I'm positive the Atenolol effects my resting rate because before I started taking it it was 60 and now it's usually around 45.Any suggestions to maximize my cardio workout while taking Atenolol? I'm too young to be letting this drug interfere with my life. I'd rather be off it. Though the doctor pescribed it mainly for the pvcs and occasional tachycardia due to the panic attacks.

460,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Ellen on August 06; 1998 at 11:57:47: Hello; I just read an earlier message about not discontinuing atenolol abruptly. I have breathing trouble and chest pain; the cause of which has yet to be diagnosed. I was put on atenolol when I complained that my heart rate seemed to go up when I would stand up (I have ""reduced cardiovagal function""). The atenolol helped that. However; the breathing problem and chest pain continue. Well; I have a new pulmonary doctor and he suggested stopping the atenolol. He said that can sometimes cause make breathing worse. Also; he has retested me to see if I have reactive airways; which now it seems I do test positive for. Now I'm taking meds for that for a few weeks to see if it helps at all. I was taking atenolol 50 mg once a day. The pulm. told me to take 1/2 pill for a few days and then stop. He told me if I start feeling bad to start taking it again. I took 1/2 pill for 3 days; then stopped. Began to feel aware of the heartbeat again. It's faster; too. I guess I was excited about the thought that I'd get rid of the atenolol (I always wondered whether I really needed it all all - I can endure a fast; pounding heart as long as I know it's not dangerous. No one ever suggested it was dangerous.) I'm thinking that without the atenolol; maybe the airways meds will have a chance to work better. But have I perhaps discontinued the atenolol too abruptly? Should I talk to my internal medicine doctor about it? Should I be monitored in any way; now that I'm not taking the atenolol? I've just moved to a new city and have a new round of doctors; with whom I am very pleased so far. I've been trying to get a diagnosis for my breathing problem for so long now; and finally I'm getting a truly fresh look; starting from scratch. So; I don't want to ruffle feathers by asking one doctor about the other doctor's instructions about the atenolol; unless I truly need to. If I do ask; how should I approach it? You can probably gather that I tend to walk on eggshells around my new doctors as my naturally assertive manner has not enamored too many of my former doctors to me!!

461,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I just read an earlier message about not discontinuing atenolol abruptly. I have breathing trouble and chest pain; the cause of which has yet to be diagnosed. I was put on atenolol when I complained that my heart rate seemed to go up when I would stand up (I have ""reduced cardiovagal function""). The atenolol helped that. However; the breathing problem and chest pain continue. Well; I have a new pulmonary doctor and he suggested stopping the atenolol. He said that can sometimes cause make breathing worse. Also; he has retested me to see if I have reactive airways; which now it seems I do test positive for. Now I'm taking meds for that for a few weeks to see if it helps at all. I was taking atenolol 50 mg once a day. The pulm. told me to take 1/2 pill for a few days and then stop. He told me if I start feeling bad to start taking it again. I took 1/2 pill for 3 days; then stopped. Began to feel aware of the heartbeat again. It's faster; too. I guess I was excited about the thought that I'd get rid of the atenolol (I always wondered whether I really needed it all all - I can endure a fast; pounding heart as long as I know it's not dangerous. No one ever suggested it was dangerous.) I'm thinking that without the atenolol; maybe the airways meds will have a chance to work better. But have I perhaps discontinued the atenolol too abruptly? Should I talk to my internal medicine doctor about it? Should I be monitored in any way; now that I'm not taking the atenolol? I've just moved to a new city and have a new round of doctors; with whom I am very pleased so far. I've been trying to get a diagnosis for my breathing problem for so long now; and finally I'm getting a truly fresh look; starting from scratch. So; I don't want to ruffle feathers by asking one doctor about the other doctor's instructions about the atenolol; unless I truly need to. If I do ask; how should I approach it? You can probably gather that I tend to walk on eggshells around my new doctors as my naturally assertive manner has not enamored too many of my former doctors to me!! But if I shouldn't let these questions slide and this is important to be following up on; I won't be doing anyone a favor by being quiet. In case it's important to know; I also take Norvasc for hypertension 10 mg/day. Thank you for any suggestions; Ellen -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Ellen; Topic Area: Heart Disease There is no exact science to stopping beta blockers (such as atenolol). Stopping them abruptly can cause ""rebound tachycardia"" that is a increase in the heart rate. For most people this rise in heart rate is not dangerous. I think that the method your doctor gave you for stopping the medication is fine. If you want to extend it you could take a quarter table for an additional 3 days.

462,Atenolol+hypertension,Hey all- 21 year old male here who stared 25mg Atenolol for high blood pressure and anxiety 4 days ago. My normal BP was 143/80...and keep in mind I had essentially perfect blood work; consume a low salt diet; and have around 8% bodyfat. My BP shouldn't be high but it still is....however I have horrible anxiety; I freak out so easily. I recently started getting panic attacks; especially during stressful school situations (trying to get in med school). The 25mg Atenolol felt amazing for the first 3 days...I was calm and BP dropped to 128/70 which I was happy with. Now I'm on day 4..and I feel more anxious than before I started and my BP was 143/80 again : ( I am going to keep taking it for a while longer; but I plan to see the doc about this.

465,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor; as I am employed in a high stress job with a major financial company and has recommended a short trem disability to determine if being away will cause the BP to go down.Although I am not adverse to this; I would apprecaite any additional plausable medical issue that may be root cause. My situation is being closely monitored and I do feel I am getting good care/treatment;however; I am concerned that this could lead to something bigger ie; a stroke if I can not get this under control.

My BP has ranged from 140/95 to 160/95. About 8 mos. ago; out of the blue; my heart rate soared to about 125 at rest for about 5 minutes. I had been experiencing some difficulty breathing and tightness in my chest after climbing stairs or a 40 - 50 minute walk. I went to my GP and my BP was 180/110. He put me on 50 mg Atenolol. I experienced heavy fatigue/exhaustion. He reduced the prescription to 25 mg. after 3 mos. my bp was 160/100. I had a subsequent experience of heart racing to about 125 at rest which lasted about 3 hrs.; with extreme anxiety/perspiration. Two weeks ago I went back to my GP for a checkup. My bp was 180/100. We discussed my contining chest tightness after walking or stair climbing. He sent me to a cardiologist. Yesterday I went for my visit. He took my vitals (180/100)ran an EKG; discussed family history and my history. He concluded that I have ""some"" coronary heart disease and probable angina. We scheduled a Thalium stress test for next week and a chloresterol screening so that he could determine the extensiveness of the problem and put me on a program for improvement. Now my questions: What is the difference between a treadmill test and a thalium treadmill stress test? What does ""some"" coronary heart disease mean? What questions do I need to be asking?

468,Atenolol+hypertension,"Because I was having some problems with ""Atenolol"" after taking it for about one year (hot flashes; difficulty with achieving and maintaining an erection; drowsines); my Doctor switched me to ""Cardura"". She explained to me that it was an Alpha-blocker but explained little else. I had been on 100mg of Atenolol. She is now easing me off of the Atenolol. I am taking 75mg for three days; 50mg for three days; and 25mg for three days; after which I will be done with the Atenolol. Today is the first day that I am on 50mg's and I have also taken my first dose of Cardura (2mg). It caused me to become short of breath; tired; made me irritable; and gave me a headache. Is this because I am taking the combination of the two drugs? Is this a reaction to the Cardura? If so; is there another Beta-blocker that might not have the side effects of Atenolol?

469,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF CARDIO MD-APS on March 26; 1999 at 18:10:27: In Reply to: atenolol question posted by Jay on March 24; 1999 at 10:42:00: Im on 50 mg. atenolol at night. Also take Nubain ( nalbuphine hydrochloride ) for sleep/headaches; and am on testosterone therapy. My blood pressure has stayed the same ( 132/84 in the morning; 150-170/86-105 in the evening ); but my heart rate ( resting ) has dropped from 84 to 60 in a month or so so I suppose it is working. Can you see any possible interactions with my meds? I asked my Doc and he says no but for some reason I dont think he was listening. Thank you. Jay Dear Jay; There are always potential drug interactions in any person on multiple medications; and it really is patient dependent since it is the individuals liver and kidney that break down and excrete the drug. There might be some concern that the testosterone therapy is causing the elevation in blood pressure (levels above 140/80 are generally unacceptable; i.e. represent hypertension.) Don't know much about Nubain (not a drug we use in cardiology very much.) It really is an individual thing; i.e. what drug combination is best and safest for you; in order for you to be safe; if the same physician is not prescribing all three medications; they each need to be aware of what other medications you are on in order to assess what is the right drug for you. Atenolol is one of those drugs that has few if any interactions and I agree it is working if you resting heart rate is 60bpm. To check yourself; go to a medical library or just ask your doctor to let you see the PDR; physician's desk reference and look up under Nubain; the section called drug interactions. Your local CVS or Rite Aid pharmacist would also be able to discuss such potential interactions with you. I hope this information is useful.

At that point it seems that I can only exercise for about 10 minutes; making me wonder if the treadmill test wasn't run long enough.

I should just not exercise as hard. My question is; shouldn't a person who has an overall cardiovascular rating of ""very good to excellent"" be able to exercise longer than 10 minutes at the lower end of her target heart rate?

He gave me a target heart rate of 120-140. The evaluation gave me a cardiovascular rating of ""very good to excellent"". I find that when I exercise I have no problems at all until I get my heart rate up to 120. At that point it seems that I can only exercise for about 10 minutes; making me wonder if the treadmill test wasn't run long enough. After about 10 minutes I have to cool down or I become short of breath and nauseated. I told my doctor about this and he said that the dose of atenolol I was taking was very small. I should just not exercise as hard. My question is; shouldn't a person who has an overall cardiovascular rating of ""very good to excellent"" be able to exercise longer than 10 minutes at the lower end of her target heart rate? Could this be an effect of the atenolol? Can I expect to see an improvement if I keep working at it?

475,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it. I also have an rx for Ativan; but the atenolol makes me pretty mellow; so I don't see using that at all. Anyone have similar profiles or conditions? Anyone know of any interractions to any of these meds with atenolol? My pharm and doc say no; but just doublechecking.

476,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation for as long as I can remember and have routine echos and take Atenolol daily. I have not had an echo in several years and been having some chest pain for the last couple months. I had an echo this week and was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and also had some mild tricuspid regurgitation. RV was mild enlarged and pressure was 37mmHg so mild pulmonary hypertension. I was overwehlmed with all this news. My cardiologist did not seem to concerned said my 2.5 cm right ventricle was slightly out of normal range and the 37mmHG was just over. Should I be concerned and get a second opinion?

478,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all! I am a 22 year old college student...200 lbs and 8% bodyfat; great shape etc. I eat a nearly flawless diet and low sodium; all that jazz. Despite this; my BP has always been around 140-150/70!!! I get extremely nervous during tests and when they check my BP. In the office my BP was 175/80..a new record! My PCP put me on 50mg atenolol..claiming that my hypertension is anxiety based since I'm such a nervous person. I HATE ATENOLOL!! I used to be a great athlete..but I can't run good at all now! Also my heart rate was 60..now it's 40!! I felt dead..so I now take only 25 mg. This still makes me feel sluggish...I feel so old at only 22. HERE IS MY THEORY! When I'm not nervous- my BP has always been great (125/70). Unfortunately; I'm nervous all the time. I also get depressed and have no idea why..it's been messing with my relationships for years. In someone like me...a beta blocker makes me feel awful and more depressed..PLUS I can't workout! Going to see a new doc...and I really think I could control my pressure with an ACE-I and then an SSRI to control my anxiety. BTW I'm going to med school next year...so I'm about to get A LOT more stressed! I appreciate the help...should I switch to ACE-I + SSRI?

480,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Phil on July 07; 1998 at 13:52:22: I currently suffer from hypertension; sleep apnea and GERD / acid reflux. I'm 40 and have suffered from GERD for almost 25 years; and I'm currently taking Prilosec & Propulsid for esophogitus & Atenolol for hypertension. Generally; I can't tell the difference between hunger and the GERD symptoms; which isn't good for my weight. I am probably 20% overweight. I use a nasal CPAP machine for the sleep apnea at night. I believe that each of these maladies work against the other - the CPAP ""blows open"" my throat at night to prevent snoring and apnea; but contributes to GERD / acid reflux. The acid reflux inflames my throat & uvula aggravating the apnea. The resulting poor sleep contributes to low energy levels; hypertension; and being overweight. I have a new doctor who is a Gastro specialist. My question is - What are my medical options for aggressive treatment of the GERD? I really believe that solving the GERD is the key to all of the other maladies. I recently had a second endoscopy w/biopsy - first was negative for Barretts syndrome and H. Pylori. After a year on Prilosec & Propulsid; there is still substantial raw inflamation where esophogus meets stomach. What are my options to aggressively attack the GERD?

Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. How does medicine help control high blood pressure? For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Doctor and Poster: What is NSAIDS?

488,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently bought a blood pressure cuff to use at home as my blood pressure varies and I have occasional panic attacks. I am on 50mg of Atenolol (1/2 morning; 1/2 evening) and .5 mg Clonazepam 2x a day. I run 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I have noticed that my heart rate is usually around 42-45 during the day and my hands are always cold; especially in cold temperatures. I assume this is due to the Atenolol; but am not crazy about this side effect. My question is this: My blood pressure is usually around 135/80 when I measure it first thing in the morning. At night when I get home from work it's usually 122/73. Is everyone's Blood pressure higher in the morning? Also somtimes my blood pressure will be higher- around 142/88. Should I be concerned? I am a 33yr old male; 6ft; 160 pounds; and in fairly good shape. I have a slight heart murmer and slight leakage of the mitral valves; but my cardiologist said nothing to be concerned about. How much does Atenolol reduce blood pressure? Shouldn't mine be lower with the Atenolol if I'm healthy? I would like to lower my dosage if possible with my doctors supervision; but am worried this may increase my blood pressure. My doctor says I am taking Atenolol for Atrial Tachacardia- usually brought on by panic attacks - and not for hypertension. Before taking the Atenolol I was told my blood pressure was relatively normal-though sometimes high due to white-coat hypertension.Neither of my parents have high blood pressure; or heart problems.

490,Atenolol+hypertension,My 63-year-old mother; in overall good health; has been having a very low pulse rate. Sometimes; it has dropped to 39! The is the second time this has happened to her in the past 4 or 5 years. The first time; it was due to blood thinner medication. This time; the doctor's are not sure. She has been taking Atenolol for the past 3 years or so; and never had a problem. Her blood pressure was always borderline-high (ie...150/80). However; along with a very low pulse rate; the bottom number of her blood pressure reading has been in the 50's! Of course I am very concerned; but her blood work and EKG came out normal. She will be having a 3-day heart monitor in the near future. Any ideas what may be causing her very low pulse rate and blood pressure. Any suggestions on what specific tests she can do to find out about any problem(s)? Thank you.

491,Atenolol+hypertension,HI! I have been on Verapamil; and gained weight from that. I was also on nadolol; but the heartbeat was still forceful. I asked to go on atenolol (10 mg in the AM and PM) since it helped my mom for the same thing. It is very noticeable and i have a hard time sleeping from this! I recently went to a health and nutrition store...as I read the good effects of Hawthorne Berry on the heart.. I took that; but not at the same time as atenolol. My heartbeat is worse then ever and sooooo strong and uncomfortable! I won't go off the heart meds until I can slowly cut down. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I should do? No insurance becasue of layoffs; so this is hard. Heart tests as of last fall (2008) were normal.

492,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 57 year old man on 25 mgs. of Atenolol daily for 'white coat' hypertension; a few PVC's now and then and a possible small 'silent' heart attack sometime in my past. With the beta blocker; I take one baby aspirin per day. Also; I have a Left Bundle-Branch Block. After an echo-cardiogram; EKG's; 2 Thallium Stress Tests; my docs have okayed me for an exercise program run by the local hospital and staffed with a trainer and RN. My resting pulse now with the Atenolol is anywhere between 48 - 60; averaging about 55-57. My BP averages about 130/75 at rest. I am exercising 5 days a week; about one hour each day on various machines...attaining pulse rates of about 90-95. A few times I have managed to get to 105-110 for just a couple of minutes; but thought this might be too fast. My question is: What is a safe upper limit for my heart rate while using a treadmill; biking; etc.; while taking the Atenolol?

497,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doctor; Five days ago I was diagnosed as having had an Interior Infarct. I am a 47 y.o. male; with a physically demanding occupation. The Doctor started me on Plavix 75mg; Lipitor 20mg and Atenolol 25mg (half a 50mg) all daily. I was previously taking Avapro + HCT to control hypertension. The Doctor advised me to continue taking the Avapro + HCT. Since being on all of these medications my pulse has been regulated from 150bpm to between 68bpm and 88bpm and is regular and strong. I have no chest pain. My blood pressure however has dropped from an average of 120/86 to a minimum of 95/56 and an average of 98/64 with a pulse rate averaging 76bpm. I feel light headed and quite weak; and this is at rest as I am not back at work yet. I suspect it could be the actions of the Atenolol and the Avapro+HCT together lowering my blood pressure too much. My question is; can I stop taking the Avapro + HCT and simply continue with the other medications to hopefully raise my blood pressure slightly without increasing the risk of another infarction or tachycardic episode? Thank you.,2007,2007,47.0,Male,,,hello doctor five day ago I diagnos interior infarct I 47 yo male physic demand occup the doctor start plavix 75mg lipitor 20mg atenolol 25mg half 50mg daili I previous take avapro hct control hypertens the doctor advis continu take avapro hct sinc medic puls regul 150bpm 68bpm 88bpm regular strong I chest pain My blood pressur howev drop averag 12086 minimum 9556 averag 9864 puls rate averag 76bpm I feel light head quit weak rest I back work yet I suspect could action atenolol avaprohct togeth lower blood pressur much My question I stop take avapro hct simpli continu medic hope rais blood pressur slightli without increas risk anoth infarct tachycard episod thank

It happens randomly 3-5 times a week usually between 6-10PM. Her pulse could anywhere from 65-95 during the attacks. Her doctor gave Clonidine to control the pressure during the attacks. The attacks have been increasing in frequency. She had CT scan of her kidneys and adrenal glands and they were clean. It is a mystery to us and her doctors. I am afraid if could a condition is getting worse everyday and could be too late by the time we find out the real condition.

501,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi everyone Is heat intolerance the last symptom to go away when treating hyperthyroidism? Could it be something else besides hyperthyroidism? About 3 years ago I developed uncontrollable hypertension and some tachycardia. Only atenolol (up to 200 mg/day) was able to control it; although making me very weak; sleepy and depressed. Then blood tests revealed it was all caused by T3 hyperthyroidism. 2/10/2015 Free T3 5.09 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) high Free T4 1.21pg/ml (0.93-1.7) normal TSH 2.67 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) normal Antimicrosomal antibodies 15.95 IU/ml (less than 34 IU is considered negative) Low testosterone is said to continue until I no longer use Atenolol or Propranolol. On physical examination the Endocrinologist said he felt the thyroid gland is enlarged. After 6 weeks on 20mg/day Tapazol (Methimazole) Free T3 4.79 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) still high but less than before Free T4 0.92pg/ml (0.93-1.7) borderline low TSH 5.09 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) high Blood pressure is now much better controlled; almost using no Atenolol. But heat intolerance got worse. Is this normal? The endocrinologist kept me on 20 mg/day; next blood test scheduled for 5/14/2015. Because of my former hypertension and tachycardia he wants my free T3 to get into normal range (to prevent a heart attack or stroke) despite what happens with TSH and Free T4. He said me might try lowering Tapazole dosage once Free T3 gets back to normal. Will heat intolerance go away once my free T3 gets into normal range? Why am I responding so slow to Methimazole? Might it be because only my free T3 was high so now my free T4 is now low; so little reverse T3 is formed.,2015,2015,,Male,,,Hi everyon Is heat intoler last symptom go away treat hyperthyroid could someth els besid hyperthyroid about 3 year ago I develop uncontrol hypertens tachycardia onli atenolol 200 mgday abl control although make weak sleepi depress then blood test reveal caus T3 hyperthyroid 2102015 free T3 509 pgml 2044 high free T4 121pgml 09317 normal tsh 267 uiuml 027420 normal antimicrosom antibodi 1595 iuml less 34 IU consid neg low testosteron said continu I longer use atenolol propranolol On physic examin endocrinologist said felt thyroid gland enlarg after 6 week 20mgday tapazol methimazol free T3 479 pgml 2044 still high less free T4 092pgml 09317 borderlin low tsh 509 uiuml 027420 high blood pressur much better control almost use atenolol but heat intoler got wors Is normal the endocrinologist kept 20 mgday next blood test schedul 5142015 becaus former hypertens tachycardia want free T3 get normal rang prevent heart attack stroke despit happen tsh free T4 He said might tri lower tapazol dosag free T3 get back normal will heat intoler go away free T3 get normal rang whi I respond slow methimazol might free T3 high free T4 low littl revers T3 form

507,Atenolol+hypertension,Healthy 150 lb age 61; shaken when I had 1st recorded AFib Nov ’07 (after dental surgery) causing me to go on 25 mg. Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a night of AFib episode ( I was urinating frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out. After the fainting; cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on blocker); I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16 two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark below 50 & record beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin; they were going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on before I was switched off to Lisinopril). Since going to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress; very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp.

508,Atenolol+hypertension,I have mild MVP and had all the EKG's; Echo's; Holter and Event Monitor's galore. Always been told my heart is fine. When the MVP first started in my early 20's it was just Sinus Tachycardia. The older I have gotten the more PVC's have come ( I am 35). First it was ocassionally; now they are coming in a series and when they come one right after the other they feel more like flutters like it cant catch up and I feel nasueaous (not like the normal thud); but I have not felt faint at this point and it has shown my heartbeat to be irregular on blood pressure monitor but blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Once again told they were benign and my heart is fine. Put me on Atenolol 25 mg a day...told me I can increase if I need to; but it seems to me that this beta blocker makes me sleepy and depressed lowers my blood pressure and now I wonder if the slowing of the heart rate is not making my skips worse. Should I increase my atenolol; stop my atenolol or should I try Magnesium. I have heard alot of people say that Magnesium has helped them. If I do stop taking the atenolol I know you are not supposed to stop all together how should I wean myself off of it; again I take 25 mg a day...sometimes I even skip a day.,2007,2012,35.0,Female,,,I mild mvp ekg echo holter event monitor galor alway told heart fine when mvp first start earli 20 sinu tachycardia the older I gotten pvc come I 35 first ocassion come seri come one right feel like flutter like cant catch I feel nasueaou like normal thud I felt faint point shown heartbeat irregular blood pressur monitor blood pressur heart rate normal onc told benign heart fine put atenolol 25 mg daytold I increas I need seem beta blocker make sleepi depress lower blood pressur I wonder slow heart rate make skip wors should I increas atenolol stop atenolol I tri magnesium I heard alot peopl say magnesium help If I stop take atenolol I know suppos stop togeth I wean I take 25 mg daysometim I even skip day

511,Atenolol+hypertension,"Had concerns about ""funny"" feeling once in a while; like skips or flutters in heart. Had been told on 2 most recent visits to Urgent Care for virus symptoms and then to quick check before cataract surgery by nurse that I had a heart murmur. I saw a cardiologist. He put me on 25MG Atenolol and after doing a Echo he added Diovan 80MG. My blood pressure has never run high--only put on Atenolol as my pulse rate on 1st check was 118. When I went for Echo a month later blood pressure was 125 over 85 and pulse rate was 58. No problems found with Echo---he can hear a very slight murmur but nothing to be concerned about. He wanted me to add 2nd med and come back in about 3 months. I asked about side effects and Dr. stated very little side effects.

512,Atenolol+hypertension,"I suffer from labile blood pressure. My typical pressure is about 115/62 (based on hourly monitoring); but at the doctor's office or when I'm having a migraine it can shoot up to 180/100. My doctor wants to put me on beta blockers to help control my pressure and also to help my migraines. I have two questions that he did not know the answer to: 1) Will the beta blockers lower my ""normal"" blood pressure below what it already is? And will this cause a problem with dizzyness and blacking out? 2) I'm middle aged and about 10 pounds over my ideal weight. Will losing a few pounds help with labile blood pressure?

My PCP & cardiologist initially Rx'd weight loss; stimulant avoidance; Aspirin 325mg & Atenolol 25mg/day. All labs values were normal. 24-Hr. Holter showed NSR except for 1 palpitation x 2-3 minutes. Baseline echo results after meds started: Normal left ventricular function; Mild mitral regurgitation (advised SBE prophylaxis); Peak TR regurgitation velocity of 1.46 m/s & Peak RV systolic pressure 8.5 mmHg greater than RA pressure. This last reading - peak RV systolic pressure 8.5 mmHg > RA pressure - apparently is below the normal range of 20-30 mmHg. Can you tell me what could be the causes/implications of this low reading? My cardiologist said he would be more concerned if the readings were above the normal range. To date/14 months later; my A-F/palpitation episode freqency has increased. My cardiologist increased my Atenolol dosage to 25mg; 2x/day & felt another echo is not necessary at this time. If the AF frequency/duration increase further; then rhythm control meds could be considered. What are your thoughts on this plan? Thank you very much.

517,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been on beta-blockers for 5 years. I'm 33 now. My doctor put my on beta-blockers for hypertension; and a fairly high heart rate. On the beta-blockers I may have developed Peyronie's Disease; so the doctor took me off of the beta-blockers last week. I was on atenolol 25mg; once a day. He told me to stop the beta-blocker cold turkey and take an ACE Inhibitor. The ACE Inhibitor is keeping the blood pressure normal; about 118/78. But the heart rate is 85 to 110 when sitting. Mostly it's 80 and 90's when sitting; but sometimes it hits 100 or more. The heart feels more rapid when up moving around and doing things. He told me to stop the atenolol right away; but I took 12.5 for 4 days; and now I haven't taken any for 3 days.

It just happened again and I checked my blood pressure and pulse; BP was 168/108 w/pulse of 116. I have been treated for mild hypertension for the last few years with atenolol. (diastolic pressures have been in low to mid 90s). My son has LQTS; and we have all been checked for it; with negative results (testing was EKG). Six months ago I had a strange episode where I felt sudden chest pain/pressure with sweating which lasted approximately 10-15 minutes and slowly subsided. I had an EKG done a few days later which was within normal limits. Because of symptoms; a stress thalium test was done which was inconclusive. A cardiac cath was then performed; which did not show any blockages. So; it was decided to continue treating the hypertension with atenolol. I do not understand why I continue to have these strange heartbeat episodes; and if there might be something wrong.

520,Atenolol+hypertension,"42 yr old woman...5 weeks pregnant...(this will be my 4th child) I have been taking atenolol for approx. 8 yrs. - prescribed to reduce ""skipped heartbeats"" which caused anxiety/panic attacks. When first given dose was 25mg each day. OB/GYN that I have scheduled an appointment with (have never been seen by him) said that ideally he would like me off the atenolol since it is not for hypertension. I have low blood pressure (averages 102/60 most of the time). I did see a cardiologist 4 yrs ago (holter/ekg/echo)..all good...some pvcs...but nothing unusual. Tried to stop the atenolol in the past...3/4 of a tablet for 1 week; 1/2 tab for a week; then 1/4 tab for a week. It went well but 6 weeks later the skipped beats came back; more flutters; feeling shaky afterward and of course anxiety about it all! Started the atenolol again (1/2 tab) and things settled down(this has been about the last 3 yrs). Stopped the atenolol 2 days ago and today I had episodes of skipped beats (10-20/hr)... don't get so panicky about it anymore since I visited an anxiety specialist (fyi; I never had an anxiety or panic attack until I had an episode of skipped beats and palpitations) Also had the stomach flu yesterday with a fever ( 99-100)! My questions... 1. Is there a good way to discontinue the atenolol? 2. Is discontinuation the better choice while pregnant? 3. Is there a better(safer) beta-blocker to use when pregnant? 4. The increased skipped beats could be the result of being sick and pregnant rather than my stopping the atenolol; right? 5. Should I request to re-visit the cardiologist when I see the OB/GYN so they are in sync?

521,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'am a long time sufferer{17 years} of PVC's who's had all the non-invasive tests including a ""normal"" thallium stress test. With the basic understanding that at least some arrhythmias are caused by some type of cardiac problem such as CAD etc at what point does one request more invasive testing testing like cathierization{sp} to rule out blockage? I mean if I were to explore ablation shouldn't one positively rule out all root causes before a procedure like ablation is undertaken? Also I'll ask you to speculate; the docs on this forum have often stated that PVC's can be associated with hypertension or a result of it. Do you think this is because high BP in some way effects the heart to precipitate the PVC's or is it that the type of person who is prone to high BP {""type A""; etc} is also prone to PVC's? And why then when BP is controlled to normal levels do PVC's not stop? I realize these last couple of questions likely have no real answers just wondering what your intuition leads you to believe.

My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern.

I know the brochure I got with it; says it can take time to get into my system. But...one thing when I was on the Atenolol...my heartrate very very rarely EVER went out of the 60s. Even when I was active. Oh; sure; if I climbed stairs it would rise up; sometimes near 120 tops; but it fell right away too. I also never felt my heart beat; or pound a bit...EXCLUDING the times when I was having palpitations..of course I feel it then..but when Im just relaxing; I didnt feel it. ALSO...when on the Atenolol; i could even skip a dose..and my heartrate would stay down. Now..on this new med...gosh; if its even fairly close to the time that my next dose is due; and I; say; take a flight of stairs; or make a couple trips carrying heavy groceries; my heart is beating pretty fast. I timed it at 132 bpm; after I carried some groceries in ( its a rather long walk..heavy bags). I dont LIKE this new med; I dont think!! I want my HR to always be nice and low like it was on the Atenl!! But then; maybe im not giving it a chance? Its only been 4 days that ive been on it. I have a follow up appt with the Dr at the end of August..he wanted me to give this medicine about a month..then come and see him. Anybody out there ever go from Atenolol; to Metoprolol..and actually LIKE it?? Ever have this sensation of knowing when its wearing off?

531,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 55 yo female scheduled for a dubutamine stress test next week and I'm pretty scared. I had an adeosine stress test several years ago but they couldn't get my heart rate up during that test and that test was awful! I felt like I was going to pass out.

533,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi...I'm a 32 year old female 5'3 & 130 lbs. I've had to take Atenolol for about 8 months. I was put on this med when my BP skyrocketed to 175/118 (I was also sent to the hospital). I have no high BP in my family; weight is normal and I'm too young for this. My doctor attributed my high BP to the Effexor I was taking. I just switched to Wellbutrin and have read that this will also cause a rise in BP. Should I be worried about this? Or will the Atenolol keep working (it also helps with my anxiety). I just don't know what is better...go off the AD and be miserable or take the Atenolol and worry that I'll have a stroke one day.

Not completely numb or non sensitive but some kind of strange numbness; the rare thing is that I've been having this sensation for the entire day. Now I don't know if this might be because of any of the medication I use to take (Paxil; Xanax; Atenolol; Losartan) or if it's there another cause.

I was admitted to the hospital; diagnosed with vasculitus; (limited wegner's vasculitus in sinuses) within days; following this reaction. Recently I discovered that the warnings on Atenenol say; to never stop Atenenol suddenly; due to harmful reactions. Vasculitus is on the list of possible reactions form Atenenol; in looking over the MEd-web. Is this a fact; that stopping Atenenol suddenly is very likely the cause of the vasculitus?

The patient walked 11 minutes and reached 13.4 mets. 95% to his target heart rate. The patient was short of breath and had chest pain. The Ekg did not really show anything significant. The nuclear images were negative other than the RV showed up prominently on the stress study. An echo showed neg but had 3 small leaky valves. Why would the RV only show up on the Stress imaging. No lung uptake was seen. NO TID levels increased and no Lung heart ratio increase. My concern are we overlooking something.

If I take a deep breath or get up; my heart pounds and the rate jumps well over 120 BPM. This typically last just for a few minutes. I understand adrenaline and cortisol are at play; but I sense there's a rush of these molecules for some reason. It doesn't happen at any other time. And I wouldn't worry at all except for the fact that the four times I've had atrial fib it was spawned by this rapid rise in heart rate after waking and at no other time.

549,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern. What typically used to be 120-125/70-72 has started to creep up to systolic pressures in the 145-155 range with little or no change of the diastolic pressure. It seems as I age; presently 64; isolated systolic hypertension is beginning to appear as it did with my parents.

550,Atenolol+hypertension,For the past few months I've been experiencing a lot of pressure and a throbbing; pulsing feeling in the back of my head (at the base); my neck; and the same pressure and pulsing feeling in my eyes; but its usually one eye at a time. Laying down usually makes it worse; unless I lay in just the right way which is new every time. I've read a lot online and everything says its pressure; stress; anxiety; or tension; but I honestly don't think its either. I've put hot rags and other things to relax my muscles; but that never seems to make a different. It never happens at a stressful time in my life either. Last time it happened was on vacation! My neck also starts to feel wobbly; like my head is too heavy or something. I'm really starting to worry; its almost as if there is excess fluid in the back of my head or something; if that makes any sense. But every time it happens; one of my eyes is also affected. It gets to where all I can do is close my eyes to make the pain somewhat go away. Does anyone know what this could be? Every part of me is telling me its NOT a tension/anxiety thing. Part of me thinks its more sinus related than stress related.. But I haven't had any sinus problems lately and I'm still feeling it. Anyone know what I'm describing? Oh and just some background info: I have been diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and I'm on atenolol for it.

My doc prescribed me atenolol(a beta blocker) for my hypertension 40mg once daily. but since my metanephrine result was a bit high; i suspect it might be early pheochromocytoma although the doctor says it is not. he said that people with adrenal tumors have much higher catecholomine levels which is twice or thrice the normal level of 0.9 My question is this; although the atenolol seems to control my hypertension; i have read in an online article that a ""pure"" beta blocker such as atenolol must never be used in the presence of a pheochromocytoma due to the risk of such treatment leading to unopposed alpha agonism and; thus; severe and potentially refractory hypertension.’ Please advise if i can use atenolol or i should go for an alternative BP medication",2010,2010,32.0,Male,,,I abus ephedrin caffein past weight loss now I got urinari frequenc gastrointestin disord use 3 month back My BP read like 13090 home In doctor offic 140100 I got anxieti panic attack side effect also stress recent health problem echo ecg normal I got 24hr metanephrin urin test catecholomin result 13 bit elev normal expect result 09 My doc prescrib atenolola beta blocker hypertens 40mg daili sinc metanephrin result bit high suspect might earli pheochromocytoma although doctor say said peopl adren tumor much higher catecholomin level twice thrice normal level 09 My question although atenolol seem control hypertens read onlin articl pure beta blocker atenolol must never use presenc pheochromocytoma due risk treatment lead unoppos alpha agon thu sever potenti refractori hypertens pleas advis use atenolol go altern BP medic

553,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 24 year othersise healthy male. Recently I was diagnosed with mild LVH and hypertension. This may be due to the following facts that have occured in past 4-5 years; unhealthy lifestyle; unhealthy eating; 30-35 lbs of weight gain; etc. My doctor thinks due to these factors I might have had mild and borderline high bp resulting into LVH. Is this a fair assumption? Right now; I am taking Atenolol 25 mg per day which seems to be helping. My question is with a proper care; and proper lifesyle; can I bring back my heart to normal? Can I reduce the BP and not have to be dependent on medicine for rest of my life? With 25mg of atenolol a day; the home pressure reading is below 120/80 in average and at the grocery stores; it is about 128-134/80-86. Is this Ok? Thank you.

554,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 46 yr old female; severely overweight. On 50 mg atenolol 2x daily; for mild-moderate hypertension. Have had benign palps for 15+ years. Have had all the tests-including a Thallium stress test ( about 7 yrs ago) and a holter as recent as 7 months ago. I have been told over the years that my palps are stress related; and am on Lexapro; and Xanax used as needed-I have GAD and panic attacks. My palps came back a year ago after being gone for a long time. After an ER visit; where I was put thru blood work; monitors; Chest xrays; etc ( this was about a year and a half ago) I was sent home being told all was fine. Iam pretty much sedentary--my job is an 8 hr desk job-I do come home and do housework--but no exercise on a daily basis. My question--I am trying to lose weight now. I have been ( for about 8 months now) taking the stairs DOWN ( no; not up..not yet) when I leave work each day. Thats 8 flights of steps. Then a walk to the car which is usually the length of a city block. When I get to the car; Iam winded-my pulse ranges from 95-113 when I first get in the car.( thats with the Atenolol). It drops within a minute or two; back to my normal range; which is upper 60s; low 70's. I have noticed that the palpitations really fire up; immediatly after I sit down. After the steps and walking stops. I do not notice them during the steps and walking. On the drive home; my palps are firing pretty good. I keep thinking; this is the time my heart will just stop. Should I stop taking the stairs down? Its something Ive done for quite a while...and have had the palps. I have off and on every day.,2007,2008,46.0,Female,,,I 46 yr old femal sever overweight On 50 mg atenolol 2x daili mildmoder hypertens have benign palp 15 year have testsinclud thallium stress test 7 yr ago holter recent 7 month ago I told year palp stress relat lexapro xanax use neededi gad panic attack My palp came back year ago gone long time after ER visit I put thru blood work monitor chest xray etc year half ago I sent home told fine iam pretti much sedentarymi job 8 hr desk jobi come home houseworkbut exercis daili basi My questioni tri lose weight I 8 month take stair down upnot yet I leav work day that 8 flight step then walk car usual length citi block when I get car iam windedmi puls rang 95113 I first get car that atenolol It drop within minut two back normal rang upper 60 low 70 I notic palpit realli fire immediatli I sit after step walk stop I notic step walk On drive home palp fire pretti good I keep think time heart stop should I stop take stair it someth ive done quit whileand palp I everi day
555,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My son is 23; single; non smoker; non drinker; student. He did not have BP before 8 months. His BP range is 140-96 average. Doctor did some test of blood and urine and also did sonography and found nothing. He proscribed Atenolol 50 mg (half tablet a day). Do you think he should go for some more tests to know the reason of high BP? Does he have any alternative of medication? like controlled exercise; Diet etc. Doctor said; BP is the result of stress; but stress is a part of modern life.

At 16; was diagnosed with MVP. I work at a school; so I went down to have BP checked; it was 140/94. IT kept going up; after a week of getting it checked; I went to my FP. He checked it it was 155/110. He put me on Atenolol 25 mg. that didnt work so he increased it to 50 mg. I was sent for echo; which they found; mild mitral valve regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. I had the stress test; holtor monitor; kidneys checked. They were all okay. My father had heart disease and his mother did also. My question is ""IS this a progressive thing?"" Are the HBP and the valvular disease correllated? Or is a seperate issue? Im trying to make sense of this? I get this pulsating in my neck; and pounding in my chest alot. I was told its nothing to worry about. Its very uncomfortable feeling!

558,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

560,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had an echocardiogram. The conclusions from the cardiologist report are left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 75%. Evidence of early diastolic function. Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. I am age 60. I would appreciate some feedback on this. I have high blood pressure and take Lotrel and hydrochlorthiazide.. I am considering a beta blocker if the doctor insists. The cardiologist told me the results were not bad; but heart is slightly stiff. I know that is diastolic dysfunction. Are there meds for that condition?

561,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a healthy 25 year old guy. I'm very physically active. I run 2-3 miles 5 times a week and lift weights as well. Hypertension runs in my family. I am currently taking 7.5mg Enalapril and 25mg Atenolol a day. This keeps my hypertension at bay. Typical readings are 120-138/80. I've had blood tests; cholesterol is great; blood sugar is fine. Last year I had a Stress+Echo (November 2009). Everything came out normal. I've had PVCs as long as I can remember. My concern is i'm a lot more aware of them now; and they typically occur with exercise. I notice them sometimes after i've done a set on bench press; or after i've run a couple of miles. I don't get a lot of PVCs in a given day (maybe 2-5 that are symptomatic). I probably am aware of PVCs say 3 times a week. Stress/Worry/Thinking about PVCs exacerbates them. Do you think I have anything to be concerned about? The stress+echo last november showed I have a perfectly healthy heart. Due to being concerned about this; I am scheduled to see a cardiologist next Friday. Could I go into V-Tach or even worse V-Fib and die? Do you think I should have an echocardiogram and holter monitor?

My heart rate went up the day the pain started and has not come down. without a beta blocker it is around 90's sitting the second I put my feet down to stand up it goes to to the 120+ comes down and goes up with minimal work. I know these are symptoms of IST but I wanted to see if you think this could be a pheo. I know they are very rare but do happen. if it was just the heart rate I wouldnt question it but with the head aches that I never got before and the pain the blood pressure going up even on the beta blocker over heating and the new cafe au lait spots could this be a pheo or only IST what else should I be tested for it they think it is IST...

568,Atenolol+hypertension,Please feel free to read my other thread in this forum for a detailed history of my anxiety problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night.,2009,2009,29.0,Male,,,pleas feel free read thread forum detail histori anxieti problem My recent issu I wake middl night elev puls skyrocket within moment wake I went back cardiologist thursday told ekg show thicken heart muscl she review echo two year ago told show sign thicken well I went cardiologist hope allay health anxieti wors Im bit mif doctor didnt keep inform go echo all I ever heard valv leak bit abnorm amount age 29 Im go new echo monday ill stress test soon the stress test scare ive got stay atenolol 48 hour hand ill deal puls elev probabl wors incid heart race Im look reassur anyon give hope someon similar I feel healthi Im deal stuff everi night
569,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had a consistent bp reading of 154/96 and above for several months now. I have been on diuretics but they have made no difference at all. I am due another visit to the bp clinic on the 27th of this month. If this reading is the same then I am to go on another medication and Atenolol (sp) was mentioned. I must admit to being a little concerned about all this as the nurse mentioned to me several side effects. Are there cases where the tablets work without any effects?

572,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question regard to the medication call Atenlol. I am 32 yeasr old female; and have several people who's got high blood pressure in my family (all Asian). I was diagnosed as High blood pressure couple weeks ago. I had my nose bleeding for couple of days after my dental surgery the other day. Right before the oral surgeon put me on to sleep; he said my blood pressure was very high; and asked me if I am taking any medication for this. The surgeon ignored my high blood pressure since I never had high blood pressure in my life; and thought probably because I was nervous. (it was 178/148 that day) For 4 days after the surgery; my nose bleed in the morning everyday. I thought it was caused from my dental surgery so I went to see my family doctor. My doctor thought that nose bleed is nothing to do with neither my dental surgery nor my high blood pressure. She thought the high blood pressure was caused by my anti-depression,2007,2007,,,,,hello I question regard medic call atenlol I 32 yeasr old femal sever peopl who got high blood pressur famili asian I diagnos high blood pressur coupl week ago I nose bleed coupl day dental surgeri day right oral surgeon put sleep said blood pressur high ask I take medic the surgeon ignor high blood pressur sinc I never high blood pressur life thought probabl I nervou 178148 day for 4 day surgeri nose bleed morn everyday I thought caus dental surgeri I went see famili doctor My doctor thought nose bleed noth neither dental surgeri high blood pressur she thought high blood pressur caus antidepress

574,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I am a white 46 year old male who was diagonosed with hypertension in 1994. Since that time I have been a variety of drugs including diaretics; ACE inhibitors; Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers. I am currently taking Atenolol 50 mg; Felodipine 10 mg and Maxzide 25 mg; and have yet to be controlled for more than 2 months (lower than 140/90). I also am taking Colestid 4 gr x 2 day for High Cholesterol (HDL 59; LDL 153). In 1995 I was admitted to a German hospital with a BP reaction to prescribed Motrin; whereupon I was tested with: 24 hour BP check; ECG; abdominal ultrasound; stress test and a Farbdoppler ECG; with no out of ordinary results. I have recently been tested again with a renal ultrasound and 24 urine test for a renal tumor with negative results. I am about to retire from the military and would really like to get this under control. I have a consult with a cardiac specialist at the end of the month.

575,Atenolol+hypertension,I have several questions concerning HDL. The last two times I have had my lipids tested my HDL has been quite low (TC 226; LDL 145; HDL 35; trig 225 and after dietary changes; exercise etc. TC 193; HDL 26). 1) I just recently attended a lipids workshop and the cardiologist mentioned a drug called Niaspan that is supposed to lower LDL; raise HDL; and lower triglycerides. I got the impression that this is a new drug and does not have the side effects that taking niacin can have. Is that true? 2) In the literature we received it said that beta blockers (I take 25 mg atenolol daily for questionable hypertension) can lower HDL. I never had my HDL measured before starting atentolol so I don't know if it has had any effect on my HDL level. 3) If I understand it correctly; the statins work by lowering the LDL. Yet Lipitor claims in its advertisements to raise the HDL as well. Is is worth taking this drug mainly to raise the HDL? I'm not sure what my LDL Is now; the second test I had was just a screening but I would think it would probably be a bit lower than the 145 it was the first time.

578,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia; left arm weakness and tingling sensation; irregular periods and suffer from anxiety/occassional panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG and low phosphorus. Not sure if this plays any part in thyroid issues as well.

587,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 36yo male who is looking for a bit of advice. My liver is inflamed and has been for some time; the last 3 L.F.T. results have showed rapid increase in G.G.T. levels and I am seeing my Doctor tomorrow (Public Holiday today) to get the result of the 4th L.F.T. The Doc said if the 4th L.F.T. is any worse he is referring me to a Liver disease specialist. Last night after cooking dinner I got a huge dizzy spell and went blind for 1-2 seconds and at 2am while I was trying to sleep in my air conditioned bedroom (AC set to 20 Degrees C) I suddenly felt as if the room went up to over 50 Degrees C and immediately began to sweat profusely and felt like my heart was going to explode and I had difficulty breathing. This only lasted about 15-20 seconds but it was quite frightening. I got up and chugged a glass of lemonade and went back to bed. The episode repeated itself at 4:30am and I got up and had a drink again. I will be discussing these weird symptoms tomorrow with my doctor; but I am looking for advice on if this issue could be related to my liver issues or could it be something else.

589,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 23 year's old. I recently began to have extreme trouble with dizziness (about 3 months ago) and was told I had high blood pressure. They put me on Lisinopril. I ended up in the hospital a month later (Christmas Day) with chest pains. They then told me they thought the Lisinopril was to blame. They took me off Lisinopril and put me on Atenolol. The Atenolol (over the course of a couple of weeks) lowered my pulse rate too much and started causing my heart rate to become irregular. I ended up back in the hospital where they took me off of the Atenolol and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide. Unfortunately; it too seems to be disagreeing with me; and we still haven't figured out what the cause of it all is. I'll occasionally wake up in the middle of the night; sometimes right after I fall asleep; with a sudden jerking feeling and a need to breathe which usually raises my blood pressure bad. This would lead me to believe I had sleep apnea or something similar; but this doesn't always happen; and the majority of the time; my blood pressure is bad during the day as well. They've done numerous blood tests; thyroid tests; heart and kidney ultrasounds; elecrocardiograms; ran nuclear stuff through my blood stream and tracked it through an MRI; done chest x-rays; stress tests; and hooked me to heart monitors. So far; everything turns up fine according to everyone. I'm still having heart pains; irregular heart beats; bad dizziness; and my blood pressure runs high almost daily.I've been living off of grilled chicken salads with no dressing and drinking water for the past three months; but even a switch in diet doesn't seem to have helped. I really hope I can figure this out soon. My blood pressure this morning was 126/110... the bottom number being the highest it has for some time; while the top was actually low for once. However; the pulse was also 110; and I was only laying down still sleeping just moments before I checked it. I also had an irregular heartbeat once again.,2010,2010,23.0,Male,,,Im 23 year old I recent began extrem troubl dizzi 3 month ago told I high blood pressur they put lisinopril I end hospit month later christma day chest pain they told thought lisinopril blame they took lisinopril put atenolol the atenolol cours coupl week lower puls rate much start caus heart rate becom irregular I end back hospit took atenolol put hydrochlorithiazid unfortun seem disagre still havent figur caus ill occasion wake middl night sometim right I fall asleep sudden jerk feel need breath usual rais blood pressur bad thi would lead believ I sleep apnea someth similar doesnt alway happen major time blood pressur bad day well theyv done numer blood test thyroid test heart kidney ultrasound elecrocardiogram ran nuclear stuff blood stream track mri done chest xray stress test hook heart monitor So far everyth turn fine accord everyon Im still heart pain irregular heart beat bad dizzi blood pressur run high almost dailyiv live grill chicken salad dress drink water past three month even switch diet doesnt seem help I realli hope I figur soon My blood pressur morn 126110 bottom number highest time top actual low howev puls also 110 I lay still sleep moment I check I also irregular heartbeat

593,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctors; I am a 31 year old woman with a pacemaker and poorly controlled atrial arrhythmias. I am currently taking atenolol 25mg day and frankly find it doing a better job with my migraine headaches than with my heart. So I am essentially stuck on it. I am concerned that in the past my echocardiograms were normal and now I had one just recently that showed that I had mild pulmonary hypertension with right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. I also have a moderate tricuspid valve insufficiency. All of these findings are new. AND with exertion over time I have noticed that I get extremely short of breath. I get depressed knowing that I have so much difficulty just trying to climb a couple stairs. I do have some sort of connective tissue disorder that has not been clearly diagnosed yet. But my key interest is with my pacemaker. I am on my second. The first one was a dual chamber single lead that turned out to be very useless and causing me more problems. So I was upgraded to a dual-chamber; dual-lead; pacer--the left in the old wire so now I have three wires in my heart and two of them going into my ventricle. I am not sure if the pacemaker could be contributing to my new heart findings. However; despite all this; my doctor's office (Internist) never informed me of the new echo findings (I requested the echo on my own volition through my internist. I was told in the past that another echo would be unnecessary). I am very disappointed and have begun to wonder if I should just give up pursuing this. Any feedback would be very appreciated.,2002,2002,,,,,dear doctor I 31 year old woman pacemak poorli control atrial arrhythmia I current take atenolol 25mg day frankli find better job migrain headach heart So I essenti stuck I concern past echocardiogram normal I one recent show I mild pulmonari hypertens right atrial right ventricular enlarg I also moder tricuspid valv insuffici all find new and exert time I notic I get extrem short breath I get depress know I much difficulti tri climb coupl stair I sort connect tissu disord clearli diagnos yet but key interest pacemak I second the first one dual chamber singl lead turn useless caus problem So I upgrad dualchamb duallead pacerth left old wire I three wire heart two go ventricl I sure pacemak could contribut new heart find howev despit doctor offic internist never inform new echo find I request echo volit internist I told past anoth echo would unnecessari I disappoint begun wonder I give pursu ani feedback would appreci
594,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; First of all thank you for the advice! It is very much appreciated. I am a healthy 25 year old male; with the exception of being treated for hypertension. I am currently on 25 mg of Atenolol and 10 mg of Enalapril. My blood pressure is controlled; under 140/90. My concern is PVCs!!! They are driving me crazy. They tend to be cyclical throughout the year. Sometimes they are really bad; and for the past month they have been. Last year I had all the cardiac tests done. Echocardiogram; Stress+Echo; Stress Test and Holter Monitor. All checked out fine. The Echocardiogram was done 6 months ago. I remember the technician for the Echo saying my Left Ventricle Wall Thickness was around 10 or 11 mm; on the upper end of of a ""Normal"" range Left Ventricle Wall Thickness. My follow up appointment the cardiologist yielded no concerns. She felt like I did not need to see a cardiologist anymore. The thing is I lift HEAVY weights 3 times a week. Squats; Deadlifts; Bench Press....... For 5 sets of 5 reps as heavy as I can possibly lift. Lifting is very important to me. It is a great stress reliever for me; and I enjoy the results I see. I swear it has lowered my resting blood pressure. I also run 3 miles 3 times a week. All the doctors I have seen see no issue with me lifting weights. I never hold my breath (valsalva maneuver) when lifting. For the most part I have PVCs with exertion - running or walking around after sitting at my desk at work for an hour or so. Do you think the heavy weight lifting could have caused me to have left ventricle hypertrophy since I had the Echo 6 months ago? Are the PVCs with exercise/exertion a signal of this? I went to the cardiologist office last week and saw a nurse's practitioner. She did a resting ECG and checked my blood pressure. All were fine. She did not seem concerned. Should I have another Echo to make sure I do not have LVH? I am hopeing this is just anxiety and I do not have a structural heart issue.

595,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I've been taking a beta blocker for over a year now; at first I started taking it every day for about 8 months. Now I'm only taking it during the week; it does help me a lot to function like a 'normal' person. I do suffer from a bit of depression; but overall I'm generally a happy person. I'm a young man; mid 20s. I was prescribed this medicine by my local doctor and have been taking it ever since; I went to see a shrink shortly after but haven't been since. I don't take them on the weekends; and I've stopped taking them in the mornings because of constant tiredness at work. I only take half a tablet each day (25mg). My question is: am I causing long term damage to my body by taking this everyday? Suffer from severe social anxiety; I still suffer from the social anxiety when taking the medicine; except the blushing isn't as severe.,2008,2008,,,,,Hi ive take beta blocker year first I start take everi day 8 month now Im take week help lot function like normal person I suffer bit depress overal Im gener happi person Im young man mid 20 I prescrib medicin local doctor take ever sinc I went see shrink shortli havent sinc I dont take weekend ive stop take morn constant tired work I take half tablet day 25mg My question I caus long term damag bodi take everyday suffer sever social anxieti I still suffer social anxieti take medicin except blush isnt sever

597,Atenolol+hypertension,Six weeks ago I had oral surgery for an abscessed tooth and shortly thereafter had angina for about a week. It has subsided completely at present. At the time of the angina bouts I saw my Dr who did a nuclear stress test. It showed some ischemia in the lower regions of the heart so he sent me to a cardioligist who has prescribed me atenalol while I wait for an ultra fast CT scan. My BP was 128/88 or what they called the 'high side of normal'. I am cautious about using drugs if there are alternatives. I am reading a lot of complaints from people with side effects; tiredness; depression; nightmares; etc on this drug. Are these people the 1-5% the drug company claim or is the problem more widespread? At the same time; I have devoured mountains of material on CHD and find an alarming difference of opinions between researchers and even between cardioligists themselves about whether beta blockers are a good step. 90% of research says beta blockers do nothing to prevent 1st heart attacks in people with angina. 10% of the research says they do prevent 1st heart attacks. Numerous cardiologists say they are lifesavers; while others say avoid them; or that there are more effective classes of drugs. The research does favor beta blockers for those who have had a heart attack and want to avoid a second one; but I have only had a brief spell of angina and am not getting them now so would rather work on the Ornish; Esselstyn plant based reversal plans drug free if I can. Is this wise or should I use the atenalol?

598,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

599,Atenolol+hypertension,I am on low doses of atenolol 25 mg.for mild hypertension 145/95. I will need to take Larium (Melfoquine) for malaria prophylaxis for 8 weeks. Are there any reports of untoward cardiac reactions when these drugs are taken together? I had a period of PVC's lasting for 8 months at 250 PVC's per day. One year ago I went back into normal rhythm and do not have any except for an occasional one. Thanks for any answer.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jim: Atenolol and mefloquine can potentially interact. Their concurrent use can cause abnormalities on the electrocardiogram; there are reports of cardiac arrest from simultaneous use of these drugs. In addition; mefloquine can cause extra heart beats (PVCs); while atenolol can suppress them. Using two or more medications simultaneously always raises the possibility of drug interactions. The risks of possible interactions need to be weighed against the benefits of the medications. This is something that is best done by your own doctor; who knows you and your medical history. Do not stop taking atenolol without consulting your physician; as sudden cessation of this class of medications can cause problems. If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a cardiologist. Information provided in the Heart Forum is for general purposes only.

600,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm on a low dose of Atenolol (25mg once daily) for a fast heartbeat. After eating a large meal my heartrate will be around 70-110 but feels faster because of the bad palpitations. Usually around 3 hours after that meal my heartrate will slow back down to 50-70 but the palpitations sometimes continue making me feel uncomfortable. Anyways; I just walked up my stairs and my heartrate went up to about 130 with very bad palpitations and I could feel and hear my heartbeat in my ear. This has happened before on morning afters of heavy drinking. It doesn't happen often but when it does it's pretty scary. I couldn't check my blood pressure when I went upstairs cause my blood pressure machine was downstairs. When I came back down and checked it it was good at 123/79 and heartrate was 57. In April of this year I had an echo done and it showed 2nd degree diastolic disfunction but normal size and ejection fraction and an ekg showed leftward axis. What would cause this hearing and feeling of my heartbeat in my ear; this time it was just my left ear. If you have any questions; please ask.

601,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. Blood pressure had been well controlled in the past with Norvasc 10mg 1x daily and Metroprolol 25mg 2x daily. However; most recently; experiencing high blood pressure since the Nephrologist switched the Norvasc to Lorsartan 100mg 1x daily. Readings have been in the mid 160's even in the 170's. In addition; the Metroprolol was discontinued (it wasn't really helping the heart palpations) and have been prescribed Atenolol 25mg 1x daily for the heart palpitations. Now; Dr is adding Nifedipine 30mg 1x daily to try and lower blood pressure. Is it okay to take Atenolol 25 mg 1x daily; Lorsartan 100mg and the Nifedpine 30mgs?

602,Atenolol+hypertension,"I totally can. I told my doc this and she said it was. I'm a 26 year old male; non smoker. The thing is; lately I've been feeling it go up and down quickly. It feels like an uncomfortable pressure in my head and chest with a slowing heart until my heart ""thumps"" and the pressure subsides. This happens quite often during the evening; usually when I'm standing up doing very little exertion. It doesn't happen as often when I'm laying down but it is still there. I'm coming off of a beta blocker (currently at 6.25mg...i'm very sensitive so I have to come off of it very slow). I'm on a low sodium diet (mostly whole foods) and I take a proton pump inhibitor. I suspect I may be low on some electrolytes. I had some blood work done last month but; for some reason; my doc didn't order an electrolyte test. I've been taking the PPI for probably close to 10 years now. Perhaps this is another explanation? Any ideas what I'm up against? This happened but to a MUCH lesser extent when I was at full dose (25mg twice daily) of atenolol. It never hurts but I'm forced to stop whatever I'm doing until it fixes itself. It's very uncomfortable and my heart will thump sometimes to fix it. It's not PVCs because the heart isn't stopping momentarily. I know what PVCs feel like. This happens to coincide when my heart gradually slowly down for a few beats before correcting itself back to the normal rhythm. Any ideas?

603,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old female with a pacemaker; that was placed about a year ago after a sinus node ablation. Now I am in A-Fib on/off all day. I now take coumadin; verapamil; metoprolol and tambocor. The meds. have never worked. My E.P. Dr. said he doesn't think meds. will work and says I need to choose between a new catheter ablation procedure; or an av node ablation. I am very symptomatic as well. I can't lay down at night without several pillows (can't catch my breath; and I feel like my head will pop there's so much pressure; and I have trouble exerting etc.) A recent echo. showed mild tricuspid regurg.; and mild mitral regurg.; also mild pulmonary hypertension; I can't remember what else). I also had a recent V.Q. scan (my internist ordered)because I get very sharp pains at times when I breath in. The result was low-probability. No follow-up after that. I also have a patent foramen ovale. My questions are as follows: A)Do you you have any ideas what would cause chronic a fib after a sinus node ablation? B)Do you have an opinion as to which procedure is best to teat A-Fib? My Dr. seems very confused about what to do. C)Also I'm wondering about what mild pulmonary hypertension may indicate; and should it be followed up? D) Does a low-probobility v.q. scan correlate to pulmonary hypertension? E)Should I tell my E.P. DR. the results of the V.Q. scan the internist did? I'm sure the rsesults are probobaly insignificant but none of it was explained to me so I'm a little curious.

Mom did have chronic bronchitis and later asthma; pneumonia a number of times. (Mom had 2 bypasses and a MVR and died of CHF). Dad worked with chemicals for printed circuitry; don't know if that means anything. We lived in front of a furniture factory that left paint all over surfaces in our yard and in the kitchen window.

605,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently visited a cardiologist in Miami; Florida after having severe intermittent chest pain over the past couple of years. I also suffer from pac's and pvc's and bouts of fast heartrate. I had a stress test and holter monitor done in 1987; everthing was completely normal and was assured not worry. After having a severe bout of pvc's/pac's in 1998; my doctor put me on atenolol 25mg twice daily which I must admit controlled the palpitations so well I almost feel cured. I don't suffer the side effects of most beta blockers for which I am grateful; mostly only nightmares. I decided to visit a cardiologist after suffering from severe attacks of chest pain; which my doctor diagnosed as costachondritis. The cardiologist did an EKG and an echocardiogram after I told him of my symtoms. He said my symtoms were not anginal and that my ekg and echo were normal besides showing marginal concentric left ventricular hypertrophy which was probably due to mild hpertension; usually 140/90 in the dr. office and 120/75 at home. I visited my internist who visits where i live every 4 months and gave a copy my report from the cardiologist. He did an ekg and said it showed no signs of hypertrophy and my report was essentially normal. The only other thing that was mentioned in the report was that I had no frank mitral valve prolapse; but that there was a redundant pattern of motion of the mitral leaflets. My question to you; do you think the hpertrophy that I have is of any clinical signifance or if i should get an repeat echo in another year and do you thinks the redundant motion of the mitral leaflets could suggest a mild mitral valve prolapse as i do present with most of its symptoms.

606,Atenolol+hypertension,Dr. Mark; Can you tell me what the symptoms are of Pheochromocytoma? My endo said that if my symptoms don't improve within two weeks we'd look into my hyperthyroid symptoms more to see if something else was going on (I'm on methimazole and atenolol). I have a lot of symptoms that coincide with pheochromocytoma; however; my b/p is 80/60 on the atenolol; and the only headaches I get are the everyday headaches.

607,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have noticed recently (over the past few months) that I have been acting oddly. First of all; I find myself having to urinate frequently. This usually occurs during school but sometimes in the evening as well. It is not everyday that I feel like this. Yesterday; for example; I had to urinate 9 times between 8:30 am and 3:30 pm; however; today; I only had to urinate 3 times. In addition; I think that I have become increasingly moody; but; to be perfectly honest; I have always been known for my moodiness; so its a little bit hard to tell; lol. Now; today I went to the doctor to check up on my high blood pressure; which I seem to be doing more and more these days. She had me do a urine test; which came back as very high in sugar (I didn't ask what the number was.) When she pricked my finger; however; my blood sugar was low; 67; I believe. My doctor said that the urinalysis must have been inaccurate; but; given my symptoms; I am not so sure. Is it possible for me to be diabetic and just expel massive amounts of sugar through my urine? Oh; I almost forgot; I can feel when my blood sugar is low; and it doesn't happen very often. I could definitely feel that it was low when the nurse pricked my finger. Do you think that I should just ignore it or what? A few other odd symptoms: I randomly will find that a toe; finger; or maybe even a whole hand will become completely cold. It is like it is not even part of my body. It isn't numb; just cold. The feeling typically goes away after a while. I am noticing red; splotchy stops; especially on the front of my ankles. Is this related? Finally; I have felt tired a lot lately. Is this a part of it? Now I take atenolol; which is a beta blocker; for my hypertension. I am not sure how much of this is related to that.

608,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Doc; Maybe you can give me a clue as to why I'm having these. Last night I opened my eyes at 4 am and saw something similar to a Jackson Pollack's painting. Little squiggles and lines; all moving and changing shape. When I closed my eyes I still saw these but in shades of gray! They lasted for several minutes and dissappeared. I've had night time hallucinations for over 10 years now; sometimes I see complex patterns; like mosaics or tiles changing colors or shapes. A few times I saw hazy snow like a bad tv reception. Are these migraine auras or what? I am a 53 yo female; on meds for hypertension and diabetes. Hx of migraine.

610,Atenolol+hypertension,Two part medical questions : I have been treated for high blood pressure for last 15 years (was taking Atenolol-50 mg & Lisinopril-30mg). Recently; I was diagnosed with palpitations (PVC's) by a Cardiologist. (via EKG test) I was directed by this physician to start taking Atenolol (100MG) and Lisinopril (40MG) as treatment for the PVC condition. Assumption is that by lowering my BP it will eliminate or better control the PVC events. Does this sound appropriate? Since I'm very nervous and apprehensive when these PVC events occur (which probably drives up my PB even more!); would the additional use of Ativan (.05mg) or Celexa (20mg) help calm me while I deal with these conditions .... or would they conflict with current Hypertension medication?

611,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello all My doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 40mg when my blood pressure was 170/105 at hospital about 6 months ago. I had dizziness (electricity going through my brain feeling) and fatigue; hard time breathing before the doctor's visit; but even after the medication; the symptoms continued. But; my blood pressure was regulated to around 110/80. Then; slowly; my blood pressure started coming down even more to 100/80; 90/70; then 80/60. So Doctor told me to take only 20mg of lisinopril every day. I did. Then; even more serious headaches; dizziness; and feeling like fainting; and high blood pressure. So Doctor then prescribed Atenolol 25mg per day. One week of trial. Even higher blood pressure around 170/110. So Doctor then advised that I should take both Lisinopril 30mg in the morning; and Atenolol 25mg at night. This has been working quite well for few weeks; bringing my blood pressure to 100/60 almost every time I measured it. But; recently; I started having those peak moments where I would start freezing/trembling; severe headaches/dizziness; and my legs had no strength that I fell few times. My arms/hands felt like there was no circulation; that I coudnt even hold a drug bottle. Blood pressure around 165/110. Then; I took Xanax. This helped almost every time I had this happened to me. But; these days; those happenings where I would have crazy dizziness and weakness in all my body and my blood pressure going up skyhigh come to me more often. Everytime I take Xanax; it does help; but only temporarily. Doctor tells me that I am having panic/anxiety attacks; and the medications actually do work; because all that matters is the average blood pressure; not just few incidents per week. I feel like there must be some other hypertension medication out there that should get rid of these symptoms and get my blood pressure stable. Because when it's stable; I feel OK. These days; not. I have high blood pressure very often even with the medications... not the anxiety attacks... I don't know what to do. Doc tells me to stop worrying and keep my current meds; but I want to change them.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,,,hello My doctor prescrib lisinopril 40mg blood pressur 170105 hospit 6 month ago I dizzi electr go brain feel fatigu hard time breath doctor visit even medic symptom continu but blood pressur regul around 11080 then slowli blood pressur start come even 10080 9070 8060 So doctor told take 20mg lisinopril everi day I then even seriou headach dizzi feel like faint high blood pressur So doctor prescrib atenolol 25mg per day one week trial even higher blood pressur around 170110 So doctor advis I take lisinopril 30mg morn atenolol 25mg night thi work quit well week bring blood pressur 10060 almost everi time I measur but recent I start peak moment I would start freezingtrembl sever headachesdizzi leg strength I fell time My armshand felt like circul I coudnt even hold drug bottl blood pressur around 165110 then I took xanax thi help almost everi time I happen but day happen I would crazi dizzi weak bodi blood pressur go skyhigh come often everytim I take xanax help temporarili doctor tell I panicanxieti attack medic actual work matter averag blood pressur incid per week I feel like must hypertens medic get rid symptom get blood pressur stabl becaus stabl I feel OK these day I high blood pressur often even medic anxieti attack I dont know doc tell stop worri keep current med I want chang

Oh and I had a heart cath in Oct 2008 all okay; but he did mention an S4 but said it would go away when the pressure comes down. He said; ""this will pass"" and I asked him ""before I do""; he didn't seem concerned. He is one of the best in NYS. Can anybody give me some reassurance?

613,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am 48 yr old male with Juvenile onset Diabetis. About 6 months ago I had a brief spell of a-fib that caused a chain reaction of doctor visits; cariologist visits; tests that all came out normal. My cardiologist put me on metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice per day. Although he told me it was a benign drug I have many side effects including fatigue and drowsiness; some dizzyness; and loss of sex drive and ED problems. The side effects were really hampering my ability to function throughout the day. About 3 weeks ago i tapered off metoprolol of which my last dose was 1 1/2 weeks ago. everything went fine but now am having issues with blood pressure spikes; chest pains. tachy-cardia spells and dizzyness. I really feel crummy. My thinking was that I was having withdrawls from not taking metoprolol but why the symptoms after almost two weeks from taking it? I am tempted to go back on the drug to alleviate these symptoms as they are kind scary. I do not want to be on this drug and feel there is no need for it. I have mild hypertension and proir to metoprolol was taking low dose of lisinopril which I am back on now.,2013,2013,,Male,,,hello I 48 yr old male juvenil onset diabeti about 6 month ago I brief spell afib caus chain reaction doctor visit cariologist visit test came normal My cardiologist put metoprolol tartrat 25mg twice per day although told benign drug I mani side effect includ fatigu drowsi dizzy loss sex drive ED problem the side effect realli hamper abil function throughout day about 3 week ago taper metoprolol last dose 1 12 week ago everyth went fine issu blood pressur spike chest pain tachycardia spell dizzy I realli feel crummi My think I withdrawl take metoprolol symptom almost two week take I tempt go back drug allevi symptom kind scari I want drug feel need I mild hypertens proir metoprolol take low dose lisinopril I back

616,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

617,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 43 year old male; and have been on atenolol and lotensin for 7-8 years for hypertension and nagging PACs. Two years ago at my cardiologist's recommendation; I began taking 40 mg of Zokor (I have recently reduced it to 20 mg/day) since I have gotten regular readings of total cholesterol at 200-230; HDL 29-45; LDL 140-170. There is a history of heart attack on my mother's side (herself at 48 and her father at 39 years old). Tests from holter monitors; treadmills and echos indicate no signs of CHD in me yet. I am considering stopping the Zokor even though it is doing the job; because I swear it is causing my hair to fall out which is a big deal to me since I have always had a lot of it. My cardiologist says Zokor isn't the likely culprit. My question is this: Could Zokor and/or the other two drugs be contributing to the sudden thinning; and would it do any good to switch to a non-statin? I really hate taking so many medications.,1999,1999,,,,,Im 43 year old male atenolol lotensin 78 year hypertens nag pac two year ago cardiologist recommend I began take 40 mg zokor I recent reduc 20 mgday sinc I gotten regular read total cholesterol 200230 hdl 2945 ldl 140170 there histori heart attack mother side 48 father 39 year old test holter monitor treadmil echo indic sign chd yet I consid stop zokor even though job I swear caus hair fall big deal sinc I alway lot My cardiologist say zokor isnt like culprit My question could zokor andor two drug contribut sudden thin would good switch nonstatin I realli hate take mani medic
618,Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping you will give me an opinion on this. I have had a lot of symptoms over the years that now suggest that I could possibly have Behcet's disease. I have an appointment with the rheumatologist I saw for similar problems (about 10 years) in February. I am a 49 year old premenopausal (as far as I know; tested last January) female; with a not so great lipid picture(TC 216 after much effort; LDL 145; HDL 26; Trig 225). My weight is normal; don't smoke; take 25mg atenolol daily for mild hypertension. Lately I have noticed what I believe could be angina symptoms and this has me concerned. When I walk uphill I get chest discomfort that goes into my neck and sometimes my left shoulder. If I slow down or walk on even ground it goes away. It never happens any other time (such as under stressful situations)and always happens when I walk uphill (although sometimes worse than other times) I joined a fitness program about a year ago (had to stop because I developed sacroiliac problems but I do walk 2 miles 4-5 times per week)where I had what was called a submaximal multilevel treadmill stress test. These angina symptoms did not happen during this test; which was declared normal. My question is that I have read that vasculitis of the coronary arteries can cause symptoms similar to angina symptoms. Since Behcet's disease is a vasculitis type disease; often with episodes coming and going intermittently; I am wondering if that could possibly be causing my symptoms that resemble angina. If so; does this still mean that the coronary arteries are not getting enough oxygen; or would angina symptoms from vasculitis not mean the same as angina symptoms from CAD? Thank you for your opinion. As I said; I have an appt with the rheumatologist and plan to discuss this with him.

619,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Physicians at Cleveland Heart Clinic; Is it unlikely to have angina like symptoms only at rest and never while jogging/running daily?

622,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I was recently diagnosed with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism and have been on Levoxyl(or something like it initially LOL) for over a month. Interestingly; my average blood pressure reading has significantly declined latley. It was borderline; 130's (sometimnes 140's) over 90's for last few years; but have now been getting readings in the 100's (systolic) with diastolic readings in the upper 60's. Last echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction and had me wondering if the thyroid replacement is causing the BP to fall? Is it possible the diastolic function will show improvement now? I have always been active; exercise-wise; but have recently also started to be even more active. Maybe it's because of that?

All kidney blood test have come back normal & no signs of diabetes. The Endocrinologist sent me back to my doctor; neither of which has ordered any more test or changed any meds. Basically endocrinologist is done w/me & my doctor said she’ll see me at my check up in March.

Results form 12/07 MRI---LV & RV mildly dilated normal systolic function; RA&LA moderately dilated; valves---no change; no change in anuerysm; EF 50%. Recent tests---BP 105/65; HR 55; Cholest: 121; HDL 40 ; LDL 62; Trig 92. I feel great; no shortness of breath; speed walk up and down hills 4 miles daily. Take Atacand 24 mg; Vytorin 10/20; Atenolol 25 mg. Question: My general MD says that the atriums are probably the size of my natural heart. this is not consistent with previous studies----can you explain the increase in atrium size---possible mis reading of MRI? Am i at risk? what can i do to reduce the enlargement? I worry about these things! Should i see my cardiologist? Previous CATS; EKG; and Stress (all w/i a 18 mos) no evidence of dialtin of atrium. I would appreciate your thoughts on this as i can not find a reason for the enlargement based on my searches.

627,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia and suffer from aniety/panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG. Not sure if this plays any part in thyroid issues as well. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!,2008,2010,,Female,,,Hi I 34 yo femal suspect I may thyroid problem I ER sever time recent chest pain new Dx hypertens atenolol tachycardia suffer anietypan attack I great shape work 23 timeswk tgchol normal dont smoke rare drink alcohol I mention primari Dr possibl thyroid problem order bloodwork consist T4 total 72 tsh 099 I know number within normal rang shouldnt I test like free T3 free T4 thyroid antibodi Is possibl RO thyroid problem test T4 total tsh also test I recent done show elev RF high igg not sure play part thyroid issu well ani feedback greatli appreci
628,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 38 year old female and have always had blood pressure of 117/74 or lower. The odd time it would be 120/80 but this was rare. For the last 4 days i've checked my pressure and it has been on average 129/76 (i check it very regularly at the drug store). I've very concerned that it is this high so quickly. I've always battled my weight and am currently on the Weight Watchers program. I don't smoke; don't drink and really don't have alot of stress in my life. I had a stress test approximately 4 months ago and received the highest possible score of 7+ minutes walking at a fast speed. Is this something I should notify my Dr. about? What could cause bp to raise to such a high level in such a short time and stay there?

629,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP & heart rate; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. After having the baby I went to the new PCP again I've been seeing; and he did another EKG (Feb. '09). This time the EKG read non specific abnormalities in leads V4-V6... normal sinus rythym 90 BPM. The dcotor said the EKG was abnormal & I needed to see a cardiologist. How could the EKG's differe so quickly? What do the results mean?,2007,2009,,Female,,,I 28 year old femal mother 2 young kid after labor deliveri first child 6 year ago I develop high BP seem faster heartbeat I kind anxiou person I attribut heartbeat I went pcp BP diagnos anxieti relat hypertens didnt think I need see cardiologist So I took atenolol switch toprol XL control BP heart rate seem I ekg 03 normal I told fast forward 2008 I found I pregnant 2nd child the obgyn I see put labetalol never refer cardiologist after deliveri babi I csection I lost lot blood OB doctor wouldnt give BP med day BP low while hospit heart rate got 144 one point I recent went new pcp old one left practic new one put back toprol XL hed perform ekg 08 I pregnant normal after babi I went new pcp ive see anoth ekg feb 09 thi time ekg read non specif abnorm lead v4v6 normal sinu rythym 90 bpm the dcotor said ekg abnorm I need see cardiologist how could ekg differ quickli what result mean

631,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking 25 mg of metoprolo a day (1/2 pill twice daily) just for some minor issues with PVCs. After several months I got hives and some food sensitivity that is evidently a side effect; so I decided to stop. My cardiologist seemed to think this is a low enough dose that I could just stop cold if I wanted to; but I thought I'd see what folks thought; if I should taper off.,2008,2012,,,,,ive take 25 mg metoprolo day 12 pill twice daili minor issu pvc after sever month I got hive food sensit evid side effect I decid stop My cardiologist seem think low enough dose I could stop cold I want I thought Id see folk thought I taper
632,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 68 year old lady in formerly good health but now suffer from PAF which is increasing to the point where I had a four day stay in hospital a few months ago;but it then reverted on its own. Now I get approx a 3-4 hour episode every few weeks. I also take Valsartin for hypertension(Co-Diovan 12.5) for a number of years and this is successful. I was previously taking Atenolol for this; but was put on 10 mg daily Bisoprolol in the hospital; also placed on a Warfarin program. Some six weeks later I was taken off the Warfarin and put on a low dose daily aspirin. I wore a Novocor monitor for a week which showed transient AF but also bradycardia (about 42bmp) and the specialist recommended a possible pacemaker for this in the future. As my episodes increase; I have questioned such a high dose of Bisoprolol which I read can slow the heartbeat; ie one drug to slow the heartbeat and a pacemaker to speed it up? I had not been aware of any bradycardia prior to all this; but then I was undiagnosed with any brewing heart problems for several years I think. My surgery doctor has decreased the Bisoprolol to 7.5 and says we will wait to see the effect. My question is really about the suitability of Bisoprolol for my condition. Here in England they never mention ablation or any of the suggestions I read of in US sites. I just would like to know the sensible way forward and the way to self-help. In between attacks I feel fit and well; though tired for a couple of days afterwards. During; I often feel lightheaded.

634,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everyone I thought about a million ways to write my problem to be easy on the eyes; so I'll begin by my status. I Live in: São Paulo; Brazil (fairly Tropical weather) Gender: Male Age: 22 Weight: 154 pounds Height: 5' feet 7' Drink? No Smoke? No Exercise? Yes; regularly. 1st year medical student (started in UK going to finish in Brazil) Sexual Orientation: Straight Eating habits back in 2005: Junk food and regularly white rice with meat Eating habits back in 2006: Vegetarian (consumed fish) Eating habits back in 2007: Lesser junk food back to eat meat with white rice Eating habits back in 2008 to present: Vegetarian again but now I do not consume any rice at all; just more vegetables Take Any Medications? Yes; 25mg of Atenolol daily (began to take it in 2006) Hypochondriac? No Stressed? No Brazil has an outbreak for Yellow fever; Malaria and Dengue; but its not common in my city or its surroundings at all and I do not have it. Symptoms I am currently experiencing (with their respective year of discovery): - Hypertension (2006) - Hair loss everywhere in my body; but the top of my head was affected the most (2005 and I'm almost bald on top of my head) - Gall stones (2006) - Moderate Gastritis (2006) - Hepatic Steatosis (I do not drink any alcohol at all) (2006) - Bloating after eating (2005) - Sometimes I get diarrhea with very strong pain in the lower GI; right below the belly button (2005) - White Rice and junk food gives me cramps with diarrhea (present) Important exams I did: * Cholesterol: 20mg/dL LDL (Yes; I know; 20MG/DL LDL; how is that even possible!!) (2007) * HIV: Negative (december 2008) <- This was my greatest fear I'm glad I ruled that out * Hepatitis A: Negative (december 2008) * Hepatitis B: Negative (december 2008) * Hepatitis C: Negative (december 2008) * Rubeola or Measles: Negative and Immune (december 2008) * Toxoplasmosis: IgG 58.10 IU/mL / IgM 0.0 IU/mL (december 2008) * EKG: Normal (2006; 2007; 2008) * MRI of the neck down: Normal (2007) * Chest X-Rays: Normal(2006) * Ultrasound of the heart and other organs: Normal except for the abnormal finding of Hepatic Steatosis. (2006) * CBC (Geez; I did SO MANY CBCs that I lost track but every single one came out to be normal) (2005; 2006; 2007; 2008) * Colonoscopy: Small benign polyp was found and quickly removed; no other findings. (2006) * Vitamins levels: normal (2007) * Urine: Normal (Geez; I also did countless of of urine exam; so many kinds that I dont even remember anymore; even had to pee all day on a jar once) (2006) * Testosterone levels (total): 739.7 ng/dL (Normal: 241.0 to 827.0 ng/dL) * LH: 3.0 mUI/mL * ACTH hormone: 16.3 pg/mL (Normal: 0.0 to 46.0 pg/mL) * Prolactin: 7.5 ng/mL (Normal: 2.1 to 17.7 ng/mL) * Plasmatic Cortisol: Normal * Cardiac Enzymes: Normal * Thyroid exams (TSH; T4; etc; etc): NORMAL * Thousands of other exams that I already forgot: Normal * Glucoses: Normal levels (2005/06/07/08) * Endoscopy: Moderate Gastritis (2006/07) For a few months back in 2006 I suffered with bloody diarrhea; the blood was quite red and fresh; which indicated lower GI bleeding. That was the reason why I did a colonoscopy in the first place; no abnormalities were found at all besides a small benign polyp which was removed and analysed and determined benign. I am a very relaxed person; I do not suffer from any form at stress at all. Strangest part?! I share the same symptoms with my Father; my Brother and My cousin family. They all started to suffer from Gastro-Intestinal Disturbances / Hypertension / Hair loss; exactly like me. And around the same time as I started. And when I say gastro intestinal disturbances I mean so severe that once I was rushed into the ER with a very staggering pain in the lower GI (below the belly button); I felt as if I was getting stabbed with a knife (from 0 to 10 I'd say 9.5; the pain level); the pain did not go away and the doctors thought I had apendicitis at the time; I did an MRI from the neck down and it revealed that everything was normal; so I was discharged without any treatment besides Buscopan. Because my close relatives suffer from the same symptom I assumed it was infectious; but the CBC ruled that out. I am going to perform an exam this wednesday to check whether or not I am poisoned with a metal compound such as Barium (my town had a case of barium contamination in a place near the water supply). Been a few months that I been exercising regularly; it didn't change much besides slowing my heart rate. But I still feel palpitations which are VERY annoying; especially after I eat something. I dont even need to say that I been o thousands of doctors; right? And did THOUSANDS of exams to try to find a cause for my hypertension and NOTHING. I've been told I was Hypochondriac and that my symptoms are related to stress; and quite frankly I am very tired of hearing such a thing. My story is simply: One day I was normal the next I was shitting blood; loosing hair and hypertensive. I was not stressed or depressed before or after it happened and I still am not. Do I feel incredibly thirsty? Not presently; but when I use to consume junk food back in 2006 yes; I did and quite regularly. My forehead is very oilish; which indicates liver problems. My LDL cholesterol is very low which indicates liver problem. Did I do Liver Biopsy? No doctors ordered it; so; no. Did I loose or gained weight? My weight has always been around 154 pounds; I do not get any more fatter nor skinnier. Did I have fever? Maybe not; I might have felt a little warm but not in a concerning level so I didnt even check. Do I still suffer from bloody diarrhea? Not bloody anymore; but I still suffer from diarrhea when I eat certain foods such as rice or junk food. My Hairloss is so weird that whenever I clean my room I find hair from my legs; arms; and in massive amounts; they just come out. When I have to remove hair from my nose I dont even feel pain; it just comes out as if it was loosen up there. I been SUFFERING with these problems since 2005; came around to really know them in 2006. Perhaps that if it was only me who had those symptoms I would feel hypochondriac indeed; but my brother; my father and my cousin family (two females and one male) are experiecing the exact same symptoms. Now I am trying to find a fellow doctor who would be kind into analyzing my case and not just dismissing me as a hypochondriac or stressed. Thanks if you took the time to read this; I appreciate; I put some effort into writing it because I wanted to know if anybody could help me and not just dismiss me as a hypochondriac.,2009,2009,,,,,hello everyon I thought million way write problem easi eye ill begin statu I live So paulo brazil fairli tropic weather gender male age 22 weight 154 pound height 5 feet 7 drink No smoke No exercis ye regularli 1st year medic student start UK go finish brazil sexual orient straight eat habit back 2005 junk food regularli white rice meat eat habit back 2006 vegetarian consum fish eat habit back 2007 lesser junk food back eat meat white rice eat habit back 2008 present vegetarian I consum rice veget take ani medic ye 25mg atenolol daili began take 2006 hypochondriac No stress No brazil outbreak yellow fever malaria dengu common citi surround I symptom I current experienc respect year discoveri hypertens 2006 hair loss everywher bodi top head affect 2005 Im almost bald top head gall stone 2006 moder gastriti 2006 hepat steatosi I drink alcohol 2006 bloat eat 2005 sometim I get diarrhea strong pain lower GI right belli button 2005 white rice junk food give cramp diarrhea present import exam I cholesterol 20mgdl ldl ye I know 20mgdl ldl even possibl 2007 hiv neg decemb 2008 thi greatest fear Im glad I rule hepat A neg decemb 2008 hepat B neg decemb 2008 hepat C neg decemb 2008 rubeola measl neg immun decemb 2008 toxoplasmosi igg 5810 iuml igm 00 iuml decemb 2008 ekg normal 2006 2007 2008 mri neck normal 2007 chest xray normal2006 ultrasound heart organ normal except abnorm find hepat steatosi 2006 cbc geez I SO mani cbc I lost track everi singl one came normal 2005 2006 2007 2008 colonoscopi small benign polyp found quickli remov find 2006 vitamin level normal 2007 urin normal geez I also countless urin exam mani kind I dont even rememb anymor even pee day jar 2006 testosteron level total 7397 ngdl normal 2410 8270 ngdl LH 30 muiml acth hormon 163 pgml normal 00 460 pgml prolactin 75 ngml normal 21 177 ngml plasmat cortisol normal cardiac enzym normal thyroid exam tsh T4 etc etc normal thousand exam I alreadi forgot normal glucos normal level 2005060708 endoscopi moder gastriti 200607 for month back 2006 I suffer bloodi diarrhea blood quit red fresh indic lower GI bleed that reason I colonoscopi first place abnorm found besid small benign polyp remov analys determin benign I relax person I suffer form stress strangest part I share symptom father brother My cousin famili they start suffer gastrointestin disturb hypertens hair loss exactli like and around time I start and I say gastro intestin disturb I mean sever I rush ER stagger pain lower GI belli button I felt I get stab knife 0 10 Id say 95 pain level pain go away doctor thought I apend time I mri neck reveal everyth normal I discharg without treatment besid buscopan becaus close rel suffer symptom I assum infecti cbc rule I go perform exam wednesday check whether I poison metal compound barium town case barium contamin place near water suppli been month I exercis regularli didnt chang much besid slow heart rate but I still feel palpit veri annoy especi I eat someth I dont even need say I thousand doctor right and thousand exam tri find caus hypertens noth ive told I hypochondriac symptom relat stress quit frankli I tire hear thing My stori simpli one day I normal next I shit blood loos hair hypertens I stress depress happen I still Do I feel incred thirsti not present I use consum junk food back 2006 ye I quit regularli My forehead oilish indic liver problem My ldl cholesterol low indic liver problem did I liver biopsi No doctor order did I loos gain weight My weight alway around 154 pound I get fatter skinnier did I fever mayb I might felt littl warm concern level I didnt even check Do I still suffer bloodi diarrhea not bloodi anymor I still suffer diarrhea I eat certain food rice junk food My hairloss weird whenev I clean room I find hair leg arm massiv amount come when I remov hair nose I dont even feel pain come loosen I suffer problem sinc 2005 came around realli know 2006 perhap symptom I would feel hypochondriac inde brother father cousin famili two femal one male experiec exact symptom now I tri find fellow doctor would kind analyz case dismiss hypochondriac stress thank took time read I appreci I put effort write I want know anybodi could help dismiss hypochondriac
635,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 59 year old male. Past medical history of controlled hypertension and cervical fusion C5-7 in 2004 for spinal stenosis. I was doing fine until about 7 months ago. My house was being painted and the painters used a very strong smelling lacquer on the woodwork. I have no idea if this has anything to do with the problem; but it coincided with the onset of my symptoms. I developed vertigo. I was first diagnosed with BPPV and sent for Epley maneuvers. When these didn't help; I underwent a video nystagmogram which was read as normal. The symptoms persisted along with intermittent headaches. General lab work including workup for autoimmune disease was negative as were MRIs of the brain and neck and carotid dopplers. A neurosurgeon recommended a epidural steroid injection which relieved the headaches as well as some visual problems I was having; but had no effect on the vertigo. Actually; the vertigo morphed into more of a feeling of dizziness with my head swimming. There was no nausea or vomiting. Another ENT suggested vestibular migraine; but the addition of nortriptyline did nothing. Lying flat my symptoms are almost gone. Sitting up my head spins but I can tolerate the symptoms. However; standing and walking are intolerable. I was off work for a few months but after some vestibular rehab; I have returned with limited success. I've also tried acupuncture and gentle cervical manipulation without success. I fear I will have to retire. No days are good; but some are worse than others. Somedays I have headaches; others I do not. My meds are unchanged and include Losartan; atenolol; HCTZ; and Simvastatin.

636,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 31 year old male and I was recently prescribed Adderall IR 10mg for ADD. The Psychiatrist told me to take two pills a day; as each pill gets out of your system within/around 4 hours. I noticed upon taking the first pill on the first day around 9am; I didn't feel it wearing off until the early evening; so I wasn't about to take another. Although the ""wearing off"" made me feel exhausted and the same feeling on the second day. Today is the third day and I took the pill around 8:30 this morning and felt the effects dwindling about an hour ago. I'm just curious--I'm assuming there is some sort of period where your body has to get used to the Adderall? Not like building up a tolerance to it necessarily; but your body simply adjusting to the new medication? It's weird too because I do have a bit of anxiety without the Adderall; but with the Adderall there is still some nervous energy there; but it feels more focused. Like the anxiety is attempting to rear its ugly head but I'm able to keep it at bay a little better. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Also; I was concerned that my BP jumped up a few points when I started taking it and I hope that will normalize a bit as well. I take Atenolol 50mg for hypertension; and it hangs around 125-130 over 80 most days. With the Adderall; I can see the systolic number getting just under 140 with the diastolic number sometimes hitting 85-90.

637,Atenolol+hypertension,"Dear Dr. History: I am a 49 yr old F; not over wt.; don't smoke or drink. Am more or less sedentary. I have mild MVP; w/mild MR and TR. I am being treated for IST and NCS. I am on 81 mg. of aspirin for Factor V Leiden; I have Raynaud's and misc diag. Meds: verapamil;atenolol; misc. My mother had a double bypass and MVR and yrs later died of CHF at 75. Her sister died of a ""weak heart"" after giving birth to a ""blue baby"" at around 30; her bro. died at 42 from a stroke. Mom and Dad had emphysema late in life and never smoked. I don't know if any of that is relevant. My last echo 2-3 yrs. ago said ""mildly elev. pulmonary pressure"". My ? is; all the other echoes had TR; but never mentioned this. What are the chances I really have it? Could this be incorrect? My new PCP wants to do another echo to see if it's chg'd and maybe send me to a pulmonologist. What do you think? (In the past I've been told my lips were purple. I get sob w/o the tachy). What tests should be done? When/Should I see a pulmary dr. or ph spec.? The other ? is about vague heart attack symptoms; chest pain. I went to the ER 2-3 yrs ago and they thought I was having a heart attack. I had L. upper back; neck; and arm pain and coincidental EKG chgs. It would feel better when standing.It was C-spine prob.

638,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 31 yr old female with a long history of arrhythmia problems. I wear a pacemaker after repeated EP studies and ablation failed to correct my problem with atrial tachycardias. I am writing because I believe I have received more bad news. I very recently had an echo which showed that I had some enlargement of my right atria and ventricle; along with moderate tricuspid insuffiency. I also have been determined to have mild pulmonary hypertension. All of these findings are new; I have never had them before until now. The report says my RV systolic pressure is 33mm above my RA pressure. I have been trying to understand what these numbers mean. However; overall; I have not heard good things about pulmonary hypertension. I also because of my condition am 100% dependent on my pacemaker for my life and I am concerned that the leads could be contributing to the problem. I actually have 3 leads--one atrial and two ventricular--one is a lead from a past pacer that caused me serious problems. The lead was not compatible with my upgraded machine which has two wires. Now I have this third wire in there just hanging around. I am also despondent about why my physician's office never told me about these results. (This is not the first time; however; delays for abnormal results have been stashed away in a chart unbenounced to the patient). Because I didn't get notified; I am really not sure what to think. Is this important? It doesn't seem that way to my doctor's office. Thanks for any feedback you can give me here.,2002,2002,,,,,hello I 31 yr old femal long histori arrhythmia problem I wear pacemak repeat EP studi ablat fail correct problem atrial tachycardia I write I believ I receiv bad news I recent echo show I enlarg right atria ventricl along moder tricuspid insuffi I also determin mild pulmonari hypertens all find new I never the report say RV systol pressur 33mm RA pressur I tri understand number mean howev overal I heard good thing pulmonari hypertens I also condit 100 depend pacemak life I concern lead could contribut problem I actual 3 leadson atrial two ventricularon lead past pacer caus seriou problem the lead compat upgrad machin two wire now I third wire hang around I also despond physician offic never told result thi first time howev delay abnorm result stash away chart unbenounc patient becaus I didnt get notifi I realli sure think Is import It doesnt seem way doctor offic thank feedback give
639,Atenolol+hypertension,I was placed on Atenolol 50mg once a day by my doctor when my BP was 140/90. I used it for about one month but went back to the doctor when it gave me terrible headaches and back ache. So I was told to switch to Aldactone 25mg. After 2 weeks of using the Aldactone; my BP got back to 120/80 for the next one month after taking the Aldactone. Meanwhile; my eye doctor gave me Diamox and Slow-K for one week in the last of my taking Aldactone.My doctor asked me to stop the drug 6 days ago since my BP is back to normal. However; I have been experiencing numbness in the right side of my body (from head to toe!) and especially at night and/or when I lie down or am asleep. I wake up in the night to ease myself and am notice the numbness and fear grips me. For 2 nights; I have trembled uncontrollably on that same right side of my body At times I feel breathless and my chest feels tight. Most worrisome is the fuzzy feeling in the right side of my head that I try to ignore all day. Please; what's happening? Are these side effects of stopping the Aldactone? Am a 41 -year old woman.

640,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks",2008,2008,,,,,hello Dr I 33 year old male hypertens bicuspid aorta for year I great deal health anxieti manifest fast heart rate occasion palpit mayb arrythmia etc doctor believ anxieti play role hypertens I take 25mg atenolol 20mg lisinopril daili bp read avg 13085 My problem Im alway scare sudden death Im athlet I work 45 time week whenev I read athlet suddenli die heart relat problem Im sure also happen ive worn holter monitor get regular echo due bicuspid diagnosi stress echo event monitor theyv never realli found anyth stenosi cardiomyopathi etc So I feel pretti comfort structur heart fine wont caus problem I still worri electr problem would seen thing like brugada syndrom long QT syndrom recogn problem vagal tone etc should I ask see EP cardiologist well basic current symptom occasion flutter especi right I fall asleep occasion rapid heart rate feel weaker normal accompani sensat base neck carotid arteri vagu nerv for reason I shake fear thank

643,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello I'm 28 years old; male. I had a bout of atrial fib once a few months ago. I had it for maybe two or three hours. I think it was stress that caused it. It had been building up for a while. My ER doc. said he wasn't going to give me meds because I was young and would probably never have the problem again. I had an echocardiogram later in that month and everything was normal according to the report. Atria were normal size. Blood ejection volume was normal etc. I also had a heart event monitor which showed no atrial fib for the month after my episode. My GP doctor (not a heart specialist) said that he was happy with the results and decided not to do anything. I'm on 81mg of aspirin and also atenolol for high blood pressure. My cholestrol test are very good; and I have no diabetes. I am still very worried about stroke though. I have seen a lot of horror stories online about younger people having strokes. What is my risk for stroke? I don't think I've been in atrial fib since that one time. I'm also wondering how doctors decide what meds for clots to put you on? Is it age? and underlying heart disease? High Cholestrol? When is warfarin used and when is just aspirin used? Is 81 mg of aspirin enough for someone in my situation? Also if I have had atrial fib once in the past is it a good idea to get checked for it again? How often? These questions have been lingering in my head and I have had a lot of anxiety over them. Any answers would be great!

646,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth Anderson on February 26; 1998 at 01:45:04: I am a 47 year old female who is severely obese. I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart?

647,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had hypertension for several years and have trouble with side effects from meds. I have been taking Clonidine and Atenolol. Since taking the clonidine since March I have felt strange sensations in my chest and also gained 10 pounds in two weeks. I have been back to the Internal Medicine physician several times because of this. Last week as I was walking in the park up a steep hill; I became short of breath and dizzy. I had a hard time breathing. I went to the do again and he gave me Valturna in additon to the other drugs. The breathing problem continued where I could not catch my breath. On Sunday I felt this weird sensation in my body and again could not breath. The electrocardiogram showed extra beats and it was recommeded that I get a holter monitor. The results were pvc s and pac s. Knowing that I have a hard time with meds; he said just to continue the meds. Valturna 150 mg; clonidine 0.1 mg twice a day and Atenolol 25 mg twice daily. I feel like a zombie in the corner. Is it necessary to take this much medication. Also my bp was hard to control on the clonidine and Atenolol.

648,Atenolol+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post.

650,Atenolol+hypertension,I have fainted with almost no warning on 4 occasions over the last few months. In each case I have quickly regained consciousness without any lasting effects. On two occasions this occurred in public shortly after a meal; which scared my fellow diners. On the other two occasions it was at home; once in the bathroom; and the other while working at my computer. The pattern seems to be first a feeling of dizziness; I am sweating profusely and feeling generally unsteady. The onset in rapid and I black out completely within the next one to two minutes. On one occasion I was aware of tunnel vision a few seconds before fainting. I am told that I regain consciousness quite fast once I am on the floor; in any event enough to head off those around me from calling an ambulance. Although I can't know this from my own experience; I guess that we must be talking around 30 seconds of unconsciousness. When I come to at first I have no knowledge of where I am or how I got there. I am feeling quite contented with no pain. Full feeling and awareness quickly return; probably within one to two minutes; although I never actually remember the point of passing out. Once I have recovered I feel perfectly fine; no pain; no shortage of breath; normal heartbeat etc. The only symptom is a slight headache. On one occasion I took my blood pressure shortly afterwards. The reading was slightly low at 110/65. I take Atenolol for hypertension (v. effective). I am 47; male. I am concerned lest this is symptomatic of some kind of intermittent heart problem.,2002,2002,,,,,I faint almost warn 4 occas last month In case I quickli regain conscious without last effect On two occas occur public shortli meal scare fellow diner On two occas home bathroom work comput the pattern seem first feel dizzi I sweat profus feel gener unsteadi the onset rapid I black complet within next one two minut On one occas I awar tunnel vision second faint I told I regain conscious quit fast I floor event enough head around call ambul although I cant know experi I guess must talk around 30 second unconsci when I come first I knowledg I I got I feel quit content pain full feel awar quickli return probabl within one two minut although I never actual rememb point pass onc I recov I feel perfectli fine pain shortag breath normal heartbeat etc the symptom slight headach On one occas I took blood pressur shortli afterward the read slightli low 11065 I take atenolol hypertens v effect I 47 male I concern lest symptomat kind intermitt heart problem
651,Atenolol+hypertension,Going to Doc: please comment The left atrium was approaching the upper limits of normal size at 3.90 cm. The left ventricle is normal in size at 3.95 cm; with a systolic dimension of 3.90 cm. The left ventricle demonstrates moderate hypertrophy. The left ventricular wall; including the septum; altered its size and shape normally and moved appropriately in systole and diastole. There was no evidence of segmental wall motion abnormality. The estimated ejection fraction is 85%. The mitral valve shows mild annular calcification. The valvular leaflets appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or prolapse. Doppler studies of the mitral valve reveal evidence of trace mitral insufficiency; and the prominent A wave noted on Doppler inflow suggests decreased left ventriclular compliance. The right atrium and right ventricle; including inflow and outflow tracts; appeared normal. The aortic valve shows annular calcification with mile calcification of the aortic valve cusps. The valvular cusps appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or insufficiency. There is a measured transvalvular gradient of 6.11 mm of mercury across the valve; which is clinically insignificant for stenosis. The tricuspid and pulmonic valves were normal with evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency and mild pulmonic insufficiency on Doppler study. There were no vegetations seen on any valve. No intracavity masses or thrombi were noted. There was no evidence of pericardial infusion. Conclusion: Left atrial size approached the upper limits of normal. Normmal left ventricular chanber size with moderate concentric hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 85%. Mitral sclerosis with trace mitral insufficiency and a Doppler inflow pattern suggestive of decreased left ventricular compliance. Aortic sclerosis with no evidence of significant valvular dysfunction. Mild tricuspid insuffiency.

654,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my ?? I had an echo done nearly 5 years ago ; it showed only borderline hypertrophy; I had a echo done this past Tuesday which the cardio said had progressed from borderline to mild; a change of about 2mm if I remember correctly; B/P was 140/85 in the doc's office; at home every time I take it is always control around 115/70 most of the time. He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate.

655,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have ALWAYS had a rather low blood pressure; anywhere from 90/50 to 110/65; they used to not let me donate blood because the b/p would be too low. Of course; I was younger then. Now I am a 41 yr old woman. My family history includes everybody with high blood pressure. Lately I've not been feeling too well; I've had lots of periods of tachycardia and shortness of breath and PVCs as many as every other beat; but echo showed a normal heart so I am not to worry. However because of the continued chest pain with exercise that resolves with rest; a family history of heart disease; a new murmur heard at the exam; and continued mild tachycardia at rest; they decided to do a Cardiolite stress test and do a new echo....fully believing it to be nothing but just to be safe. The thing I don't understand is lately I've had periods of wide blood pressure elevation. Please note I have never had ""white coat hypertension"" before. Nonetheless my b/p has been 185/120; 175/110; 170/90 on at least three occasions in doctors offices. I have recorded it on several occasions at grocery stores in the neighborhood of 145-155 / 85-95 using the automatic blood pressure machines. By the same token; just as often it is 126-139 / 76-90. Is there any significance to this variability? The doctors have generally not commented on the pressure taken in their offices when it was so high except that once asked if I was nervous. Usually the nurse will say your blood pressure seems to be high today and then the doctor comes and looks at the chart and says nothing. For now I am assuming that since a good portion of the time it appears the blood pressure is within normal range; that means it is ok?

656,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 27 yo fem. with 2 kids. I'm fairly healthy; a mild asthmatic and problems with gaining/maintaining weight. After my son was born in '00; I began experiencing momentary dizziness. I had a holter monitor for 48 hrs; nothing weird showed up. I had my first syncope episode this summer; at a dance class. I had fallen and sprained my ankle; and 10 min later; I passed out. The squad was called and my pulse was irregular and my EKGs were abnormal. I went to the dr. the next day; they did another ekg; I showed sinus bradycardia. Normally not an issue but I had passed out. Plus; I'm not in great shape. I take 1 hr of dance a week (aerobic exercise) and that's all; and for both my pregnancies I was confined to bed for preterm labor for 4 and 7 months respectively. They did a tilt table test; It was neg; but as the meds wore off I did note that I skipped/paused my heartrate a lot. Since that first syncope episode I've had 4-5 episodes of near syncope. I've not had a fully normal ekg since then either. It either shows sinus tachy; sinus brady or sinus arrhythmia. All of these combined have me puzzled. I've been tested for so much because of my weight issues; and the first dr. I saw was just convinced I stood up too fast when I passed out (even though I was sitting with my feet elevated) I see a new cardiologist in 3 weeks; but is there anything I should ask them about? I think an event monitor is the next course of action; but does this sound typical of anything?

660,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been getting runs of bigeminys lasting up to an hour all day long. They will start with a hard skip and continue. I do get a break in between; but lasting no more than half an hour. This has been going on for a month. My cardiologist wants to put me on tambacor; .50mg twice a day. I'm a little afraid to go on that pill. What is your opinion of tambacor? I take atenolol now; .50mg a day ( cut in half twice a day.) Also I take avapro 150mg daily. Also I take synthroid .112mg. Atenolol does nothing for me but slow my heart down. I have been plagued with heart skips for 20 years. Been through every test possible; and tried everything possible. Nothing works. I know I can't continue this way. It is leaving me paralyzed with fear. Any suggestions? Do you think I could wean myself off of the atenolol? I have been taking it for many years. Ablation is out; too many horror stories about that. Do you think the slow heart beat (56 to 62) could be a culprit? I just want my life back; I'm so depressed. Thanks for listening.

661,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at?

663,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 30 year old female. Since June of this year; I have been experiencing a rapid heart beat. The first time it hapeened I was in bed sleeping!! but it usually occurrs after eating. My heart rate goes anywhere between 100 - 130 bpm and stays there sometimes for a couple hours. I've had an echo done; which was normal (right ventricle was not well visualized; however); ekgs; blood work and an event monitor that I wore for 21 days. My doctor says its not a rythym problem. Possibly anxiety. I take xanax .5 milligrams 2x a day. I have a prescription for a beta blocker; but i havent filled it yet. I dont like taking meds much. I have a family history of heart attacks (maternal grandmother) and my mother has a history of MVP (although she recently got an echo done which did not show MVP and her cardiologist said that the criteria for MVP has changed) so now she's not sure whether she has it; but for years she was told she did. Anyway; my questions are: 1) What is the difference between sinus tach and SVT? would they show up differently on an EKG? 2) How fast is too fast for a heart rate? 3) although my echo was normal; my doctor hears a click when he listens to my heart. if echo was normal; what could the click be from?? 4) kind of off fast heartrates; but I also have a pounding in my chest when standing to quickly or stretching; not like a fast beat; more like a slow; hard beat that lasts for a couple seconds. Is this normal? sorry this post is so long. I'm kind of obsessing over my heart these days. thanks.,2003,2003,,,,,Hi Im 30 year old femal sinc june year I experienc rapid heart beat the first time hapeen I bed sleep usual occurr eat My heart rate goe anywher 100 130 bpm stay sometim coupl hour ive echo done normal right ventricl well visual howev ekg blood work event monitor I wore 21 day My doctor say rythym problem possibl anxieti I take xanax 5 milligram 2x day I prescript beta blocker havent fill yet I dont like take med much I famili histori heart attack matern grandmoth mother histori mvp although recent got echo done show mvp cardiologist said criteria mvp chang she sure whether year told anyway question 1 what differ sinu tach svt would show differ ekg 2 how fast fast heart rate 3 although echo normal doctor hear click listen heart echo normal could click 4 kind fast heartrat I also pound chest stand quickli stretch like fast beat like slow hard beat last coupl second Is normal sorri post long Im kind obsess heart day thank

670,Atenolol+hypertension,In 1994; at the age of 15; I began having what was thought to be panic attacks by me and my parents. These episodes would generally last an hour; and would include palpitations and shortness of breath. In January 1997; after having several episodes lasting greater than 3 hours each; I was diagnosed with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome; and then mitral valve prolapse once an echo was performed. I was seen by a pediatric Electrophysiologist (Dr. Sterba) at the Cleveland Clinic. An RF Ablation was performed in May of that year. Everything was great for about a year; at which time I started experiencing sinus tachycardia with hypertension. Resting HR of 120-140; resting BP of 180/120. I went back to Cleveland; was put on beta blockers with the hopes of weaning me off of them and doing futher testing to determine why I was tachy. My EKG looked normal; with no delta wave present. I could not tolerate being weaned off of the beta blocker; and was left on it; at the same dose (50mg Atenolol) for about 2 years. This dose stopped holding me for 24 hours; and so I increased myself to 75mg/day (50mg qam; 25mg qpm). I did this only until I could get in to see my family physician. He changed me to 100mg Toprol XL qday. This only worked for about 12 hours however; then I was once again experiencing tachycardia. My dose was increased to 100mg bid. This seemed to keep my heart rate down; but my htn persisted at a low level (140/110). I was placed on Cozaar; 50mg qday; about a year later for the htn; but it persisted; at about the same level. Once I started seeing a cardiologist again; I was placed on 100mg Cozaar. A year later; after a follow up visit to my cardiologist; I was then placed on 100/12.5mg Hyzaar qday. I was instructed that my BP was to stay below 120/80. This final med has accomplished that. I have been in the 100/60 range for some time now; which has taken a while to get used to.

671,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 33 years old Male and a working executive in MNC. Right side upper lip numbness happened about 2 years ago gradually going upwards to cover the right cheek and nose part. Headeache also happened during the numbness. The period of numbness was half an hour and repeated about 4 times in 2 months. The timing of the occurence is same everytime that is after morning bath with hot water and at the rise of winters. I underwent the brain MRI; MRA; Heart related tests like LIPID profile; ECHO; etc. and everything was normal except a sign of sinusitis on right side. The numbness is repeated after 2 years now and it lasted for about 2-3 hours now; covering same area and happened at same time. The numbness covered right side upper lip; tooth jaw; right cheek and right side of the nose. Now again the brain MRI is normal. My neurologist said it is a general anxiety disorder. It is not TIA as MRI is normal even after 2 years. I want to check with you on that. Also want to check if migraine can cause one sided face numbness along with headache and what is the cure. By nature; I become anxious at times; worrying about petty things; etc. I am still wondering what is causing the numbness and that too lasting for more than 2 hours now. Is it a migraine? or GAD? or Sinusitus? OR something else? I also have a Hypertension history for about 5 years and currently on Atenolol 50 mg. My BP is mostly under control with the medication.

672,Atenolol+hypertension,I have high blood pressure. One year ago I was put on Accupril. Three months later I was switched to Lisinopril due to an insurance change. In May of '99 while driving to work; my heart began beating very hard. I could hear it beating in my head and it felt as if it could beat out of my chest. It was followed by two brief black-outs. Fortunately I made it to the side of the road without hurting anyone. I felt nauseated and had a very dry mouth. At the ER they gave me an EKG and a brain scan. When they determined nothing was seriously wrong with me they let me go. My doctor had me quit taking high blood pressure medication for awhile and see how I did. I was off of them for about 6 months when I started getting blood pressure headaches again. He then put me on 25 mg of Atenolol. I found immediate relief in headaches and my blood pressure went down. Two days ago while sitting at my desk at work; the heart started its hard beating again and I felt as if I could black out; but I did not. I stood up and walked for a minute and it went away. Neither episode occured during a stressful situation. Two doctors have told me that nothing can be done and that we can't know what it is unless we catch it while its happening. My fear is that I could black out again while driving and hurt not only myself but someone else. Has anyone heard anything like this? If so; what could be the problem? My doctor said the irregular rythms are normal; but he really didn't have an answer for the blacking out. I thought maybe my blood pressure was going to low; but he said no. I would appreciate any advice I could get.

I've had 4 EP studies; 3 with ablation. Tachys persist. AV node ablated; given unipolar pacemaker with single lead; later upgraded to bipolar with two leads; but original lead was left in. Have 3 wires. Echo last year was determined abnormal due to mild pulmonary hypertension with right vent and right atrial enlargement. Had moderate tricuspid regurg. Cardiologist here suggested I see a pulm hyperten specialist; but also suggested my pacemaker system could be contributing to my problem. I have become progressively worse with shortness of breath. With exertion I get jaw pain; nausea and dizziness. Cardiologist here says he isn't sure what to do. I recently went to another ""Best Hospital"" for evaluation and opinion (not yours). Had myoview stress test; showed some decrease in bloodflow in an area of my heart that resolved with rest. I went through cardiac cath. Early into procedure I had vent fibrillation. They said my arteries looked fine; but I had dyskinesia of my right vent. They planned to test for coronary art spasm; but abandoned it. They mentioned med Coreg; but abandoned it. Though they wanted to help me at first; after the cath they dumped me as patient with no further care. No pacer check for over 6 hours since defib; unmonitored.

674,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the ISV 14mm; all other measurements are within the normal limits; EF 55%; overall my other heart measurements though within the normal limits are on the smaller side; I've been told I have a very powerful heart.

When speaking of PVCs in the setting of a structurally normal being benign and not leading to SCD; would mild LVH like mine with everything thing else within the normal limits fall into the same category as being benign and not making one more prone to dangerous arrhythmias and SCD?

675,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the IVS; all other dimensions within normal limits last echo in mid 2005 showed an IVS of 14mm EF 55% no leakages of the valves; the cardiologist describes the jets as perfect whatever that means; I was in rush to catch a flight back and forgot to ask; though he assured me that I don't have HCM. I was mild hypertensive for years but is controlled with atenolol 100mg daily cozaar 25mg twice daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily; BP been averaging around 105/65 for couple of years now. In 2001 echo showed borderline LVH with dimensions ofthe IVS 10mm to12mm; with an of EF 65-70%; same cardio ; same echo machine. I was supposed to get an echo this year but due to unforseen events had to skip; Do you think with the info provided its is reasonable to wait another year? I'm 43 years old male and been a sufferer of tachycardia & PVcs all my life but all test was negative including echo; stress test and holter ; I rarely have PVCs anymore and no tachycardia at all; Does the diagnosis of Mild LVH put me at any significant increased risk for Sudden cardiac events? I also have ankylosing spondylitis; do you think that could be a contributing factor for LVH?; I know it can affect the aortic valve and conduction systems in a small % of persons with Ankylosing spondylitis.

678,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am 31 year old male and my series of problem started in May'07 on one of the evenings when I felt something like a signal passed to my head from stomach and felt dizzy. I became panic and went to see my family doctor (I have been on medication for primary hypertension for last 4 years). Blood tests; ECG etc has been conducted and nothing found wrong. He told me not to worry but I had started getting dizziness once in a while and I became very anxious about it. I also had a mild frontal headache and muscle weakness. Then I realized that I started getting panic when I face public in functions; taking flight journeys; worrying that I might faint. I went to see a neurologist in July'07 and after the physical excercise test; he told me nothing to worry; however I had insisted for an MRI. The MRI with contrast done in July07 (of brain with multiplanar T1w; T2w; FLAIR; GRE; DWI and post-gadolinium sequences) was perfect and no abnormalities found except presence of paranasal sinusitis (I have seen an ENT and polyps has been found in the frontal sinus. Subsequent CT scan showed my frontal sinus are filled with white matter and I am supposed to go for an operation to remove polyps). I was happy with the MRI results; however the dizziness episode and the frontal headache started disturbing me again in Sep'07 and my family doctor gave me antibiotics to clear the infection in sinuses. After three weeks of antibiotics course; the frontal headache was better; however I felt the dizziness; unbalanceness and weakness (especially on right side of the body) once in a while and I went to see the neurologist again in Dec'07 explaining my difficulties (Dizziness; numbness; unbalance; mild frontal headahe (especially above eyes); muscle weakness on left hand and leg; seeing floaters; anxiety; etc.). After conducting the physical tests; he told me nothing to worry and given me a tablet ""Lyrica 75 mg daily"". I have started taking it for last two weeks and there is a slight improvement in the numbness of my left leg and hand. When I asked my neuro on whether there is a need for MRI again; he told me re-scanning is not required at all and the recent MRI conducted in July'07 was perfect.

679,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 30yr/m and have had high blood pressure for the past 4-5 years. I currently take 25mg Atenolol once daily. My blood pressure is normally around 130/85 or so. Over the past 4 days I have been experiencing; what I believe are; panic attacks. I had some bad anxiety issues a few years ago; and the symptoms are very similar. During these attacks my blood pressure sky rockets. I check it yesterday after having one of these attacks and the reading was 165/110. Im quite sure it was much higher when I was actually having the symptoms since I was feeling much better at the time I took the reading. I think part of the fuel for the continued anxiety is the fear that I am going to have a stroke due to the sudden increase in blood pressure during the anxiety attacks. I have an appointment scheduled with my Dr. for this afternoon. My question is this: Is my fear that I could have a stroke due to my blood pressure getting so high during one these episodes legitimate or am I just worrying myself more? I have read different information that this sudden increase in blood pressure could cause a stroke; and then other which say that is not true; and that it takes many years of high blood pressure to cause a stroke to occur. I suppose i am afraid that my blood pressure will get too high during one of these episodes and a stroke will occur.

681,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe L3-L4 and L4-L5 stenosis. The MRI report also indicated moderate foraminal narrowing at 3 or 4 disc levels; and the report mentioned desiccation at all but one of the disc levels. The L4-L5 also indicated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet athrosis. What does this mean? 34 years - 6 foot 4 inches; 230 lbs. I have episodic numbness and pain in legs; but also have this problem in arms and hands too (numbness and slight tremor). I also have abdominal pains (mostly ULQ) and fluctuation in stool. I don't smoke or drink. I'm on paxil (mood); lisinopril and small dose of atenolol (hypertension). I have taken paxil and lisinopril for years. I had two ablations for SVT in 2006 - second one caused a PE which I took warfarin for 6 months. No clotting factors. The numbness started in my legs and affects my hands and forearms as well. Sometimes I feel this squeezing feeling either in my hands or in my lower back. When I sit for long periods and then stand up and walk I sometimes get episodes of numbness and weakness that make me have to walk slow and/or sit down and rest. Also I get some strange sensations in my hands and forearms...like holding a phone my hand gets tense and heavy and I have to switch hands. Also; both arms fall ""asleep"" at night; and I am not laying on them. I have a stiff/aching neck for over a year that waxes and wanes; but stays sore all the time. I have had several workups before the MRI. I have normal cbc; liver blood tests; mri of head; abdominal ct; no lyme; b12; no hepatitis; no cmv; blood smear neg pathogens; etc. Normal ncv/emg Could the arm involvement indicate some cervical stenosis? Can lumbar stenosis to affect the arms? Also; the digestive issues - testing (colonoscopy; endoscopy; etc) is normal. Could this stenosis cause this?

682,Atenolol+hypertension,"Mom 72; Singapore. Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) Daily BP: B4 breakfast - 140 PM & eve- 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?

683,Atenolol+hypertension,Back in December I felt a tightness in my chest and went to the doctor thinking I had a cold coming on. During the visit the doctor found my pulse to be fast (120). She sent me for an ECG which showed my pulse to be normal. They than sent me for a stress test and once again my pulse was high; but everything else was fine. The put me on beta blockers at this point to slow the rate of my heart and set up an echo. The echo showed my EF to be 35%. They have no idea what is causing my EF to be so low. I am a 26 year old female; fairly active; non-smoker; I drink a few times a year; normal cholestoral; not diabetic; slim build; low-normal blood pressure. I met with another doctor who has since put me on a second drug for hypertension. Both drugs low my blood pressure which is already boardline low. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I can expect or be doing now. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've been sort of stressing out about all of this as until Decemeber I considered myself to be a very healthy person. I feel completely blindsided by all of this.,2010,2010,26.0,Female,,,back decemb I felt tight chest went doctor think I cold come dure visit doctor found puls fast 120 she sent ecg show puls normal they sent stress test puls high everyth els fine the put beta blocker point slow rate heart set echo the echo show EF 35 they idea caus EF low I 26 year old femal fairli activ nonsmok I drink time year normal cholestor diabet slim build lownorm blood pressur I met anoth doctor sinc put second drug hypertens both drug low blood pressur alreadi boardlin low I wonder anyon advic I expect ani help would greatli appreci ive sort stress decemeb I consid healthi person I feel complet blindsid

685,Atenolol+hypertension,I had tests run on the following dates. Cat Scan in November showed 2 small renal cysts. I'm wondering first about the low GFR and (since the creatinine went up after the scan) if the dye Isovue could have affected it. Second; could the low hemoglobin and symptoms of anemia (fatigue; cold hands/feet; weakness; palpitations) be related to the low GFR and kidneys. (Iron deficiency anemia seems to be ruled out since I have hemochromatosis and my iron overload should prevent that along with all tests to check for any bleeding have come back negative.)

686,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everybody; Ok im a 23 year old male; weigh 290 but have been losing weight (i was 326 now im 290) i was diagnosed with High Blood Pressure about 6 months ago; i was running at about 160/85; Im taking metropolol 75 mg; bennicar 20 mg altough i was taking 25 mg of atenolol before the cardiologist put me on metropolol instead. Ive been having constant chest pain around my chest area; soetimes right in the middle or on the left side or left side by my ribcage. Its very disconcerning because each episode last about a couple seconds and is a sharp almost stabbing pain. My doctor has ahad blood work done on me and they found high cholesterol and slightly abnormal liver functions; it used to be that i had these pains maybe once or twice a week but now its daily; ive gone to the urgent care 5 times; er 2 times; etc; they all did ekg's and they all came back negative. Ive seen a cardiologist who did a ecchocardiogram and a stress test revealed nothing; my primary doctor also did a ct scan of my abdomen and pelvis and ct scan of my chest; also revealing nothing abnormal. I sometimes get this weird feeling of fullness around my nipple area wich is disconcerning. All doctors that have seen me have ruled out any heart problems; no mvp; no arrythmyas but it seems like its always around my chest area sometimes it might originate from the middle of my chest an feel it go trough to my back. The other thing i have noticed is when i go to slep at night it seems like i cnt sleep; and when i wake up my heart is pounding like if i just ran a marathon.

687,Atenolol+hypertension,Im 47 yr old very overweight female. I have yearly physicals..just had one a few days ago. Have generalized anxiety..panic attacks. Hypertension..although am on Atenolol; which keeps my bp nearly normal...last Thurs it was 120/80.. recently developed GERD....and am on prilosec for that...other than that; and being overweight...oh; and have benign palpitations that Ive had for 20 years...other than those things; Im really healthy. Ive talked to my Dr and she is all for me starting a walking exercise program. UGH. But I am serious about doing it. The thing is..about a week ago ( before I started walking) I notice when I walk even a short distance...or when I take the basement stairs up; I get a tightness in my chest..not really my chest though..more in my stomach area...in the center..at the base of my breastbone..not between the breasts even.Slightly below that area. Its weird. I do not have it when Im sitting still--and since this is one of my personal symtoms of anxiety...I have been just ignoring it...as much as I can. When I started my walking program on Friday...wow; when i walked the first half block ..it felt like I had a brick there..in that area..but the more I walked..the less I felt it. At the end of my walk..I have no chest tightness at all..that whole feeling is gone. I cant even say that when Im having that tightness; that I am short of breath; because I am NOT really. No pain of any kind...its just like somebody blew up a balloon inside me; in that area...how weird; huh? Almost exactly a year ago to today; I had a complete cardiac workup..echo; ekg...stress test...because of the palpitations..and everything was perfect. I wonder...do I need to have a whole new cardiac workup? Do I just keep on my walking program; and if any other symptom ( ex- pain; dizzy; etc) shows up then call? this feeling unnerves me...and so of course my anxiety has a good hold of me during this time.... so now..I am basically expecting to feel that way anytime I get up and walk across the room... I really want to be serious about my exercise program; and getting this weight off... help...,2007,2009,,Female,,,Im 47 yr old overweight femal I yearli physicalsjust one day ago have gener anxietypan attack hypertensionalthough atenolol keep bp nearli normallast thur 12080 recent develop gerdand prilosec thatoth overweightoh benign palpit ive 20 yearsoth thing Im realli healthi ive talk Dr start walk exercis program ugh but I seriou the thing isabout week ago I start walk I notic I walk even short distanceor I take basement stair I get tight chestnot realli chest thoughmor stomach areain centerat base breastbonenot breast evenslightli area it weird I Im sit stilland sinc one person symtom anxietyi ignor ita much I when I start walk program fridaywow walk first half block felt like I brick therein areabut I walkedth less I felt At end walki chest tight allthat whole feel gone I cant even say Im tight I short breath I not realli No pain kindit like somebodi blew balloon insid areahow weird huh almost exactli year ago today I complet cardiac workupecho ekgstress testbecaus palpitationsand everyth perfect I wonderdo I need whole new cardiac workup Do I keep walk program symptom ex pain dizzi etc show call feel unnerv meand cours anxieti good hold time nowi basic expect feel way anytim I get walk across room I realli want seriou exercis program get weight help

689,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question I hope someone will be able to answer. In the next few months I am hoping to receive a class 1 medical clearance for employment purposes. I was diagnosed with SVT in July 2007; but it is now perfectly controlled with medicine (atenolol; which I also take to control my high blood pressure). It was only diagnosed as I was going through an extremely stressful time in my life and was having roughly 10 small arrythmia episodes per day which prompted me to see a cardiologist . Since then; I have maybe 2-3 a month that last 5 seconds or less. They are more of a nuisance than anything else. My cardiologist never seems concerned about it. I know that medical clearances are granted for controlled hypertension; so I am not worried about that part of my medical history. But I am a bit nervous I will be denied because of my SVT. Does anyone know if medical clearances are typically denied for people with SVT; even if it is controlled with medication? Many thanks for any input.,2010,2010,,Male,,,hello I question I hope someon abl answer In next month I hope receiv class 1 medic clearanc employ purpos I diagnos svt juli 2007 perfectli control medicin atenolol I also take control high blood pressur It diagnos I go extrem stress time life roughli 10 small arrythmia episod per day prompt see cardiologist sinc I mayb 23 month last 5 second less they nuisanc anyth els My cardiologist never seem concern I know medic clearanc grant control hypertens I worri part medic histori but I bit nervou I deni svt doe anyon know medic clearanc typic deni peopl svt even control medic mani thank input
690,Atenolol+hypertension,"hello. Something very scary happened at 3am this morning my mom sat up in bed and was going to go the the toilet to pee like she always does and then her stomach felt weired; and she passed out; my dad was unable to wake her; he checked for breathing she was breathing; he called 911; when she came to she the last thing she remembered was sitting on the edge of her bed. she went to ER by ambulance; where they found she was hypotensive and tachycardic; they took blood everything was fine except her potassium and sodium were both markedly low. They assumed she was dehydrated; but she drinks a lot of water. This is unusual becuase my mom has been hyPERtenstive for as long as I can remember and takes 100mg of atenolol and 25mg of HCTZ every day becuase without it her BP would be dangerously high and she has a history of hypertension and stroke on her side of the family. She also has never passed out in her life; she will be 62 in june. She also takes a daily calcium supplement; a multivite and fish oil. her ekg was fine but they are keeping her overnight and are going to also do an echo and some other tests. she also had a fever of 101.2 and they just gave her tylenol and ibuprofin I am also worried becuase she was an avid user of darvon (not darvocet with tylenol; just darvon) and took it for a long time for her artritis pain. in novemeber the FDA removed it from the market due to cardiac risks. But I was reading about the recall; and on several sites including webmd they quoted Gerald Dal Pan; MD; MHS; director of the FDA's office of surveillance and epidemiology saying; ""Long-term users should not worry: The heart effects are not cumulative;"" he says. ""Once people stop using propoxyphene; the side (should go away."" I am really worried (becuase she's my mom shes my rock shes my everything and thats what I do) does anyone feel like playing doctor for me? any ideas why this is happening? does it sound like an infection? or auto immune? or did she actually maybe have a heart attack? or a reaction to something she ingested? also; she is a visiting nurse and goes into half a dozen sick peoples houses every day and also sees patients in assisted living homes. please maybe throw out some ideas I am just really scared and worried I love my mom more than anyone else in this whole world she is the most selfless person and if anything bad happened to her now; I don't know how I would go on living. she was fine yesterday and last night when she went to bed. thanks",2009,2011,24.0,Female,,,hello someth scari happen 3am morn mom sat bed go go toilet pee like alway stomach felt weir pass dad unabl wake check breath breath call 911 came last thing rememb sit edg bed went ER ambul found hypotens tachycard took blood everyth fine except potassium sodium markedli low they assum dehydr drink lot water thi unusu becuas mom hypertenst long I rememb take 100mg atenolol 25mg hctz everi day becuas without BP would danger high histori hypertens stroke side famili she also never pass life 62 june she also take daili calcium supplement multivit fish oil ekg fine keep overnight go also echo test also fever 1012 gave tylenol ibuprofin I also worri becuas avid user darvon darvocet tylenol darvon took long time artriti pain novemeb fda remov market due cardiac risk but I read recal sever site includ webmd quot gerald dal pan MD mh director fda offic surveil epidemiolog say longterm user worri the heart effect cumul say onc peopl stop use propoxyphen side go away I realli worri becuas she mom she rock she everyth that I anyon feel like play doctor idea happen sound like infect auto immun actual mayb heart attack reaction someth ingest also visit nurs goe half dozen sick peopl hous everi day also see patient assist live home pleas mayb throw idea I realli scare worri I love mom anyon els whole world selfless person anyth bad happen I dont know I would go live fine yesterday last night went bed thank

693,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 23 year old male; in generally good health except that I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. I am a high-stress individual. The problem started when I noticed every time I had even a sip of coffee I felt like I was going to pass out. This was strange because I drank coffee heavily since I was probably 12 or so. This began about 3 months after I quit using cocaine; which I had used for about 9 - 11 months. Not something I'm proud of but that's the way it is. I have since been to a cardiologist; and had an echo-cardiogram; various blood tests (to check for ACS and clots; thyroid; etc.); chest CT; 24 - hour monitor and will have a stress test in a couple of days. I have been taking atenolol for about 6 months or so now; with moderate success. But; I still cannot have even more than a taste of coffee; or any caffeinated product. I used to smoke marijuana regularly with no problems and only in the last few months have I also become unable to do this as well. Every time I get a greatly elevated HR and similar sensations that i do from caffeine; which again is strange given my historical record with it. I don't use it regularly; but this development is still strange. My cardiologist doesn't really know what to tell me; other than everything is fine. All these things; in my mind; do not tell me that I am fine. I also have chronic chest pains that are centralized at the mid-base of my left rib cage and seem to be movement related; but have persisted off and on in the same location for about a year now. Any suggestions?,2008,2008,,,,,I 23 year old male gener good health except I recent diagnos hypertens I highstress individu the problem start I notic everi time I even sip coffe I felt like I go pass thi strang I drank coffe heavili sinc I probabl 12 thi began 3 month I quit use cocain I use 9 11 month not someth Im proud that way I sinc cardiologist echocardiogram variou blood test check ac clot thyroid etc chest CT 24 hour monitor stress test coupl day I take atenolol 6 month moder success but I still even tast coffe caffein product I use smoke marijuana regularli problem last month I also becom unabl well everi time I get greatli elev HR similar sensat caffein strang given histor record I dont use regularli develop still strang My cardiologist doesnt realli know tell everyth fine all thing mind tell I fine I also chronic chest pain central midbas left rib cage seem movement relat persist locat year ani suggest
694,Atenolol+hypertension,Does anyone knows what causes LVH? I was told that I had HBP in 1998 and it's been uncontrollable ever since the doctor switched me from Inderal to Atenolol. He told me that Inderal was for geriatrics; but it was the only medicine that kept my BP under total control. Is LVH congential? One of my brothers had a valve replacement last year; we've always knew that he had this problem ever since he was little. The doctors always would tell our parents that my brother had a whole in his valve which caused the blood to squirt out into the chest cavity and that his valve will eventually fail when he gets older. The reason why I ask is LVH congenitial is becaue I was just diagnosed with it after I had an echo done. Then I had an pulmonary test done to check for COPD and/or asthma and was told I had neither one; but diagnosed me with CHF. Does anyone know how serious LVH and CHF is and are the reversible?

695,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. Yesterday I went to the new PCP I've been seeing; and he did another EKG. This time he said it showed a non specific abnormality. He diagnosed sinus tachycardia as my HR can get high. He is a very ""scattered brain"" doctor though. He can't seem to remember anything I tell him; and I think he's a flat out ""quack!"" Has any other women had similar heart symptoms after childbirth - high BP with racing heart? Can EKG's very so much between only a few months? What are non specific abnormalities on EKG's? I'm an LPN; but the heart isn't my specialty; and it's been a while since nursing school.

696,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had this test because sometimes when I walk fast I get shortness of breath and squeezing in my chest and back Myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging revealed a partially reversible anterior defect; quantitaively equivocal..Left ventricular global function at post stress was normal with an ejection fraction of 60%.Gated wall motion analysis revealed normall wall motion and normal thickeniing of all myocardial segments. Left ventricular transient cavity dilatation was not observed. There was no abnormal lun uptake of radioisotoe. The quality of the study was suboptimal due to severe atenutation from a BMI of 51. Anterior ischemia can not be excluded. In view of the risk factor profile; family history of cvd; marked obesity; dysipedemia; hypertension; sedentary lifestyle; poor functional capacity and equivocal SPECT perfusion studym PET scan is advised. Maximal stress test to a heart rate of 134 bpm or 85% of predicted maximum for age 64 Typical anginal symptoms did not occur. The ekg response was negagtive for inducible ischemial. The blood pressure response to exercise was appropiate with a hypertensive baseline. The patient's functional capacity was markedly decreased. My doctor wants me to use nitro patch and mentioned maybe a Pet scan he said would take time . I am not comfortable to use nitro because I live alone and my bp may drop low and it could make me dizzy. I am seeing my doctor tomorrow; I am takin atenolol maxzide kdur and multivitamin lipitor and baby aspirin. Baseline ekg before test was normal sinus rhythm heart rate 81 and bp 144/70. I am concerned the doctor said it was slighty abnormal and not definitive. He said I could have a blockage of 70%. Can you clarify this test and his answer.

699,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to ""white coat syndrome""; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9"" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event"" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour. My cholesterol was 225; trigylycerides in normal range; with LDL of 159 & HDL of 49. I do not have a family history of any heart disease. I do not smoke & never have. I have one glass of red wine a day. Because my husband developed high BP & then A-fib; we have been eating a low fat; high fiber diet for over a year. I had rheumatic fever as a child; but doctors have not heard a heart murmur for years. Up until now I have been very healthy all of my adult life. I have a B.S. in medical technology. As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP. We have good insurance so can having any testing that is required; but I would prefer not to get into anything invasive until we have exhausted the non-invasive options.",2008,2008,,Female,,,I 53 yr femal start experienc continu puls rate 100 after famili doctor wrote white coat syndrom I switch internist she 1st place atenolol 50 mg I could toler even reduc 25 mg I could sleep asthmat problem raynoud syndrom My BP usual either normal prehypertens rang last two year I 59 185 lb I exercis walk dog 2 mile day weight lift least week I diltiazem 240 mg the internist increas 120 mg I spike 14090 BP It appear higher dosag control BP morn 11069 necessarili puls rate 99 yesterday afternoon I 30 day cardiac monitor start 12308 I one event puls 120 went back high 90 hour My cholesterol 225 trigylycerid normal rang ldl 159 hdl 49 I famili histori heart diseas I smoke never I one glass red wine day becaus husband develop high BP afib eat low fat high fiber diet year I rheumat fever child doctor heard heart murmur year Up I healthi adult life I BS medic technolog As scientist I satisfi take medicin I realli want understand whi My internist say diltiazem control tachycardia end week refer cardiologist she said doesnt mani drug work high puls rate someon high BP We good insur test requir I would prefer get anyth invas exhaust noninvas option
700,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old with an AAIR pacemaker implanted for three sinus node ablations for IST that left me with a junctional rhythm.Pacemaker has been functioning very well and have been feeling great since it was implanted in Nov. 2004.Over the passt 3-4 weeks I have had a lot of fatigue; weakness and a lot of lightheadedness.I occasionally feel short of breath at times.My cardiologist checked the pacemaker and said everything was functioning fine and also check an echo(was normal) and all basic labwork(all normal).My pacemaker check did reveal that my heart rate was not getting past 90; so they made some adjustments to the rate respone feature.I am very; very active and run and do cardiovascular exercise 3-5 times/week for an hour.I am just very; very exhausted now and feel so much different than I did.BP's have been normal.I feel absolutley wiped out after my workouts now; instead of good after them like I used to.I am going to a pulmonary dr. to rule anything with my lungs out.Cardiologist thought maybe my BP was low. Checked it at home and readings were lying-109/69; hr-79; sitting 117/75; hr-75; standing 134/78; hr-74.Shouldn't my HR go up as I stand up?Do you think this is pacemaker related? Should I have them try to reprogram my pacemaker on a treadmill or check it further? Does this sound like a pacemaker syndrome; or would that show up on an EKG?Cardiologist had me increase my salt intake with thought that BP was low; but it appears normal?Should I just ignore my symptoms and move on?I feel bad to keep pestering my dr.No other medical problems in my history.Thanks,2004,2006,,,,,I 28 year old aair pacemak implant three sinu node ablat ist left junction rhythmpacemak function well feel great sinc implant nov 2004over passt 34 week I lot fatigu weak lot lightheadednessi occasion feel short breath timesmi cardiologist check pacemak said everyth function fine also check echowa normal basic labworkal normalmi pacemak check reveal heart rate get past 90 made adjust rate respon featurei activ run cardiovascular exercis 35 timesweek houri exhaust feel much differ I didbp normali feel absolutley wipe workout instead good like I use toi go pulmonari dr rule anyth lung outcardiologist thought mayb BP low check home read lying10969 hr79 sit 11775 hr75 stand 13478 hr74shouldnt HR go I stand updo think pacemak relat should I tri reprogram pacemak treadmil check doe sound like pacemak syndrom would show ekgcardiologist increas salt intak thought BP low appear normalshould I ignor symptom move oni feel bad keep pester drno medic problem historythank
701,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi again! I have written several times here and I want to make sure that all of the doctors on this forum are greatly appreciated! I was just wondering how long a beta blocker like Atenelol stays in the blood stream! I am going off of it because it has been making my asthma worse! However; I have been experiencing tachycardia as I go off the Atenelol! How long does the transition usually last and can it be dangerous? i only take 12 1/2 mg in the am and again in the pm. I think this is a low dose anyway! Also does this low dose usually cause asthma problems? I almost hate going off the Atenelol because it has helped my tachycardia (caused from anxiety) a lot! I also have a prescription for KLonopin. Could this hel pwith the tachycardia in place of the Atenelol? Is Klonopin and Atenelol safe to use together since they both lower heart rate? My doctor assured me it was safe! Thanks again! You all have been a lot of help to me and my hypochondria!!! :) Jamie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jamie: The dose of atenolol you are on is low. Nevertheless; I would favor tapering the dose over a few days; such as by stopping the evening dose for a few days; and then stopping altogether. However; you should discuss the specifics of stopping the medicine with your own doctor; and do what he tells you to. Even this low dose can cause asthma to worsen. Stopping atenolol abruptly can cause problems; but usually in people that have angina or hypertension. It should be safe to use Klonopin and atenolol together. Klonopin is an anti-anxiety medication and is not directly a treatment for tachycardia. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Only your doctor can provide specific diagnoses and treatments.

It is kind of scaring me; even though I have had all of the tests in the past to confirm that my heart is ok. I just hate palps and these are really bad.

707,Atenolol+hypertension,My 12 y/o son just started suffering from exercise induced SVT 2 days in a row he went into SVT rate of 240 bpm lasting a few hours. The first day he needed 6 mg of Adenosine the second it broke on its own after lying down on the litter in the ambulance. I am a paramedic and so is his father neither one of us is very familiar with children suffering from SVT. We are going to see a pediatric cardiologist on Monday and I would like to have some ideas in my head as to actions. I have been doing a bunch of reading and it appears radiofrequency ablation is the best option however I have not seen very much on children. Do you think it is safe for children or are medications a better route?

708,Atenolol+hypertension,34 year old mother of two with a history of minor restrictive lung disease of unknown origin; hereditary fatty liver & sinus tachycardia. Symptoms of breathlessness have increased and sudden onset of muscle weakness; muscle atrophy of both arms; and muscle spasms from head to toe as well as severe pain in arms/ shoulders. Have been evaluated by primary doctor and labs revealed low Vit B so I have recd 1 mo of shots. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated and potasium low. Shoulder pain evaluated and ruled out pinced nerve through MRI of cervical spine. MRI showed reverse lardosis (backward or no curve of neck) and 3 bulging discs which they say is not enough to cause my muscle problems. Sent by Orthopedic Specialist to Neurologist who suspected Vitamin B culprit for muscle weakness. Have an appt to see him again next week. The only other weird thing is that they are having lots of trouble taking blood and were unable to find a vein to administer CT contrast in. My veins clot up easily and despite regular fluid intake and my fingers appear very dehydrated (odd shaped and look like they have been in water- very wrinkly). This has not ever been a problem in the past nor have the muscles had such issues. Meanwhile; visited Pulmonologist to receive update on lung capacity- dropped from mid 70's to mid 60's. Completed lung function tests including CT of chest. Results pending. The only other thing I know is that today my oxygen level fell below 85 during mild exercise test. Have an appt to see heart specialist Fri and have been struggling with elevated heart rate despite being on beta blocker already. My meds include: Atenolol; HCTZ (fluid retention for years); Norvasc (for chest pain); Potasium supplements; Flexeril (muscle spasms); and PRN of Percocet (about 1 tab every other day to get a break from pain in arms. Any advice would be helpful on questions to ask doctor or tests to request. Thank you so much for any help you can offer!

709,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26yo female around 15-20pounds overweight. I have slightly to high blood pressure (usually around 135 / 90) and my resting heart rate is usually around 85-90. When I exercise my heart rate goes waaaaaay up. Just while walking 1.5 mile (in 30min) my heart rate went all the way up to 182bpm. The average herat rate was 143bpm. When I'm doing something a little bit more extreme it can go up to 200 and the average is around 160bpm. Should I be worried about this or is it just because I'm a little out of shape? My resting heart rate has always been around 90bpm even if I've been in a realy good shape. And should I just walk for now or is it ok to do something more difficult like ice-hockey or jogging? Is it possible that I have POTs? When I sit my heart rate is 85-90 but when I stand up it goes to 120 within 2 minutes but than it goes down to around 110.

710,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking Metoprolol Tartrate at various strengths for many years. I contined to take it following my ablation two and a half years ago on the advice of my PCP as a measure of safety against hypertension and heart attack survivability should one ever occur. I have leveled out on 75mg per day. I see my PCP every six months and I've noticed that each time I go; my blood pressure drops lower and lower. On my last visit several days ago; my BP was measured twice to be sure and it was 102/60. My physician didn't say anything; but I was wondering the following: The half life of Metoprolol results in a residulal amount remaining when the next dose occurs. This repeats over and over for months .... years. I would think this could cause a gradual build-up of the drug to possible very high levels. We all know that Metoprolol lowers blood pressure. Could this be the reason for my low normal readings? I still workout and skate very hard and have noticed lately that my heart is slower to respond to physical demands and that I can't get my peak heart rate above 185bpm. Any ideas?,2010,2013,,Male,,,ive take metoprolol tartrat variou strength mani year I contin take follow ablat two half year ago advic pcp measur safeti hypertens heart attack surviv one ever occur I level 75mg per day I see pcp everi six month ive notic time I go blood pressur drop lower lower On last visit sever day ago BP measur twice sure 10260 My physician didnt say anyth I wonder follow the half life metoprolol result residul amount remain next dose occur thi repeat month year I would think could caus gradual buildup drug possibl high level We know metoprolol lower blood pressur could reason low normal read I still workout skate hard notic late heart slower respond physic demand I cant get peak heart rate 185bpm ani idea
711,Atenolol+hypertension,hello doctor; i am 24 years oldfor the past 5 years i consistently exercises 5-6 times a week combined with cardio and heavy lifting. i am 162 pounds 5'8 im am probably 7% body fat; i do not take steroids or take anything bad. i do not smoke or drink. I am in nursing school so balancing school; life; and work has been stressful as of late. I consulted with my doctor because i have experiencing fluctuations in my blood pressure it can get as high as 140 systolic but diastolic is within normal range (70) but when im stress free its about 116-67. It could be from stress; i told her about some issues anxiety and palpitations but my heart rate is about 50-60 most of the time. So anyway she prescribed me 1/2 mg of atenolol a day and she sent me for an echo. My blood pressure has been good since i have been on atenolol. i had the echo and here are the results which has been concerning to me. aorctic root 29; left atrium 27; LVOT 20; septum 10; posterior wall 9; LVEDD 52; LVESD 38. The study is of good technical qualtiy. The left atrium is normal in size. the left ventricle is at the upper limits of normal in size with borderline systolic function. The estimated ejection fraction is 50-55%. NO regional wall motion abnormalities were identified. The mitral valve demonstrates normal excursion. There is mild mitral valve regurge. The aorctic valve is tricuspid and is normal in appearance. There is no aortic insufficiency seen. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The right atrium appears normal is size. The tricuspid valve is normal in appearance with mild tricuspid valve regurg. The estimated PA pressure is 33 mmhg. The pulmonic valve is grossly normal in appearance with no insufficiency seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Impression: Borderline left ventricular enalrgement with low-normal systolic function Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Boderline pulmonary hypertension. Anyway she told me since i workout very much and look very muscular there could be some overexertion; i couldnt really understand why this could cause it. She wants me to have another echo in a year. She asked how i was doing on atenolol and i told her i was tolerating it well and ask me if i would like to continue to be on the drug and we both decided there is no harm into that. She told me not to worry about it but if it continues to get bigger there is a cause for concern. So i ask for a cardiologist opinion here to help me breath a little easier thank you so much..,2011,2011,24.0,Male,,,hello doctor 24 year oldfor past 5 year consist exercis 56 time week combin cardio heavi lift 162 pound 58 im probabl 7 bodi fat take steroid take anyth bad smoke drink I nurs school balanc school life work stress late I consult doctor experienc fluctuat blood pressur get high 140 systol diastol within normal rang 70 im stress free 11667 It could stress told issu anxieti palpit heart rate 5060 time So anyway prescrib 12 mg atenolol day sent echo My blood pressur good sinc atenolol echo result concern aorctic root 29 left atrium 27 lvot 20 septum 10 posterior wall 9 lvedd 52 lvesd 38 the studi good technic qualtiy the left atrium normal size left ventricl upper limit normal size borderlin systol function the estim eject fraction 5055 NO region wall motion abnorm identifi the mitral valv demonstr normal excurs there mild mitral valv regurg the aorctic valv tricuspid normal appear there aortic insuffici seen the right ventricl normal size function the right atrium appear normal size the tricuspid valv normal appear mild tricuspid valv regurg the estim PA pressur 33 mmhg the pulmon valv grossli normal appear insuffici seen there pericardi effus impress borderlin left ventricular enalrg lownorm systol function mild mitral tricuspid regurgit boderlin pulmonari hypertens anyway told sinc workout much look muscular could overexert couldnt realli understand could caus she want anoth echo year she ask atenolol told toler well ask would like continu drug decid harm she told worri continu get bigger caus concern So ask cardiologist opinion help breath littl easier thank much
712,Atenolol+hypertension,"Dear Dr: Thanks again for a very informative and helpful site. I am a 36yr f; w/3 children and work p/t I am also on the b/c patch to control irregular cycles. This past Fri. I took my son to his bowling league. I went into the snack shop and felt tightness in my chest. I thought it was from the smokey atmosphere. No chest pain or rapid heartrate. I felt like this for the rest of the evening. Almost like not being able to take a deep breath in; that a good ""sigh"" would help. I felt like my b/p was high. I took it on Sat. and it ranged during the day from 110/75 to 130/95 mostly on the high side all day. I normally have low b/p 110/70. I have allergies and MVP by echo as mild and not meeting strict criteria from MVP but I suffer from dysautonomia. I went to a walk-in clinic on Sun. My b/p was 114/95 dr. said he would not even give the b/p readidng a 2nd thought;ekg normal; chest x-ray normal and O2 normal b/c which I have taken for the past 3 months and previously took b/c on and off for years did not feel connection. Was sent home as anxiety/stress related.I had a visit with my gp/cardio on the Weds. prior and had normal ekg and b/p. Since I feel very congested in my sinus since that time; could that cause the rise? Allergies? Does is sound stress related; the ""tight band around the chest"" feeling and tight neck muscles.

714,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion.

715,Atenolol+hypertension,I ws diagnosed with high blood pressure but as far as i know i dont have it. i had it the day i went to the doctor because i was freaking out. ever since ive tested my blood pressure and its been normal. i do have a vein on my left side of the neck that bulges somewhat when i lean forward or bend down; raise my left arm and i little bit when im eating. i can see that the vein is much more superficial on that side compared to the other side. i say this because i can se where the vein is even when it is flat. also if i put my finger on it then it bulges too as if im blocking it. im pretty sure that this vein drains blood since when i cover the top nothing happens but when i cover the bottom it bulges. ive had two doctors tell me that its my carotid and that i should not worry about it. ive also heard that thin people with bigger neck muscles tend to have this sometimes and its normal. i recently lost weight and thats around when it happened. i went from 165 to about 153 or so. im in my 20s and have no other symptoms (no chest pain or shortness of breath etc..) or pains. i dont know what this could be but im kind of worried that it could be something to do with the heart. when my physician listen to my heart he said it was normal he also listened to the veins in the neck with the stethoscope. i dont know what to think. please help me out. thanks a lot;,2007,2007,,,,,I ws diagnos high blood pressur far know dont day went doctor freak ever sinc ive test blood pressur normal vein left side neck bulg somewhat lean forward bend rais left arm littl bit im eat see vein much superfici side compar side say se vein even flat also put finger bulg im block im pretti sure vein drain blood sinc cover top noth happen cover bottom bulg ive two doctor tell carotid worri ive also heard thin peopl bigger neck muscl tend sometim normal recent lost weight that around happen went 165 153 im 20 symptom chest pain short breath etc pain dont know could im kind worri could someth heart physician listen heart said normal also listen vein neck stethoscop dont know think pleas help thank lot
716,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks",2008,2008,,,,,hello Dr I 33 year old male hypertens bicuspid aorta for year I great deal health anxieti manifest fast heart rate occasion palpit mayb arrythmia etc doctor believ anxieti play role hypertens I take 25mg atenolol 20mg lisinopril daili bp read avg 13085 My problem Im alway scare sudden death Im athlet I work 45 time week whenev I read athlet suddenli die heart relat problem Im sure also happen ive worn holter monitor get regular echo due bicuspid diagnosi stress echo event monitor theyv never realli found anyth stenosi cardiomyopathi etc So I feel pretti comfort structur heart fine wont caus problem I still worri electr problem would seen thing like brugada syndrom long QT syndrom recogn problem vagal tone etc should I ask see EP cardiologist well basic current symptom occasion flutter especi right I fall asleep occasion rapid heart rate feel weaker normal accompani sensat base neck carotid arteri vagu nerv for reason I shake fear thank
717,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Over the course of 24 hours I was running a fever due to an infection in my leg that I am being treated for. It peaked at 102.7 or thereabouts. My heart was beating faster than normal. I'm on atenolol which normally keeps it to between 68 and 74 bpm. In the ER my heart rate was 98 and BP peaked at 134/85. Given my known condition of having a fusifom ascending aortic aneurysm of 4.1 X 4.2; dilated aortic root; enlarged heart; mitral regurgitation and overall heart enlargement as revealed by two CT scans a year apart; and three echo studies; is there a reason for greater concern?

718,Atenolol+hypertension,Glad I found this forum. I'm a 33 year old Caucasian; female. I'm 5'4; 143 lbs. I have always been kind of an anxious person... (runs in my family) After my first daughter was born in 2002; I developed high BP during the end of the pregnancy; & during labor that never really went away. I have been on BP medicine since. I've been diagnosed with primary hypertension & sinus tachycardia. I currently take Bystolic 5 mg once daily. Used to take atenolol and Toprol for BP; but they didn't work well for me. I also used to take Zoloft for anxiety; but had to stop due to weight gain. Plus; my anxiety got better and I really didn't need it anymore. I see a cardiologist every 6 months for the BP & tachycardia. I had a stressful year last year and my anxiety started to come back. Just recently I have developed panic attacks; so to speak. Whenever I get a little nervous about a situation; the nervousness can develop in to a panic attack. The last two times I've went to the doctor I started to get nervous (white coat syndrome) & my BP and heart rate skyrocketed. My BP was 153/112; pulse was 126. I talked to my cardiologist about this; but he thought I was probably find unless my BP was staying consistently elevated which it doesn't; once the panic attack is over. With the BP medicine; my BP is about 120/81; pulse 77 normally. I have had normal EKG's; echos; and a normal 24 hour heart monitor and blood work. Cardiologist has listened to heart and lungs and says normal. My anxiety seems to be doing this. I get so anxious my BP and HR go up drastically. My cardiologist wrote me 10 mg Celexa to try for the anxiety; but I'm afraid it will make me gain weight like the Zoloft. I was just wondering any others in their 20s or 30s with anxiety dealing with these kind if symptoms with their anxiety? Anyone take celexa? If so did cause weight gain?

719,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been in the hospital 2 time with a-fib. The first time I was drinking and running around out on an island and my heart started going crazy. They were able to get it back to normal in the ICU and I was on meds for a few months. The second time (1 year and 1/2 later) I was laying in bed and my leg cramped and I had an episode. Again; they got it under control and informed me that because I have had issues in the past I was 80% more likely to have it again. My current cardiologist has me in a daily dose of Metoprorol and baby asprin. I have been on this for over 2 years now and they have not changed anything.

720,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 27 year old female & I started having BP problems about a year ago (at least that's when I first found out). I am now on 3 medications a day (Atenolol; Methalydopa; Hydrochlorizide). I take 50mg; 250mg; 25mg of the above meds. My BP is still about where it was when I first started taking the meds. It ranges from 135-160/90-117. High BP runs in my family; but no one else has seemed to have such a problem getting it under control. I have had my kidneys tested & some blood work (Cholesterol & Trig. are a little high; but not too bad). I have had one ekg with nothing found; and I am scheduled for another. I am a little overweight (180lbs...I find it difficult to lose the weight); but don't know if there is anything else that might be causing the problem. I try to watch my sodium intake; I quite drinking Caffine; & I ocassionaly drink alcohol. I excercise regularly. My dr. acts like it is abnormal to have such a problem at my age that the meds aren't able to control. She doesn't want to get me on too much medicine b/c of my age & if I would choose to have a child. Is there anything else I should be looking into as a possible cause; or do I just chalk this up as a hereditary disease & go with it? After my last Dr. Apt; she scheduled me an apt. with a cardiologist.

723,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39 yr old male with permenant A-fib. I was put on metatropal and dijoxin 2 1/2 years ago. Doctor changed the beta to a calcium channel blocker a year ago and my exercise tolerance improved greatly. Recently ; after completing a marathon training program; my HR was 39 bpm in his office; so I was pulled off the Dij. After a month off dij; a holter found my HR was down to 35 at night with periods of 3.7 second pauses. This led to being switched to a beta blocker that has a pacing effect built in. I now find it difficult to run over six miles; due to difficulty in getting full breaths. 1) Is it generally harder to exercise on a beta rather than a calcium channel blocker? 2)Do they make a CC blocker that has the pacing effect (drops out on the low end)? 3)At what point do the long pauses pose a problem? 4)Am I better living with the high heart rate (180 to 220 during activity) or the low; since I have never felt real detrimental effects from either?,2001,2002,,,,,I 39 yr old male permen afib I put metatrop dijoxin 2 12 year ago doctor chang beta calcium channel blocker year ago exercis toler improv greatli recent complet marathon train program HR 39 bpm offic I pull dij after month dij holter found HR 35 night period 37 second paus thi led switch beta blocker pace effect built I find difficult run six mile due difficulti get full breath 1 Is gener harder exercis beta rather calcium channel blocker 2do make CC blocker pace effect drop low end 3at point long paus pose problem 4am I better live high heart rate 180 220 activ low sinc I never felt real detriment effect either

726,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm new to this forum. I am in a complicated ""pickle"" I guess you could say. I am a 21 year old male with hypertension but for the most part it is under control via medications. I have been having shortness of breath; chest pain(less often); and chest tightness in the center of the chest. This has started about 7 months ago. Since then; about 5-6 months ago; I had an ultrasound of the heart(I don't know the exact name of it; it is better than a stress test and has a 99% accuracy rate) by a good rated cardiologist; MRI's MRA's of my body including ultrasound of the abdomen; gall bladder tests; a 48-hour Holter monitor test(normal); Seen a pulmonologist; had a spirometer (everything is normal); Saw a GI specialist had an endoscopy; and a barium swallow. Polyps were found and removed. Biopsies came back normal other than some inflammation of the stomach. Since symptoms started I have been to the ER about 6 times also; everything was normal sent home every time. But here's the catch. I still have random chest pains in the center or just to the left of my chest; and when I get emotionally into a song; video game; or say a movie; my chest tightens up in the center and it really scares me. My doctor and pretty much all of my specialists insist they think I'm fine without further investigation. Furthermore; I have shortness of breath pretty much the whole day as I have been since all of this started. And recently; hours after drinking alcohol and sleeping; I awake with palpitations which has never happened to me before. Also in the past month I have been diagnosed with bronchitis; then I had a sinus infection; and now I have a virus which is kinda peculiar I've never been this consecutively sick and I don't know if my shortness of breath is because all of this. I pretty much have no life anymore because I don't know what's wrong with me and I pretty much am in fear of dying all of the time because all of this chest discomfort. If this isn't my heart; I'm convinced it's stomach related? I'm sick of every doctor saying it's anxiety I'm not even generally an anxious person. Please any suggestions? I don't know who to turn to my doctor seems almost annoyed with me with all of these symptoms.

728,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted by Susan on April 21; 1999 at 19:51:11 Hi; I have always suffered with social anxiety in particular situations. I am in college; and the situations which cause me to have excessive anxiety are many. Not only do I experience dread and apprehension at the thought of speaking/participating in class; but my heart also pounds uncontrollably when I am required to speak in public. I started taking Zoloft to control the anxiety (4 weeks ago); but my heart still races--up to 130bpm. My doctor gave me Atenolol(25mg) to take as needed; and I notice a wonderful decrease in the physical symptoms of my anxiety when I take it. Also; I've always been concerned with a generally high pulse rate;It is frequently at 100bpm at rest. My doctor says that it's possibly anxiety related. I've been taking the Atenolol over the last few days when I don't have a perfomance issue because it brings my pulse down into the 80's. I like it because I don't have that sense of awareness about my heart--it's not pounding while I'm just sitting and relaxing. A friend recently told me that beta-blockers can be dangerous; and that I should rethink taking them. Now I'm worried. Have I made a mistake in taking them for non-preformance related heart racing? What are the dangers of Atenolol? Are there specific concerns for taking a beta-blocker on an as-needed basis? Thank you for any information. Susan Posted by HFHS.MD.D.E. on April 27; 1999 at 09:55:19 Dear susan; The two most widely used medications for specific social phobia associated with performance situations are Atenolol and Propranolol. These medications are also indicated for hypertension;cardiac disease and certain types of arrythmias and can help with the physical symptoms (heart racing) in patients with social phobia. The potential side effects include fatigue; nightmares;and bradycardia. If you have undergone a thorough medical evaluation and were given clearance by your primary care physician; then there should be no reason for concern. You might discuss with your physician the reasons for your rapid heart rate; which can be secondary to a number of underlying diseases such as thyroid disease. Atenolol is an appropiate medication for performance anxiety and it seems that it has been of help to you. For patients with generalized social phobia; antidepressants such as Zoloft are the treatment of choice. You have only been on Zoloft for 4 weeks and it might take longer than that for you to start feeling the benefits of this medication. I hope this information was helpful to you. It is however intended for general information only and is not a substitute for a medical consultation.

729,Atenolol+hypertension,I had occasional tachycardia from anxiety before becoming pregnant. During the last 4 months of pregnancy my resting pulse stayed between 90-120 bpm; but I did not have hypertension until the last couple of weeks and it was only 144/85 and 135/91. In the couple of days after giving birth I got a UTI at the hospital and my blood pressure rose to 155/106. I was watched for postpartum pre-eclampsia a few days and released only to be admitted to a closer hospital that evening with a bp of 166/115. My pulse had dropped into the 70-80's after birth; but I began taking Lopressor to lower bp. My cardiologist added Norvasc after the 166/115 trip to the hospital. My bp soon came down to 90/70s. I was told to stop Norvasc and then Lopressor. I watched for a rebound but my bp and pulse were within a normal range for a few weeks without them. I continued to check my bp about every day. One day a relative said something very cruel to me at the exact moment I was taking my bp. My diastolic was 110; but systolic and pulse were normal. My diastolic wouldn't come down so I took Clonidine (as my dr had prescribed for an emergency.) I almost fainted numerous times and was very frightened for my daughter because we were then alone. I never wanted to take it again. My cardiologist told me to take Norvasc again. My bp has been under control since then; but the diastolic always rises dramatically instead of my pulse when there's a lot of stress. My resting pulse has remained lower than 80; sometimes dropping into the 50s. I gave birth 9 months ago. My bp has been dropping into the 90/70s for over a month so I was cutting down the Norvasc slowly. My daughter is recovering from RSV and bronchiolitis. I've had a cold for about a week now. A few days ago I checked my bp and pulse before sleep and they were normal. When I awoke my bp was as expected but my pulse was 104. My pulse has been consistantly elevated since then. I went to an urgent care that evening and my pulse was 111. I had a normal EKG except for tachycardia; but an xray of one of my lungs showed infection. He didn't know if it was viral or bacterial so he gave me a script for a Zpak. I'm feeling much more energy and am drinking a lot of water. My pulse is still really high; mostly when I wake. My bp is still 90/70s when waking; but rises to 104/80(ish) in the evening. My cardiologist is on a month long vacation. I don't know if I should be concerned about the sudden tachycardia or anything I mentioned before. I don't feel sick except feeling my heart beat so fast at rest. I've also lost 4 pounds in the last week. Years ago I was diagnosed with 3 leaky heart valves; but an echo months ago said there were no leaks. I've previously worn a heart monitor that recorded tachycardia and PACs or PVCs but nothing significant to the dr.

Renal clearance/labs wnl. Cholesterol ~220. (Hx recurrent UTI's once a year over 10yr period; culminated in passing of ""grit"" with ultrasound showing renal ?pyramids? and mildly fatty liver. UTI's never recurred after ""grit"" episode. Ouch.) age 40; heart ct for a study showed arteriosclerosis-80% of my age group better than I. age ~41; allergies started after severe exposure to kitty litter dust and a throat sinus ear infection that went untreated too long. Since then tb test +; chest xray neg; possible latex allergy; cat/dog/horse/maple tree allergy; flu shot reaction; mosquito bite reaction; peanut butter reaction; severe reaction to bactrim and balloons-both prev no problem-face like blowfish w balloons; large hives and tiny blood blisters w Bactrim. Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; ""crossed the border to mild asthma"" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the ""stroke."" I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My ""chart"" is 1/2"" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead. I do not agree with the hormone therapy for menopausal women-but I know it offers some cardiovascular protection? Here comes the wacko question-is anyone in the medical field currently prescribing bloodletting for menopausal women?

732,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Catherine F. Baker on September 27; 1998 at 15:38:26: I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending.

737,Atenolol+hypertension,60 yr old male recently started on Furosemide; potassium and Digoxin after having nearly eight months of atrial fibrillation accompanied by persistent coughing; weakness and panting. Should I also be on any other meds. Is it proper to attempt pharmaceutical rythm-conversion after its been so many months at 145-150 with spurts of 195 upon bending or exercise. Isn't the preferred treatment modality these days rate oriented and anti-coagulent oriented? I've been unable to get a test for H. Pylori or heavy metals; yet H. Pylori is causative for some cases of AF and my history of heavy meatal exposure is quite possibly the cause of my persistent hypertension for this past decade; but doctors would not test lead or molybdenum levels or test for pheochromocytoma as possible cause of hypertension.

739,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I am a 32y/o male (165#)and believe that I have some type of problem with my thyroid and am finally investigating this with an endo. All of my test results are not yet back; but what I have so far is: FT4 1.4 (.7-1.7 ref range); FT3 3.1 (2.5-3.9); TSH 1.48 (.5-5.00). The tests that we are waiting on are the antibodies; metephrines; and some other hormone tests that he wanted ran. My symptoms consist of: Anxiety for most of my life with a significant increase about 10 years ago; diagnosed hypertension at about the same time as increased anxiety; irritability; often sleep for many hours at night and am still tired the next day; apathy; easily 'stressed out'; feeling of tightness in my upper chest/lower throat; decreased motivation; constipation; difficulty concentrating with forgetfullness; decreased libido; occassional blurred vision; often difficulty hearing (tv; radio; etc must be turned up louder than most people need). SSRIs for anxiety and dep have done nothing but caused side effects. I am taking 37.5mg of Atenolol for the blood pressure and rapid heart rate. When not on this I also have substantial anxious feelings (increased heart rate; tense muscles; blurred vision; etc). I also get mild chest pains and headaches during exercise when not on the beta blocker. I take Klonipin occassionally for breakthrough anxiety. My question is this: I seem to have both hyper and hypo symptoms mixed. My mother had thyroid problems. Based on my initial tests I appear to be within 'normal'.

743,Atenolol+hypertension,I know that this is a question that has been asked a lot but it still is confusing to me. Do pvc's after exercise mean an increase risk of cardiac problems. I have had a full work up. Holter; electrocardiogram; blood tests and a stress test and everything came out normal except for the pvc's. I had pvc's after the stress test but my doctor didn't seem at all concerned. I also had pvc's on the holtar while at rest. When do pvc's after exercise become a problem? Also; could adrenaline in your system; added to adrenaline caused by exercise result in pvc's after exercise? I am a 22 year old female who is in reasonably good health.

745,Atenolol+hypertension,My cardiologist has put me on a betablocker because I have 18% of PVC's and sometimes SVT (not so much); He says there's a small risk of developing cardiomyopathy if they don't become less. My 24h holter monitor showed that most of the PVC's were during the day. When I'm sleeping I don't have as many. So this is probably why he thinks that my heart will respond well to beta-blockers (i'm a rather anxious person) How soon should my heart starting giving less PVC's; after starting daily beta blocker therapy ?,2014,2015,,Male,,,My cardiologist put betablock I 18 pvc sometim svt much He say there small risk develop cardiomyopathi dont becom less My 24h holter monitor show pvc day when Im sleep I dont mani So probabl think heart respond well betablock im rather anxiou person how soon heart start give less pvc start daili beta blocker therapi
746,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old woman who several months ago had a modified ablation of my sinus node; which subsequently caused me to have sinus pauses of up to 7 seconds and a very slow rate. The diagnosis was sick sinus syndrome and the result a pacemaker. Now I have developed new arrythmias. When I saw my electrophysiologist recently he said I was having episodes of a-fib; as well as wide complex tachycardias. These rhythms are very frequent; almost anytime I stand to do anything. I also have two small children. My Dr.told me I would end up in a-fib all of the time. He said my choices were to have my a-v node ablated and be 100% dependant on the pacemaker; or be on various heart medications including antiarrythmics; which may not solve the prolem. I also have a P.F.O. and I'm on coumadin. He said no matter what I would have to remain on coumadin. Is this because the rhythm would still exist even with the a-v node ablation; and if this is true would it eventually weaken my heart even though I'm not feeling it. My Drs. are wonderful; and I wouldn't trade them for anything. If you have and opinions or insight I would be so grateful. This forum is wonderful. You have helped so many. Thankyou for your time.

747,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 44 year old male; non-smoker; currently on the following meds: Toprol XL 25 mgs and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgs for anxiety-produced hypertension; along with Klonopin 0.25 mgs and Zoloft 25 mgs for Anxiety and Panic Disorder.

748,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type ""A"" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise.

749,Atenolol+hypertension,"Since Jan 06 have had chest pain; sqeezing & burning; occassional sob only during exercise. I have exercised 4-5 days wk for 2 years+. In Jan had thallium stress test; ecg; echo; ekg; holtor; ekg and ct scan to rule out stomach. Stress test stopped after 9 min. due to reaching max heart rate of 151. Bp was normal. Holtor showed heart rate at 195; 20 minutes into workout-with pain episode. Tried numerous meds to control hrt rate-atenolol; verapamil and now on toprol xl 50mg daily + baby asprin.

I may or may not have an episode; but if so; would it be more likely to show what is causing the pain if it is the heart?

751,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm now 38 weeks pregnant; been given the ok to have a vaginal delivery as they STILL after over 3 yrs cannot find the cause of my sinus tachy. It is pretty much like IST but it presented with high bp with normal thyroids etc. So I was put on beta blockers (Atenolol) which worked perfectly for both bp and heart rate in the first year; then in the summer of the second year my heart elevated again but my blood pressure remained normalized. (1st yr Heart rate on beta blockers was about 60 max except with bouts of SVT during anxiety attacks; 2nd yr it went up to between 70 and 80 at rest and has pretty much been like that since; but goes between 90 and 100 after meals). I'm now due to give birth very very soon and I'm terrified! I don't know how much the heart rate goes up by when you give birth but I hope to have an epidural so I don't feel the pain much; I've also heard that it lowers blood pressure so maybe it might help. When I gave birth to my first child I was fine and my heart rate was normal; it was 4 months after delivering him that I developed the sinus tachy with hypertension. Can anyone reassure me with the birth side of it though? Im really worried about the pain and the exertion of the labour. Also; my circulation is pretty poor (it was thought that it might have been the cause of the sinus tachy and hypertension as I developed really bad circulation over a few weeks just before they discovered the heart rate and blood pressure probs). I'm so scared as my local health care professionals don't seem to care; I'm in a small town in the UK and they just keep saying it's ""anxiety"" and that's the only answer I get!

752,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am new to the forum and have been reading many postings. I have been having a problem for the past two months where I experience skipping heart beats. I have had problems with this a few times in the past the first time was just after the birth of my daughter and then again when I was around 35 but at that time I had just lost my father to a heart attack. I've been to the ER several times in the past few months due to my palpitations and keep being told that I am having PVC's and they are not serious and I shouldn't worry. Well; tell that to someone who suffers too with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I take clonopin for the anxiety but lately it's doesn't seem to help. I also take Atenolol; 50mg. daily for the palpitations. It seems to help for about 3 hrs. and then things start up again. I also have hypertension and take atacand; norvasc; and clonidine for it. I am at a loss as to what to do. I've had a stress/echo and a couple of echocardiograms and have been told that things look good. My refraction rate is 60% and I've been told that is wonderful. So; why do I have my heart skipping beats? It is scaring me and then that adds to my anxiety which I am sure doesn't help. These palpitations are making my life miserable and I am afraid to leave the house. My life is very stressful due to my husband who is trying to recover from a serious car accident and was told just a couple of weeks ago that his broken arm isn't healing and he will need another surgey. Also; he lost his job and was forced into early retirement which cost us all our life's savings. Now we live on 60% of what my husband made when he worked. We were not prepared for this as we had 4 more years; we thought; to get our finances in order. I am a retired nurse but the places I worked never offered any kind of retirement plan so what we had in savings was what I was able to put into it from my pay checks. I am sure that the stress I am under isn't helping my heart and with heart disease in my family and having hypertension; I am scared that I am just a heart beat away from a heart attack or stroke; no pun intended. I need HELP!

754,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth on January 18; 1998 at 00:41:55: I am a 47 year old female with chronic hypertension; right-sided CHF; and angina. Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?). I suffer excruciating headaches from them and have been told I have to live with them until we can find the cause of the angina.

755,Atenolol+hypertension,I was just diagnosed with non valvular atrial fibrillation two weeks ago and sent home on amiodarone 200mg/day after I had a chemical conversion with amiodarone. This stuff makes me unable to do anything. I am also taking xarelto 20mg a day.

I am on Norvasc 5mg and 12.5mg hctz both one a day for the hypertension. My issue is that when I do normal activity like picking up around the house I am winded and cannot work very long. I also still have an issue with feeling like I am going to pass out (had these episodes for 6 months before they diagnosed the htn). I am on short term disability but am concerned because I have to drive to work an hour each way. I feel like my doctors are not addressing my issues and I am wondering if there are any suggestions.

757,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doc; as always thanks for allowing me to ask a question. As a 29 year old symptomatic (chest pain; dizziness; nausea) sufferer of frequent PVC's (10-30\min) with mild hypertension for the most part controlled by 12.5 mg Atenolol daily; but with an apprantly stucuturaly normal heart could you offer an insight into the following; 1) My understanding is in general PVC's that are supressed on exercise do not pose a problem; but PVC's NOT supressed on exercise can? A recent stress test I had; when compared to one taken some 18 months earlier showed that whilst my BPM were taken up to about 170 the PVC's were no longer completely supressed; at one point I was getting 15\min with the only notable symptom being dizziness. Though in the computers words no complex ectopy (At rest I can enter long bouts of bigeminy) 2) A lot of respected websites state that in general 6 or more PVC's\min do require treatment; if so; what is the prognosis for one getting the rate of them that I do (as high as 30\min at worst; average 15\min) Can the irritable focus develop over time ie. like water running over stone over the years if you see what I mean. So that sooner or later; a pathway may be completed which could change the situation. 3) In my case; after recording triggers for my PVC's I have noted the following inflame them; Eating food; any food; and taking fluids (hot; cold or normal) Sudden bouts of activity ie. becoming mobile from being at rest.

759,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this ""defect"" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were ""shuddering""); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a ""click""? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid ""leaking"" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in ""slower motion"". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest ""rushes"" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these ""weird"" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol.

761,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. Over the course of a year; I begin have strange tingling sensations in my left arm. Eventually they traveled to my hand; and I would feel pricks in my fingers or see the fleshy part twitch. Later same symptoms traveled to left foot;followed by ankle and heel pain. I have had left sided headaches; primarily in the temple area. The headaches were constant; throbbing; or would feel like a crawling sensation. My current headache has lasted about five weeks. Occassionally; there is twitching around the eyes; and a tingling sensation in the face; particularly near the lips. Also ear pain;tenderness behind ear and jaw. Add to these symptoms general twitches throughout the body; a very stiff feeling left hand and sore left arm;leg pain; achy knees; back pain -upper and lower; shoulder and neck pain; often both sides-more pronounced on the left. I have had a nerve conduction test on the left arm; an MRI of the cervical spine; and a brain MRI; plus consults with a orthopedic Dr (physiatrist?); and a neurologist. All negative results. The neuro Dr. said he saw what might be a small bone spur on the MRI. Some blood work five months ago - CBC normal; thyroid normal but have a history of Graves disease - untreated now but thyroid is still irregularly shaped. Also have hypertension - 25 mg Atenolol. Physiatrist doesn't know what to do with me - do I just let my body heal naturally with rest (he suggested stress) or do I pursue something further? Please advise.

762,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm female; 45 yrs. old with hypertension (treated with 100mg atenolol daily); hashimoto's (synthroid 200mcg); and rheumatoid arthritis. After a sudden loss of sensation in my left armpit which extended to about my elbow; some pretty severe chest pains and a bad headache; I was hospitalized for a few days to run several tests including; brain MRI;ultrasound of neck and chest;stress test; nuclear scan on my chest as well as lots of bloodwork. The conclusion....absolutely nothing. I was given 2 doses of morphine to relieve the chest pain after nitro failed to help and after that the pain subsided.However;4 days later my armpit is still numb.Very numb.In the last 3 months I've noticed some changes in vision(blurred);occasional slurred speech and a clogged feeling in my head and ears. It's actually difficult to hear.And 1 other thing; once in a while my nose will drip what looks like water; I'm not at all congested or coughing nor have I had a cold.

763,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

764,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doc; I have a question about pvc`s. My question is if pvc`s subside;do you still have them occuring.Mine are starting to subside and I was wondering if you still have them even if you don`t feel them. Would they show up on a holter moniter if you didnot feel them occuring? These are new to me; I`ve only had them for a month. They started when I started taking Propranolol 20mg/day for cardilogist suggested high bp[140/90;135/85]. I started to get side effects to the drug so he lowered it. I went to a bp clinic and suggested that I should`nt be on it.[ Suggest lowering salt and weight first to see if that help. Also lower anxiety that I was experiecing from the side effects. I toke the lowered dosage for 13 days when all of a sudden I stared to experiece pvc`s. I went to the cardio and he raised me back up to 20mg/day and after 2 wk they are subsiding to the point that I can barely feel them. I am wondering that if I stop feeling them ; are they still occuring. Can they reoccur? If the bp clinic wants me to stop taking the meds for bp; will the pvc`s reoccur? How much control does 20mg/day have anyway. I am at a total loss as to what to do! I see the blood pressure clinic on Jan. 5 to see what my pressure will be. If they are gone by then do I stop taking the meds for blood pressure or do I continue to take meds for control? of pvc`s if they are gone. Any help in this matter would greatly be apppreciated.

765,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. My questions are . My average heartrate during the morning and afternoon are between 85 to 105 bpm. It usually rises right after eating. From around 5 pm My average heartrate is around 80 bpm and at night it averages between 54 and 62 bpm. I take Cozaar 50mg daily for borderline hypertension; which I would say contolls my B/P quite well . Again my B/P during the day averages between 125/85 to 120/80; but at night my B/P averages around 110/70. I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis; which is usually worse in the morning; Do you think this disease might actually contribute to the these fluctuations in heartrate and B/P. I had an Echo done two and a half years; which showed marginal concentric LVH; which the doctor said was probably due to mild hypertenion; measurements on diastole measured between 10mm to 12mm; I understand the normal range is 8mm to 11mm; Would you suggest another echo at this time or do you think it can wait a bit longer> I had an ECG in Feb this year which was normal. I do suffer from PVCs ; but since I stopped taking atenolol; the PVC are few and far between thank goodness. It slowed my heartrate but aggravated the PVCs. Do you think that beta blockers can aggravate PVCs in some persons; while helping others? And last but not least; Are you aware of data or studies that show or suggest that people who usually complain of PVC ; Pacs and palpitaions are usually shown to actually have stronger and healthier hearts than average?

766,Atenolol+hypertension,"Howdy. Glad I found this site. Description: 41 yr old male. Non-smoker; controlled hypertension; about 40 lbs overweight; large frame man; 6'3"" 275 lbs. I started having a-fib 4 yrs ago; age 37. Did all the test and heart seems normal except a slightly enlarged atrium; maybe due to undiagnosed HBP on my part. Went thru all the meds with no help. Had my first ablation in Austin in Jan. 2002. Went back into a-fib within 2 weeks. Doctor said give it 3 months. Same pattern developed where it would stay in for a week or two and then return to sinus for a week or two. Finally in May of 2003 I went into a-fib 24/7 and been in since. The EP says another ablation has about a 50/50 chance of working. Questions. 1). Should I try another ablation first? 2). With the failed ablation and the enlarged atrium should I just go ahead and put in the pacemaker. The EP says it has the best chance of controlling my life. 3). Does everybody experience consant dizziness and lightheadedness? Is this a symptom of the A-fib or the meds. I am currently on Diltiazm. Lisinopril; Atenolol.

767,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 34 yowf with obesity. 2 years ago suffered a ""panic attack"" but I asked my PCP to exhaust every avenue of my heart because I got very scared.

769,Atenolol+hypertension,I'am a 46 yo male who has had pvcs since age 29. family history of heart disease on maternal side. I'am in good condition and active.I've had elevated BP for years .Have been on atenlol 25mg twice daily for 15 years which manages bp well avg reading 118/65. The atenonlol controlled pvcs for years but when I hit around 40 they came on with a vengence .I've had the usual battery of holters; event monitors; regular and nuclear stress tests and echo's all OK. After reaching the point of intolerance3 years ago I decided to try flecainide 50mg twice daily which stopped the Pvcs cold. At same time I reduced atenolol to 25mg and added a low dose of ACE inhibitor to control BP. Then at my physical last year Blood tests showed low white cell count . Cardio took me off the flecainide and Ace and put my Atenlol back to 50 mg. After three months white cell count back to normal but those cursed pvcs have come back to pre flecainide levels of probably several thousand per day. Cardio mentioned sotolol but I am haesitant and have been living with them and have not tryed the sotolol. I am concerned that these meds are worse than the disease but if I must go back on one is flecanide or sotolol better or is it a toss up? I feel as did my cardio that the ACe was the cause of the white cell depression.Should I get any other tests given my history?The low heart rate from the beta blocker seems to spur the pvcs is it feasible I wean off the beta and try another med for BP control?

771,Atenolol+hypertension,Concerning Treadmill exercise stress testing: 1) Is it a fairly safe test for a person with no known heart disease; but with risk factors such as hypertension; anxiety; and panic disorder; like myself? 2) If a cardiac event were to occur; would it occur at peak exercise; or would it happen during the recovery phase? 3) My last test was in 2001; at age 41....test was negative; and I worked up to 10.1 METS on the Bruce protocol.....I understand that stress tests can determine blockages of 70 % and higher; but I was told by the tech. that I worked hard enough to determine that there was not even a 50 % blockage.....Does that sound correct? 4) I am on Toprol XL 25 mgs a day.....will I be instructed to stop it before testing?

772,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi all; I have a question I hope someone qualified can help with. 31 years ago (at age 6); I started taking Inderal prescribed while suffering from congestive heart failure related to kidney damage (caused by a birth defect that was previously fixed; but obviously the damage remained). The inderal was prescribed as a result of high blood pressure. 17 years ago; I had a kidney transplant. There was no evidence of high blood pressure post transplant. But since I appeared to tolerate the inderal; the doctors decided there was no reason to discontinue it. 7 years ago; after complaining of fatigue and dizziness; a new doctor (I'm in an HMO...I rarely see anyone twice) said we should discontinue the Inderal (then 60mg 2x/day). He said there would be no problem going Cold Turkey. 7 days later; I ended up on the side of the road shaking violently; heart beating ""out of my chest""; fainting and generally thinking I was having a stroke or heart attack. I had never experienced anything so frightening. A trip to the emergency room resulted in the ER doc saying; ""oh; you had a panic attack. Go home; you're fine."" My transplant docs suggested I go back on Inderal; saying it could help the anxiety (no suggestion of weaning; or that going cold turkey might have CAUSED the anxiety etc.). I promptly complied. After reading too much about anxiety off the Internet (believing I had a panic disorder since thats what the ER doc suggested); I then started giving myself panic attacks over dumb stuff. Although the Inderal ""took the edge off""; it was a few years before I finally realized my only real issue was minor sinusitis that can cause headaches/dizziness when driving up mountains or when low pressure systems. I still get minor panicky feelings at times (mostly get clausterphobic a little); but have learned how to ignore then. NOW; I'm trying to get preggers; and the perinatologist wants me off the Inderal for a few reasons. One; she wants to know if I even have hypertension anymore (since we've seen no sign of it since the transplant). Two; at her office today my heart rate was 42 BPM. She had me do some jumping jacks; and then dryly said ""gee; that got you to 45 bpm; nice try."" She thinks it might be the Inderal (go figure; after 31 years!). BTW; these days I'm on 40mg once per day (I exercise in the afternoons; so I skip the morning dose with doc approval in the hope of getting at least a little cardio benefit). My heart rate is usually very low; in the 50s or 60s. After skipping a dose I can get it to 120 running on a treadmill. I occasionally have palpitations; and I believe irregular/skipped heartbeats that have never been caught on an EKG; but generally can be ""cured"" with a good cough. I have had a couple of episodes where for no discernable reason the treadmill will claim my heart rate is 178 when I'm not even moving. And a couple more times where I was kicking butt and the heart rate didn't get about 55. These may or may not have been malfunctions of the equipment; but generally those days I felt something was off. Doctors have refused the ""holter"" device because they say at my age and with my EKG (always normal); they don't see the risk (the only other risk factor I have is that I'm about 40lbs overweight). OKAY; thanks for reading thus far. Here's my question: The doc wants me to start by going down to 20mg 2x/day for a few weeks. Given all of the above; is this pretty safe? What should I look out for? If the anxiety kicks back up; should I just ride it out? I tried asking the doc all this; and she said not to worry so much. Which is great advice; but contrary to my personality. PLUS; since I've been on this darn drug since I was a kid; I don't even know what ""normal"" is. But I want it. It's gotta be better than being a fat zombie who is always cold. :-) Advice appreciated; since there's a lot of wild info on the Net on this topic (IE ""stop inderal and you'll have a heart attack!"" etc. Talk about giving a gal something to worry about!)",2008,2008,,,,,Hi I question I hope someon qualifi help 31 year ago age 6 I start take inder prescrib suffer congest heart failur relat kidney damag caus birth defect previous fix obvious damag remain the inder prescrib result high blood pressur 17 year ago I kidney transplant there evid high blood pressur post transplant but sinc I appear toler inder doctor decid reason discontinu 7 year ago complain fatigu dizzi new doctor Im hmoi rare see anyon twice said discontinu inder 60mg 2xday He said would problem go cold turkey 7 day later I end side road shake violent heart beat chest faint gener think I stroke heart attack I never experienc anyth frighten A trip emerg room result ER doc say oh panic attack Go home your fine My transplant doc suggest I go back inder say could help anxieti suggest wean go cold turkey might caus anxieti etc I promptli compli after read much anxieti internet believ I panic disord sinc that ER doc suggest I start give panic attack dumb stuff although inder took edg year I final realiz real issu minor sinus caus headachesdizzi drive mountain low pressur system I still get minor panicki feel time mostli get clausterphob littl learn ignor now Im tri get pregger perinatologist want inder reason one want know I even hypertens anymor sinc weve seen sign sinc transplant two offic today heart rate 42 bpm she jump jack dryli said gee got 45 bpm nice tri she think might inder go figur 31 year btw day Im 40mg per day I exercis afternoon I skip morn dose doc approv hope get least littl cardio benefit My heart rate usual low 50 60 after skip dose I get 120 run treadmil I occasion palpit I believ irregularskip heartbeat never caught ekg gener cure good cough I coupl episod discern reason treadmil claim heart rate 178 Im even move and coupl time I kick butt heart rate didnt get 55 these may may malfunct equip gener day I felt someth doctor refus holter devic say age ekg alway normal dont see risk risk factor I Im 40lb overweight okay thank read thu far here question the doc want start go 20mg 2xday week given pretti safe what I look If anxieti kick back I ride I tri ask doc said worri much which great advic contrari person plu sinc ive darn drug sinc I kid I dont even know normal but I want it got ta better fat zombi alway cold advic appreci sinc there lot wild info net topic IE stop inder youll heart attack etc talk give gal someth worri
773,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 36 yr old male. Work out 4 days a week. I got an MRA last week for some bad headaches I'd had over the weekend (turned out to be migraine). As an incidental finding on the MRA; my PCP called and said I had a 3 mm aneurysm on the anterior communicating artery. He was very dismissive of this and said this is a very tiny one; asymptomatic and likely has been with me most of my life. He said he wanted to recheck it periodically and that I should not worry. Easier said than done. I've been a wreck; worrying that I have a ticking bomb in my head and everytime I take a jog or play some indoor soccer I'm thinking its either going to grow or possibly rupture. I've stopped weightlifting (I did moderate not very heavy weights) and I've given up my weekly cigar. I don't drink and I take atenolol for borderline hypertension. I've had nobody in my family going back several generations ever die of stroke or have an aneurys rupture. My doc senses my anxiety over this and has told me to see a neurosurgeon here in Cincinnati to have an expert evaluate it. He still absolutely thinks surgery is not adivsed at this time and that periodic observation is the wisest choice. I'm quite worried that a neuro""surgeon"" is going to want to operate. My other concern is that watching and waiting may require me to stop all cardio exercise and sport which is my main stress relief and joy in life. Based on the info I've provided what is your take on this type of small aneurysm finding and your take on what should be done (watch and wait or operate?); limitations on actitivies?

779,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia. Lately; I've been experiencing severe nausea; dizziness; fatigue; weakness; and headaches whenever I exercise; which is a mixture of walking and weight training. Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10""); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem?

780,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi; all - I am currently on 2 mg. diazapam (valium) and 5 mg. celexa (half a 10 mg. pill). I just started the celexa about 3 weeks ago; and have been on an even lower dose (working up frm 1/4 to half to 3/4 to 2 mg last month - my own way - I was prescribed the 2 mg.). Prior to the valium; I was on Ativan for about 2 months. My understanding from my psychiatrist is that the 'plan' is up the celexa (although I don't know how far - I have dysthymia and ocd; so I hear...) and at some point come off the valium. I also have hypertension; so take atenolol and lisinopril and a baby asprin each day. I'm 59 years old. Anyway; I see my primary care doc once a month - he is a cool old-school guy; who used to see me primarily for 'reassurance' for various anxiety / ocd issues until he decided I needed a psychiatrist to give me meds. He sent me to a colleague; who has me on these meds. Those close to me - my husband; therapist and a friend who is a former RN and who herself takes lexapro; all say I am doing 'much better' than I was. When I started posting here; I could barely eat solid food - mashed potatoes were difficult. Now; I have made some real improvement (hamburger; cut up; soft veg; and so on); although I'm not yet where I need to be (can't eat chicken; and so on.). When I saw my primary care guy yesterday; I saw I'd gained 5 lbs. OMG! I want to blame the meds but the reality is as I can eat stuff; I grab all the things that are bad for me; like donuts; cakes; chips and mex food. In any event; 5 lbs in one month seems high. My BP was also up but the doc wasn't concerned so much. He thought I might ask the psych to 'cut back' on the valium; as I complain of being 'lazy' and 'tired.' I will have been on some sort of valium in any case since February; albeit at a low dose. He also suggested asking to cut back on the celexa - to 2 mg. Huh? My psych said I wouldn't feel anything on 5 mg. I do feel somewhat tired; but I really doubt she's going to go down to 2 mg. I think my primary care doc's focus was to get me to a point where I could eat again. The psych seems to be looking at things differently - telling me I might have to take meds for my ocd 'for the rest of my life.' I am just starting the process of trying to get ON SSRI's; not off them. Aside from some nausea and tiredness / apathy; no big deal on the side effects. But I am confused. Do I try to get OFF this stuff now? If I do; will I still be able to eat? Will folks think I'm 'better?' I'm inclined to think my success is from the meds; and that if I go off; it won't be long before I'm back to square 1. I don't want to be; but why would my primary care suggest I cut back on such low doses? I serously doubt my psych would consider lowering anything at this point; I""m almost afraid to ask. I hate to bring up that my primary care doc suggested it; as they are colleagues at the same clinic - and well; in a showdown; you know who gets thrown under the bus - and it aint either of them. One or the other will say I didn't understand or whatall; just to save face... at least that's how that stuff usuall works. Ok; any one have any ideas on what i can do here? How can I discuss this w/ my psych diplomatically? She's a bit of a diva; but she seems to be very smart and I like her. I like my primary care doc too; though; and that's the problem. They both seem to have divergent opinions. As I see my psych next week; I need input asap - thanks.

782,Atenolol+hypertension,Has anyone who suffers from Hypothyroidism have any problems with their blood pressure being too low? I have read a lot of sites that have covered hypothyroidism and HIGH blood pressure. But I do not now nor have I ever had High Blood pressure. On an average I run around 90/70 but there are times when I can feel my blood pressure dropping and when I do it is always with the following symptoms: I just want to sleep; no matter how much work there is still to be done; and I get a little foggy in my brain. Over time I learned to test my blood pressure when I started to feel that way. Two weeks ago I was feeling that way and tested it at the local grocery store and I was 97/58 with a normal pulse rate. I have asked Dr's repeatedly how low is to low and get told nothing usually. Out of sheer desperation I asked the local pharmacist for suggestions on what to do when I felt that way. The answer was shockingly simple and yet has at least partially helped me out. That answer was get some Gatorade and drink it. She said it was the salt and electrolytes that I was needing. It's not a cure but it does seem to help me in any case.

783,Atenolol+hypertension,I am having palpitations occasionally that feel so very forceful. They cause me to stop what I am doing immediately and I obsess about them for hours afterword. I have a history of anxiety and panic and depression. I am currently taking lamictal and lexapro with atenolol for high blood pressure and anxiety reduction. I have been diagnosed with hypertension and anxiety and depression. I had a full cardiac work up with chemical stress test; echocardiogram; bloodwork; nuclear medicine heart exam; and my cardiologist said I was fine. This work up was around 2 years ago. The only thing is that my C-reactive protein is elevated. I believe it is in the 8 range when anything >3 is considered high. I do not remember the unit of measurement with that. My cholesterol is slightly elevated from what I hear but it is still within normal limits and as such no medication has been prescribed. I have GERD and I am taking prilosec but this was diagnosed only recently and the palpitations existed prior to that problem. I am a 28 year old morbidly obese male. I am in the process of continuing to lose weight as I am 5'11 and 345 pounds. Even though they say I am ok whenever I have those terrible palpitations I am just so fearful that the end is near.

It was learned via my remarkable dermatologist who noticed that I was getting a butterfly rash on my face that prompted him to test me for this disease. This type of rash is commonly found on people with lupus. Please ask your physician's to check your ANA levels; to confirm if your pin-pricking and burning sensations are in relation to lupus like mines!! My symptoms had ceased almost immediately after being removed from the medication; but I had already developed this disease. PLEASE; don't delay getting this blood test done; because if you have lupus and it remains untreated-- it can affect your organs (heart; kidneys; brain) which can become severe; and even deadly!! Also; my lupus was drug-induced by a long-term seizure medication that I was prescribed for a number of years. There are tons of medications; to include hypertension meds like (Atenolol); diuretics (HTCZ); and anti-inflammatories (Naproxen) that can induce lupus as well! Check out your meds too! Good luck to each of you; because these symptoms are truly annoying; and can affect the quality of ones life tremendously!!!,2011,2011,,,,,for experienc andor suffer pinprick burn sensat year like I diagnos lupu decemb 2010 It learn via remark dermatologist notic I get butterfli rash face prompt test diseas thi type rash commonli found peopl lupu pleas ask physician check ana level confirm pinprick burn sensat relat lupu like mine My symptom ceas almost immedi remov medic I alreadi develop diseas pleas dont delay get blood test done lupu remain untreat affect organ heart kidney brain becom sever even deadli also lupu druginduc longterm seizur medic I prescrib number year there ton medic includ hypertens med like atenolol diuret htcz antiinflammatori naproxen induc lupu well check med good luck symptom truli annoy affect qualiti one life tremend
786,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 32 yr female/ 5'3"" 200 lbs/ overweight /non-smoker/ hypothyroidism/ take 90 Armour / mild hypertension/ 50 atenolol About six weeks ago; I was shoveling snow and felt a tiny 5 second stabbing pain in the upper left center of my chest. then i resumed shoveling and was fine. The next several days my shoulder and left arm were very sore and almost like an icy/ hot feeling all over that arm. I thought I had pulled my shoulder blade or something. I was seen by a chiropractor. He took my BP; it was normal. Took my pulse; it was normal. He adjusted me. That pain lessened after a couple of days. However; I continued to feel some slight chest; shoulder; back and arm pain. I experience some mild stabbing/ burning in my left arm pit and shoulder blade- almost like it wraps around my left breast and shoulder. Also; I have been experiencing more ""wet"" belching than normal for the last month; on and off since this occurred. I did NOT experience dizziness or lightheadedness. I have not really been short of breath; except when I start to be anxious and panic about it. Sometimes I feel fine; and other times; I feel this pain. It is aggravating. It is the worst at night. I was supposed to have a surgery; so after about a month of on and off pain; I had blood work and a pre-op EKG. It came back abnormal. It scared the dickens out of me; and i panicked in the middle of the night (the same day i recieved the results) and ended up going to the ER. The ER doc rain blook work and looked at my chest xray and did two more EKGs; with similar abnormal results-- basically all saying i had possible av block; abnormal twaves; and possible enlargment of right and left atriums. The ER doc said I had not had a heart attack and I was fine; just to follow up with a stress test to get clearance for my surgery. I was referred for a nuclear stress test. My baseline EKG at the stress test said ""cannot rule out anterior infarct"".... but the imaging came back normal. In fact; the stress test went well; reaching heart rate of 160 in 11 minutes. The cardiologist said the nuclear stress test came back normal with ""excellent functionality and no cause for alarm"". The cardiologist said that my heart was fine and everything looked good and the EKG readings often come back as ""false positives"" on young women so I shouldn't worry. After an exam; he said my heart ""sounded"" good. My blood panel was good. My chest xray was good. He said though he can't promise I will never have a heart attack that today my ""ticker's just fine"". No reason for the chest pain was explained or even mentioned by the cardiologist. He only said to exercise more often as a preventative because of my family history (dad had two heart attacks at 50; but he was a very heavy smoker). I have been exercising every day for the last week; running on the treadmill for over a mile and ballroom dancing three times per week for and hour. I do not experience chest pains during exercise- actually it generally feels a little better during exercise. I'm am still nervous because I know not all nuclear stress tests are 100% accurate. Should I ask for more tests? The cardiologist indicated he did not even need to see me for any type of follow up....

787,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am writing to try to get some information on what might be happening to my partner who experiences significant mood swings/behavioral changes at times. He refuses to go to the doctor so I am wondering if someone here can help me. First some information on his background and condition: Caucasian Male 39 yrs old. 30 Lbs overweight Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tachycardia Former methamphetamine user (used for many years; but has been clean for 10+ yrs.) Binge drinker (1 or 2 times a week) Current medications: Lisinopril (Blood Pressure) Atenolol (Heart Rate) Valium (for anxiety) Insulin injections (Humulin R; N) Basically; his behavior can go from 'normal' (calm; not agitated; clear-headed; etc.) to what I am calling ""Altered"" in a matter of minutes. During these episodes his behavior will deteriorate where he will gradually start acting like he is intoxicated; even though he has not been drinking. It will begin with slight mood changes and speech changes (such as mild slurring; searching for the correct word; etc.). General mood will be happy and sometimes giddy; unless he becomes agitated by something; which tends to happen very easily. If he becomes agitated or angry then his mood will further decline to belligerent or even violent behavior. He will say hurtful things intentionally and become verbally abusive. This negative mood shift does not always happen. In either case; it seems the only way for him to return to 'normal' is to sleep for 6+ hours. It seems like mentally stressful situations may bring this on; although I have also seen it happen after heavy meals. His Diabetes is not well controlled; and he often has high blood sugar spikes. He also does not take his other medications exactly as prescribed; instead choosing to take them whenever he remembers. He often takes 2 Valium at once; 1 time a day instead of 1 every 12 hours. Sometimes he skips a day.

788,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doctor; One of the major troubling symptoms I have been having for the last few years has been breathing difficulties. I am always gasping for breath or feel like I am suffocating. I also have associated jaw locking and muscle spasms especially from the chest upwards. I was always told that it was just anxiety but none of the treatments for anxiety had worked. In fact the breathing techniques my clinical psycologists teach (I have seen 3 ) make me more suffocated. Had been to neurologist and cardiologists for other issues which have been resolved and even had a brain MRI. Now I had been told by my doctor that I am an asthmatic since I had bronchitis when young. But apparently after doing some tests (spirometry??); he mentioned I did not have asthma symptoms. Because of the muscle spasms I thought it had to be then muscular skeletal. I don't have any coughs; nor wheezing and don't have respiratory infections too often either. I am 47 years old - female. My doctor still gave me atenolol for the anxiety and the white coat effect hypertension but I felt more shortness of breath and in fact my blood pressure was higher when I felt panicked and very short of breath. But the last 2 days I applied almost a kind of breathing similar to pursed lip ; where I feel a kind of back pressure in my throat and I can breathe better; there is less muscle spasms/tightness and my posture even is a bit better and I even slept better. I am not a smoker and it is unlikely I have any lung problems . Can a breathing dysfunction cause COPD symptoms and anxiety and tetany like symptoms? I consulted a sleep specialist over these symptoms. He mentioned I did not have typical apnea symptoms but that my throat was very restricted and my jaw was retracted. I am due for the sleep study in 2 months. Please help with some suggestions how to move forward?

789,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 48 yr old female who has been diagnosed with dextrocardia. As far as I know; I've had this condition all of my life and it hasn't affected me in any way. Recently I've begun to have ""episodes"" that have not been diagnosed at this time. It starts with an ache in the back of my throat and tightening of the chest follows. I feel like I have to take deep breaths to come out of it. The episodes last about a minute and toward the end I have tingling in my hands. I tried not to take deep breaths one time and the back of my head felt like it was going to explode. It's very frightening when It happens and just want to understand what is going on. I have been treated for Acid Reflux but the meds didn't do any good. I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure only when exercising. While I'm at rest my blood pressure is normal. Could the blood pressure be a contributing factor to these episodes? My family physician just started me on 25 mg a day of Atenolol for the blood pressure so I'm not sure yet if this will help or not. I'm afraid that I might have an episode and will not be able to come out of it. These episodes happen randomly; I might go a week without incident or I might have 10 episodes in one day. It wakes me up at night while I'm sleeping and I have to sit on the side of the bed until I'm able to breathe normally. Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

791,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26 year old male. The past several months I've been having an issue when standing up. About 10-20 seconds after standing up my heart rate increases for about 5 seconds before settling down. During those 5 seconds I also hear blood rushing through my head pretty loudly and it feels like it is uncomfortable to stay upright. After a few seconds it goes away and I am totally fine. This sensation is much worse at night and almost unnoticeable during the morning.. Upon taking my blood pressure; the systolic pressure seems to go up somewhat (~10 mmHG). That too settles down once it passes; though it may just be flukes in readings..I am unsure. I have been taking atenolol 25mg for a few years now; but I've cut the pill in half and have been on that for close to 6 weeks now. No significant rise in BP has been documented as a result. I have read it could be POTS; orthostatic hypertension or other arrhythmia; and I've read it could be a valve leak; But I don't think so as it is so quick to pass. I have pretty crippling anxiety; and over the past couple weeks I randomly become anxious about my heart. (I had an episode close to 5 years ago where I went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack; when it was just an anxiety attack). I had a stress test; echocardiogram and I even wore a heart monitor. Aside from being diagnosed with PVCs; everything came back fine. I had these tests done because my father had a heart attack when he was 25 and triple bypass in his early 30s; so it needed to be ruled out. I'm thinking a lot of it is my anxiety; but not all of it. The increase in heart rate was happening before my anxiety was triggered and I didn't think much of it. I am a full time student; currently unemployed and living off of student loans. So if I wanted to get these tests done again I would be paying out of pocket. Researching the cost of these tests show that I won't be able to afford even one. I'm afraid and worried and it has been affecting my daily life for the past two weeks. Any insight will help.,2015,2015,,Male,,,Hi Im 26 year old male the past sever month ive issu stand about 1020 second stand heart rate increas 5 second settl dure 5 second I also hear blood rush head pretti loudli feel like uncomfort stay upright after second goe away I total fine thi sensat much wors night almost unnotic morn upon take blood pressur systol pressur seem go somewhat 10 mmhg that settl pass though may fluke readingsi unsur I take atenolol 25mg year ive cut pill half close 6 week No signific rise BP document result I read could pot orthostat hypertens arrhythmia ive read could valv leak but I dont think quick pass I pretti crippl anxieti past coupl week I randomli becom anxiou heart I episod close 5 year ago I went ER I thought I heart attack anxieti attack I stress test echocardiogram I even wore heart monitor asid diagnos pvc everyth came back fine I test done father heart attack 25 tripl bypass earli 30 need rule Im think lot anxieti the increas heart rate happen anxieti trigger I didnt think much I full time student current unemploy live student loan So I want get test done I would pay pocket research cost test show I wont abl afford even one Im afraid worri affect daili life past two week ani insight help
792,Atenolol+hypertension,I have two aneurysms (ascending aortic; and pulmonary) that are under the watchful care of a cardiologist. Recently I have begun to have some almost daily sharp headaches; as the result of orgasm. Does having an aneurysm or two in one location of the body indicate that you are prone to them; and should I see a doctor about the headaches I'm having? They are pretty bad when they kick up; and have had the same kind of headache without additional 'inducement'. I had unchecked hypertension for many years; possibly my entire life up until the first detection of the aortic aneurysm at which time I was put on atenolol. I've seen some references to one being prone to them; and thus they can form anywhere; and my concern is that I may have a a cerebral aneurysm and not know it; outside of the severe headaches I mentioned.

799,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on April 20; 1998 at 13:31:17: In Reply to: High Blood Pressure posted by Vila Hall Sr. on April 19; 1998 at 23:06:39: I have been diagnosed as having high blood pressure; but it is only high when I am at the doctors office. I have told two doctors that it is never high any other time. They insist it is and have proscribed fosinopril and atenolol; alsoterazosin which I had to quit taking because of some side effects. I am 77 years old and in the best of health except for arthritis. Am never sick; not even a headache. Can work hard without getting fatigued and am a little overweight. My blood pressure away from the doctors office is usually around 140/70; but at the office is 170/80. My question is; do I have high blood pressure And must I have to take this medicine? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Vila: High blood pressure is a leading cause of strokes. It can also cause heart attacks; kidney failure; and vision problems. New research suggests that it may contribute to dementia and cognitive loss in the elderly. Even mild degrees of high blood pressure can lead to problems over time. One of the problems with high blood pressure is that it can take years for the damage to become evident. All that time you may have no symptoms. That is why high blood pressure is sometimes called the ""silent killer."" Some people have ""white coat hypertension;"" which means that their blood pressure is normal except when they are in the doctors office. While this is less of a problem than sustained high blood pressure; it is still abnormal. Whether to treat white coat hypertension with medications is a trickier issue. At a minimum; patients with white coat hypertension should be advised to switch to a low salt diet; to start exercising regularly; and to lose weight if obese. These simple measures are sometimes enough. If someone is overweight; sometimes even a few pounds of weight loss can suffice. If the blood pressure remains elevated (even if only in the doctors office); many cardiologists would elect to start medications; especially if the blood pressure is very high.

800,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm taking 10 mg of Propanolol 2 times a day for anxiety related tachycardia. I take that dose since a while now. At first I was doing ok; the Propranolol was able to reduce my heart rate in the 60's but since 1 month I experience very fast heart rate; pounding heart beat; some skip heart beat; I can feel and see my shirt moving while my heart is beating. Also my blood pressure is normal to low...110/65 to 100/55. I experience this all the time now. Is it because the Inderal (propranolol) stop working on me? If it's the case; why I continue to have the hypertensive effect of the Inderal but not the heart rate reduction? I ask my Cardio Doc but he just switch me to the Lopressor and had the same problem with that med either... Someone can explain how it's possible to have a normal to low blood pressure with a pounding heart rate and a fast heart rate? I was also use to have orthostatic hypotension shortly after my Inderal dosage was increase but now I dont have it.

801,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having ""unexplained"" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always ""pounding;"" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1"" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

802,Atenolol+hypertension,"Can anyone shed some light on Hyperbeta adrenergic syndrome. I have been suffering from constant sinus tachycardia and with it high bp. I have undergone extensive tests (including thyroids) and they can't find a cause; but it all kicked off after giving birth; I read an archive post on here from a lady called Roberta; she said her daughter had the same symptoms as me even down to the severe weight loss and that it was all after the birth; it stated that she had sinus tachy; with it high bp and that she had become very thin and weak like myself. I read the posting on medhelp.com about a woman who's daughter of the same age as me had it in 1999 but there was not much mention of the condition of hyperbeta blah blah. On wikipedia it is related to post traumatic stress. I have adrenalin racing round me all the time; and am on beta blockers and have been prescribed SSRI's also. I developed a fear of giving birth; then of course; I had to give birth; I was relieved after the birth but there was so much adrenalin whooshing round me that I literally could not sleep at all for three days after the birth; I had; on the first night conditioned myself not to sleep after the birth. After that I started sleeping normally; but of course; was using babycentre forums to chat to other mums who had been supporting me and I supporting them through our pregnancies. Then... one of the Mums got a nasty infection a few weeks after the birth; followed by another. Then I got a tooth infection and had gone from fear of birth; to fear of infections. I then stopped eating - fear of getting more food stuck down the gap where my wisdom tooth has not quite come through properly which has caused 5 infections through the pregnancy and that one after the birth. I tried to eat on the other side but was so nervous that I couldn't swallow properly. I would have literally a mouthful a night. As well as that I then noticed I had got a womb infection like my friends and was ""crapping myself"" about it. I was convinced it was bad; because I had looked up the name of the infection and saw what its complications were; I was ULTIMATELY terrified! It was a nasty one. I was given antibiotics and then took another swab test which said it was all clear. But I was not convinced; I had developed other symptoms and was convinced it had become a secondary infection. I noticed I was getting petechaie; flushing; my blood pressure was going up; and more and more symptoms arose. I was getting severe pain in my pelvic area and was in and out of the doctor's on a daily basis in sheer panic. I then caught a virus that was going round; shortly after I developed a painful rash on my legs; then the rash disappeared but I felt weak and drained. I was still not eating. I had not noticed that I had lost weight by this point. I then noticed my skin had gone very pale and transparent; I could see all my veins; I felt weak; my breathing was weak. Something; to me; was very wrong. I felt like my muscles were wasting. I then caught another virus; a bad one this time; it was sinusitis with a throat thing. I could not breathe properly. I had also been crying a lot with anxiety. One night I laid on the bed coughing and my lungs were literally spasming; forcing breath out; it was terrifiying. I could feel the congestion daily working its way down onto my chest. I had earache and my sinuses were heavy. I could feel this tight band around my middle all day one day. My mouth was full of sores when I had tried to eat. I was in a mess. I literally one night ran down to the doctors in fear and when he checked my bp and heart rate he immediately admitted me because they were both sky high. Only to be told after lots of blood tests and chest x ray that my problem was psychiatric! The heart rate never calmed down; I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia; I then got lots of pvcs and pacs etc... and developed an arrhythmia also. I was referred to the cardiologist who said it was stress but has booked me for an echo. Meanwhile my symptoms got worse; I noticed the weight loss and I eventually weighed myself; I was 8 stone; from 10 and a half stone in 2 months! I had lost all my body fat/muscle mass. I was bony; pale and my veins were popping up all the time. I had gone greyish white in colour; dark circles under my eyes. I was back in and out of the doctor's convinced it was physical; my fingernails went bluish; I developed fungal infections in my toenails and feet; I was in pain all of the time in my joints (my joints even went red). I was tested for everything and tests came back normal each time. (thyroids; blood counts; blood cultures; serum levels; electrolytes; esr; ACE; PTH; glucose; you name it) the only levels that have been out recently are my FSH and LH which are both elevated but that can happen in a normal cycle and I was due my period when I had them done so they have to be repeated. I have since developed neurological symptoms and I am very scared; I have asked for an MRI but have been refused. (I was granted a referral recently by another doctor but my doctor put a stop to it; insisting it is purely psychiatric). I also have suspected ME which doesn't help. So; after babbling on like that (sorry); is there a chance that it actually IS psychiatric? Has my living in constant fear caused this? Is my adrenalin whooshing round all day every day? Before birth; my normal bp was 100/60 the highest it went was 110/60. It has always been like that. Now; on the beta blockers; it's 130/80!

803,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently have been awakening at night with an overwhelming feeling of adrenaline rushing through my body then my heart begins to race. I have seen a cardiologist and was put through an excercise stress echo test. All was fine my heart rate reached 180 bpm and was sinus tach. No blockages were found and test was normal; EKG was also normal. I'am currently wearing a 30 day event monitor and at present the racing heart has been showing up as PAT's with rates up to 176 bpm. My cardiologist said that he would put me on the beta blocker 100mg Toprol XL to help alleviate this. The only problem is that I'am a 35yo female 145lbs no hx of high cholesterol; b/p normally runs 100/60 and at times even lower than this. My resting heart rate is usually 68-72 bpm. I'am an LPN and I'm currently working on getting my RN in school; my brother was recently diagnosed with Lung Cancer and just 3 weeks ago my 52yo sister died suddenly. Not to mention I am a mother of 2 ages 4 and 7. I have explained this to my Cardiologist and he still says that it is the PAT's that are causing my anxiety not my anxiety causing the PAT's. I'm concerned about taking medication that will lower my B/P more than it already is. This is begining to effect my life drastically. I'm waking up at night often as many as 4x with my heart pounding; feeling breathless; and shaking all over. It is starting to effect my daily life to the point that I shake much of the time during the day. I have a constant feeling of anxiety and adrenaline jolts.

804,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 22 year old male and I need some advice. Suddenly on November 14; 2007; My heart rate spiked through the roof while showering; previous to that my heart rate was elevated for an hour or so. For the last year and a half I've had bouts with sporadic tachycardia and palpitations; I noticed it mostly after eating. The more I ate it seemed worse. Anyways getting back to this. When I even move around a bit (even lying down) my heart rate elevates rapidly and when I stand up it goes up to about 160+. I was in the trauma unit of my local hospital a few weeks ago as my heart rate would not go below 120 for about 2 hours. I am on 25mg Atenolol 2x/day right now for a total of 50mg; and it has helped but the symptoms breakthrough after anywhere from 2-8 hours. It varies. I'm also on 20mg of Paxil and have been for about 8 months and 2mg of Lorazepam (Ativan). I have had about a dozen ECG's and echocardiagram a holter monitor and everything is fine on them. I (like an idiot) stopped paxil abruptly about 2-3 months ago because I didn't want to be on it anymore; and I started getting bad palpitations. I went back on it and the palpitations settled down but came back after about a week or so; and then everything has seemed to go downhill after that. Any ideas on what is causing this? Like I said when I wasn't on Atenolol when I would even move a little my heart would go up considerably; and if I tried to stand up and walk around; it went to 160+ beats. I get hypertension with it as well; but feel weak. It is a little better with the Atenolol though. I'm just extremely worried and want to know if this will go away or what. I'm scared out of my mind as when there is no pills to at least help a bit; it completely disables me.,2007,2007,21.0,Male,,,Hi Im 22 year old male I need advic suddenli novemb 14 2007 My heart rate spike roof shower previou heart rate elev hour for last year half ive bout sporad tachycardia palpit I notic mostli eat the I ate seem wors anyway get back when I even move around bit even lie heart rate elev rapidli I stand goe 160 I trauma unit local hospit week ago heart rate would go 120 2 hour I 25mg atenolol 2xday right total 50mg help symptom breakthrough anywher 28 hour It vari Im also 20mg paxil 8 month 2mg lorazepam ativan I dozen ecg echocardiagram holter monitor everyth fine I like idiot stop paxil abruptli 23 month ago I didnt want anymor I start get bad palpit I went back palpit settl came back week everyth seem go downhil ani idea caus like I said I wasnt atenolol I would even move littl heart would go consider I tri stand walk around went 160 beat I get hypertens well feel weak It littl better atenolol though Im extrem worri want know go away Im scare mind pill least help bit complet disabl
805,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi All; I am a 28 year old male; very active until onset of arrhythmia 2 years ago. I noticed arrhythmia 2 years ago after long nights of drinking; coffee during day and 100 hour work weeks (wall street). My heart would 'double' it's beats for 30 seconds and then go back to normal. I didn't think much of it at the time but then one morning after a heavy drinking session I had a terrible episode where I had a bunch of dropped and coupled beats in chaotic rhythm of no real organization that turned into a very rapid tachycardia (250-300bpm) for 3-5 minutes. Never any pain/dizzyness other than what I would expect from severe mental distress (and I've had a terrible time convincing the non-MD's that it's NOT a panic attack..I have several MD's in my family and I know the difference). After a few more episodes during exercize; I went in and saw a doc that said I'd be fine. I didn't trust him so went for a second opinion to Dr. Anthony Aizer at NYU. He is amazingly diligent; patient and willing to walk you through your issues. They did find some 'likely benign' issues and performed a Cavotricuspid Isthmus ablation to cure the CVNRT (made the pathway singular to cure the circuitous problem that made me go into rapid heart rhythm) and found an area that could be generating spontaneous pulses but since they had me on the table for 9 hours; decided to leave it for another day. Things were pretty good for a while but I never did get back to exercizing as I would often have skipped beats as I came down from 150bpm to 120bpm. No more drinking alcohol. But then last week; after a lot of stress and coffee the previous month; I got a bunch of extra or dropped beats; I'm guessing PVCs (feels like a 'ka-chunk' in my chest) a few times a minute; maybe 100 times per hour. It really distresses me and I immediately jump up; get my shoes on and head for the er. I've been admitted once and have slept in the waiting room 3 times in the past week. Seems the only way I can get to sleep is to take 50mil benzodiazapine and wait until I'm so exhausted that I don't care if my next beat is my last. And this is a circuitous feedback loop: tired at work > poor performance > lose money > get angry > cant relax > have pvc > get tired > tired at work etc... No doubt that there is a psychological element but I know it's also largly physiological. And I've gotten good at calming myself down but even when I'm very relaxed I get them. I have had no (knock on wood) pvc's tonight as Doc Aizer perscribed some Atenolol. I can usually feel when the jump is going to come (I'm only guessing that it's a pvc) and think it definitely has something to do with adrenal uptake. I can feel a certain undescribable 'queezyness' in my chest sometimes for a split second before as if a chemical were injected (and this is from no aparent stimulus) and then get the jumped beat. I can feel the electricity swallowing my heart muscle in a quick gulp. Can anyone put my mind to ease that this is likely nothing serious? Logically; I should not worry. I have one of the best electrophysiologists in the country on my case and he's explored the inside of my heart in finest detail; has done every test; and knows what is most likely wrong. But I had a non-biological uncle who died at 22 of sudden cardiac death and cause was never found (and his father was a top sergeon who made sure of a proper autopsy). I just don't quite understand what makes the beats keep coming and am scared that they will spontaneously stop all together or that they'll go into overdrive or that one pvc will turn into a long strand. It's sort of comical when the er doc says ""you won't need to come back unless you pass out"" and it's that assymetry of outcomes that worries me: either its ok or we'll know it's not because you'll be dead. And this is where it's definitely a mind block for me: it's almost like I have PTSD from the whole experience. Do people die from these skipped beats? I'm sure there are a few unsolved cases but what generally makes structurally healthy people die from arrhythmia other than drugs? Thanks for any advice; opinion or comment.

806,Atenolol+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?",2009,2009,,Female,,,medic histori My mom age 71live singapor histori hypertens she hospit 509 drug hypertens medic methyldopa induc cholestasi prescrib new Dr while hospit diagnos atrial fibril 2de result normal LV size systol function No rwma lvef 59 normal pasp 26mmhg trivial aortic tricuspid regurig aspirin 100 mg prescrib ecg attach her hospit chest apsit result the heart size accur assess appear enlarg there mild promin hilar vessel suggest mild congest she recruit warfarin vs apixaban doubl blind clinic trial start treatment aug4 2009 We later found warfarin w dosag unknown us 14 day wafarin treatment fell caus fall unknown accord friend walk right next mom stop walk forward drop floor hit back head she consciou mobil initi repeat brain CT scan hospit day due drop gcn the second CT scan shown much larger bleed due blood thin effect warfarin she becam semiconsci loss sens control left side CT brain result 1 acut subarachnoid subdur haemorrhag 2 pneumocephalu occipit bone fractur left haemotympanum blood product sphenoid sinu 3 haemorrhag contus left occipit lobe old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleu her inr 35 due warfarin luckili extens rehab abl regain 90 physic mental abil she discharg 911 the blood test sept 14 visit cardiologist haematolog within rang platelet clump note biochemistri non fast within rang non clinic signific On follow visit neurologist leg check neurologist indic doe tendenc embol and brain CT scan done sept discharg hospit show blood clot brain almost gone unlik alzheim her BP 11012080 rang she 3 BP medic one stomach 1 amlodipin besil 10 mg 2 lisinopril 20 mg3 atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 20 mg stomach On 928 cardiologist resum warfarin 1 mgday start despit request leav trial switch aspirin when request echocardiogram dr respons WE need TO DO A transesophag echocardiogram A mildli invas procedur TO detect clot reliabl which IS not feasibl howev even IF NO clot wa seen the risk for clot format IS still present do AN echocardiogram will not chang manag with question 1 given patient neardeath bleed safe continu bloodthin therapi We famili favor use aspirin therapi AF mitig risk thromboembol oppos continu warfarin but given near death brainble use warfarin wise use ani blood thinner even low dose aspirin 2 should patient echocardiogram determin natur extent clot ismay form due AF what type echocardiogram transthorac transesophag what test see upper chamber mother heart help us determin extent build clot therefor help us form evalu true risk profil embol event due AF
807,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted by NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia. Lately; I've been experiencing severe nausea; dizziness; fatigue; weakness; and headaches whenever I exercise; which is a mixture of walking and weight training. Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10""); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem? Or am I just turning into a medical basket case? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 11; 1999 at 10:37:10 Dear NCW You are not a medical basket case. If your blood pressure is 150/100 when you are just sitting around; it is probably much higher when you exercise and especially high when you are weight lifting. Any heavy weight lifting (or exercise) is probably a very bad idea until your blood pressure is under better control. You should also see a specialist in hypertension - either a cardiologist or a nephrologist (kidney doctor) to be evaluated for certain uncommon disorders that can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure); but can be cured. This testing involves blood tests and perhaps a kidney ultrasound. I think this would be very important. Furthermore; once your blood pressure is under better control; if you symptoms on exercise persist; you should be evaluated for coronary artery disease. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to write back. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Specific questions should be addressed to your own doctor.

Posted by NCW on June 15; 1999 at 15:07:15 I've been tested for pheochromocytoma; carcinoids; heart problems; and had a renogram in January. What kind of testing would a nephrologist add? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 16; 1999 at 16:58:36 Dear NCW I did not realize that you already had an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension. A nephrology evaluation would not add anything at this point. Some causes of hypertension that are overlooked are alcohol and tobacco use; illicit drug use; steroid use; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (ibuprofen). I hope this has been useful.

809,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm dealing with tachycardia arrhytmia since more than 2 years now. My Cardilogist at first said it was dysautonomia and POTS and blame also my severe anxiety and was put on a beta blocker; propranolol 20 mg day. At first it was working on to stop the tachycardia but with time the effect wear off and had to increase my dose and then it was lowering too much my blood pressure so my Cardiologist switch me on another beta blocker... I try several ones; bisoprolol; nadolol; timolol; pindolol; acebutolol... All of those fails to control the tachycardia. In those 2 years; I start having more and more heart related symptoms. Chest pain; jaw pain; left arm pain; exercise intolerance; dizziness; vertigo; intestine problems; low energy physically and mentally... I have severe anxiety (panic with agoraphobia; somatisation; GAD; social anxiety). My anxiety is not well control; I'm med sensitive and can't take antidepressants like Paxil; Lexapro or even older ones like imipramine... 1 mg of Paxil send me to the ER and same for Lexapro; didn't had problem with both drugs before and took them for my anxiety for years. I'm on a high dose of clonazepam 7 mg day; I'm addicted and do a very slow tapering withdrawal... Will take years to get off the clonazepam. I also deal with many panic attacks every day; can't get out th house; can't stay alone; everything trigger heart related symptoms like tachycardia or chest pain; a loud sound; music; too much people's around me... My nervous system seem to be overactive... I'm always sick; have chronic headache; heart is pounding in my chest all the time even when my heart rate is normal; droop of blood pressure or high blood pressure; feeling very hot all the time but can't sweat; can't exercise or just walk cause of my low energy and no physical endurance... I saw my Cardiogist 2 weeks ago; he look at my last holter monitor results and said it was anxiety and said that I may have dysautonomia but probably cause of the anxiety... I was stable on 10 mg x 3 of propranolol day for the last 7 months but the tachycardia was not under control at all... He suggest to RX 25 mg x 2 day of metoprolol. I start taking the metoprolol 2 weeks ago. I feel awful! Not only its not helping the tachycardia; but it make my anxiety worse. I have a migraine with throbbing pain in my head since I start it 2 weeks ago. I have more chest pain and left arm and hand are numb most of the time. My jaw hurt and all my teeth also. I have insomnia; have some vision change; my energy level is even lower than on the propranolol. I also feel depression... The propranolol don't do that... I feel so awful that I decrease the dose to 12.5 mg every 12 hours insistead of 25 mg every 12 hours but even with a lower dose I feel very bad. I'm the only one here who have problems with the metoprolol or brand name lopressor? It's the immediate release one; not the XL... I call my Cardio Doc and ask to be put again on the Propranolol but he don't return my phone call back. The only one beta blocker that I never try is the bystolic; it's new in the Canada but too expensive for me. I also hear that for anxiety it's bad? Well share you're experiences with the metoprolol vs propranolol... It can't be all in my head; I mean the side effects from the metoprolol are horrible...,2013,2013,37.0,Male,,,Hi Im deal tachycardia arrhytmia sinc 2 year My cardilogist first said dysautonomia pot blame also sever anxieti put beta blocker propranolol 20 mg day At first work stop tachycardia time effect wear increas dose lower much blood pressur cardiologist switch anoth beta blocker I tri sever one bisoprolol nadolol timolol pindolol acebutolol all fail control tachycardia In 2 year I start heart relat symptom chest pain jaw pain left arm pain exercis intoler dizzi vertigo intestin problem low energi physic mental I sever anxieti panic agoraphobia somatis gad social anxieti My anxieti well control Im med sensit cant take antidepress like paxil lexapro even older one like imipramin 1 mg paxil send ER lexapro didnt problem drug took anxieti year Im high dose clonazepam 7 mg day Im addict slow taper withdraw will take year get clonazepam I also deal mani panic attack everi day cant get th hous cant stay alon everyth trigger heart relat symptom like tachycardia chest pain loud sound music much peopl around My nervou system seem overact Im alway sick chronic headach heart pound chest time even heart rate normal droop blood pressur high blood pressur feel hot time cant sweat cant exercis walk caus low energi physic endur I saw cardiogist 2 week ago look last holter monitor result said anxieti said I may dysautonomia probabl caus anxieti I stabl 10 mg x 3 propranolol day last 7 month tachycardia control He suggest RX 25 mg x 2 day metoprolol I start take metoprolol 2 week ago I feel aw not help tachycardia make anxieti wors I migrain throb pain head sinc I start 2 week ago I chest pain left arm hand numb time My jaw hurt teeth also I insomnia vision chang energi level even lower propranolol I also feel depress the propranolol dont I feel aw I decreas dose 125 mg everi 12 hour insistead 25 mg everi 12 hour even lower dose I feel bad Im one problem metoprolol brand name lopressor it immedi releas one XL I call cardio doc ask put propranolol dont return phone call back the one beta blocker I never tri bystol new canada expens I also hear anxieti bad well share your experi metoprolol vs propranolol It cant head I mean side effect metoprolol horribl

I have hypotension; with SBP in the 60's (on Florinef o.1mg qMWF and Proamatine 2.5mg tid) at times in the am before I even get out of bed. I have POTs and am on Atenolol for HR control which does not help my low BP. I was recently in the hospital with the above problem and am still going to PT working on recovering my balance. The exact cause of the dizzyness etc has not been pinpointed. Speculation is a virus in my inner ear. But I think it is somehow related to my BP issues. I have been having problems for a year now; and the symptoms came on suddenly after a viral illness last year; unusual fatigue; lightheadedness; HR to 150 without much exertion and and increase in symptoms with high HR. I have been to the syncope clinic there and recently had a hemodynamic test. What I really want to know is if it is possible that the problems I am having now have anything to do with the syncope; couldn't possibly; or maybe are contributing to make the problem worse.

812,Atenolol+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night.

813,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending.

814,Atenolol+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think?

816,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 25 year-old female college student. I've had migraines since I was 13. I was (finally) diagnosed with intracranial hypertension at 21; Chiari Malformation at 22; and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome at 23. I've seen neurologists in New Jersey (my home state); Philadelphia; New York; and Maryland. I had a craniotomy/decompression; duraplasty; and laminectomy of C1 three months after my Chiari diagnosis at a well known hospital. It has been three years and I consider the surgery an utter failure. I am no different than I was before (with the added benefit of a psuedomeningocele!). My last cine flow (post surgery) shows I still have a blockage. I have tried more medications than I can count and they either do nothing or the side effects are so terrible that I can't stay on them long enough to find out it they'll work. I seem to be stuck in a cycle right now where I go see the neurologist; get a new med to try; have it fail; and have to deal with the migraines for another 6 months to a year until my next visit. Is this how things normally go once surgery has failed? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated - and please; if a med has worked for you; let me know! I go back to see my neurologist in a couple of weeks (only the third time; she just took over my case because my old neurologist was so busy I could barely ever see him) and I want to be prepared. -Kulili-,2011,2011,25.0,Female,,,Hi Im 25 yearold femal colleg student ive migrain sinc I 13 I final diagnos intracrani hypertens 21 chiari malform 22 ehlersdanlo syndrom 23 ive seen neurologist new jersey home state philadelphia new york maryland I craniotomydecompress duraplasti laminectomi C1 three month chiari diagnosi well known hospit It three year I consid surgeri utter failur I differ I ad benefit psuedomeningocel My last cine flow post surgeri show I still blockag I tri medic I count either noth side effect terribl I cant stay long enough find theyll work I seem stuck cycl right I go see neurologist get new med tri fail deal migrain anoth 6 month year next visit Is thing normal go surgeri fail ani feedback would greatli appreci pleas med work let know I go back see neurologist coupl week third time took case old neurologist busi I could bare ever see I want prepar kulili
817,Atenolol+hypertension,I have a confession..... I relapsed; but on a small scale. As some of you may know; I am addicted to Percocets and quit over the long holiday of Christmas and New Years. I started work at a VERY demanding job (in politics) that has me working non-stop 14-16 hours per day right after I quit. I couldn't do it. I could not cope. I was having panic attacks and was not able to do my job. I went back on the pills. However; it's not as bad as it sounds. I'm taking 1 pill to 1 1/2 pills per day so I can do my job. I simply tried to quit at the wrong time. I also sought out a doctor to help me. He has diagnosed me with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and he put me on Lexapro which combats both diseases. He thinks I have been self medicating with the Percocets and is helping me taper off the Percs while the Lexapro does it's job. The Lexapro has already started working and I am feeling MUCH better and am able to cope on a small dose of Percocets. The first week was terrible; but now my body is adjusting to the lower amount and the Lexapro is kicking; I'm going to taper even more next week. He wants me to stop taking the Percocets all together in six weeks. It's nice to have the support of my doctor. He's also put me on Atenolol for hypertension because I could not STAND the constant pounding of my heart. He put me on low dosages of Xanax to take when I feel a panic attack coming on. I'm happy to report that the pounding heart has TOTALLY stopped thanks to the Atenolol and I am taking less and less of the Xanax every day. The Lexapro is really working. Today was the best day yet! I'm going to try to go without any Percocets at all this weekend and see how I do. I'm getting more familiar with my new job and I believe I am going to be able to quit the Percocets for good on the current plan I am on. I have a vacation coming up on March 6th for nine days.

818,Atenolol+hypertension,Normal body weight 115 (30 yr F) but gained 12 pounds in 3 days after start of propranolol. Continued to gain an additional 13 in the next 2 weeks. Began methimazole one-and-a-half weeks after propranolol. I normally eat 1900 calories per day w/moderate activity. Could I have gained 25 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks on that sort of caloric intake? Or is it the medication? DR said I had some fluid retention but made no further comment about the weight gain. Is there something else I can take for hypertension/SVT/sinus tachycardia? Elevated liver enzymes present after 3 wks methimazole usage. TSH and T3 were in normal range as of 2 mo. ago with total T4 still slightly elevated. Wanted to reduce methimazole but DR said no. Why did he say no? Now 2 mo. later and my hair is falling out (800 strands per day in the past 6 wks. and it hasn't slowed down at all); low waking body temp of 95.9F with shivering in the AM; hypnic jerks before bed or when sitting for extended periods at desk; occasional fever-like symptoms (flushed/heated body; sweating; coughing; sore throat) but it's difficult to tell if I even have a fever with the low body temp; and persistent sore throat. Why didn't DR reduce methimazole when my labs were so close to normal? I feel this all could have been avoided if he had just agreed to reduce medication. What do I do now? I need guidance; please!

820,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 52 y.o. w/f who has been taking atenolol 50 mgs. and 40 mgs.lasix. Recently I was under a good deal of stress and was informed that my pressure was running 180/105 and went up from there! Each time my Cardiologist took it it rose until I told him to stop. I tried to explain the stress I have been under and the fact that ""I beleive"" I am suffering from ""white coat"" syndrome because I monitor my pressure at home routinely and it is WELL controled! He on the other hand stated that if the BP was up in his offoce he must beleive that it is also up at other times. This being said; he placed me on a starting dose of Avapro; 150 mgs. Several days later I started to have major bouts of depression; very tired; heaviness on my entire left side and also left hand and foot became very cold.I also had frequent palpitations. My head felt like my pressure was elevated but just the oppisite was happening; avg. BP was 116/68. My Internist told me to decrease the medication to 75mgs. and if in a few days I was feeling better then we must assume that these ""feelings"" were coming from the Avapro. She also stated that she has had other people demonstrate these same ""symptoms"" however because angiotension II is a new class of medicines there is still very little data available. After 2 days of 75 mgs. I do feel a little better. I am also decreasing the drug again ; in order to discontinue it entirely. Now I guess my question is; ""is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME"" ? If not; what is one to do when taking additional medication that seem to only agravate the body as a whole? I also recently went through a complete physicial and Cardiolyte Stress test; lipid profile etc; everything was great! Thanks for your help with this matter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear D.L.; Q: Is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME ?. A: ""White coat hypertension"" has been described as high blood pressure that is only elevated in the doctor' office due to the stress of seeing the doctor. Yes; it does exist but no it does not mean that one does not need medication. The reason for this is that no one (at least no one I know) lives in a totally stress free environment. Therefore whenever one is stressed their blood pressure will be high. It is during those high periods that the damage of hypertension is done. Thus it may be beneficial to see what a ""stress"" blood pressure is and to treat based on that number.

821,Atenolol+hypertension,I finally got a chance to post a question here. I posted this a few days ago as a response to someone else's question; but I'd like to get an opinion from an MD on the board as well. The full story is in this URL: http://www.medhelp.org/forums/cardio/messages/35673.html; under the name feelsick2. I'd appreciate if you could read the full story instead of this post. The summaryis as follows: I'm 28; 178 pounds; normal resting blood pressure 115/75; pulse 72. No major health problems before. No heart problems in parents (both alive; 55 yrs old) or grandparents (all passed away around 82 yrs old) One day; woke up with a sore throat and mild fever (99.8); took a TheraFlu (aspirin). Then 2 hours later; started feeling weird; dizzy; started feeling a bit of pulsations in my chest and head. Things started to get worse in 10 mins; and suddenly; my heart was racing; my hands and feet were tingling and numb and I was sweating and flushing. (no chest pain; shortness of breath). Went back home to rest. Major complaint the next couple days were a strong feeling of pulsations INSIDE my head; often in my neck; face; ears and jaw. No pain or headache. Couldn't go to work because these feelings were making me dizzy; After 2 days of rest; one night these pulsations started getting worse again; so that morning I went to my PCP. Since then (it has been 3 months now); I have these pulsations in my head. I have had 2 MRI/MRAs; 2 Chest-x-rays; Cardio consult; Neuro consult; ENT consult; all non-conclusive.

822,Atenolol+hypertension,First of all; thank you for all your responses; they've been very helpful. The event monitor showed only PVC's. The stress echo test looked great except for one thing: The tricuspid valve is leaky. The doctor didn't think it looked too serious. He wants to look at it again in a year. Could this be connected to the PVC's or the painful PVC's? Does it cause anxiety like mitral valve prolaps seems to? Or; could my anxiety have caused the tricuspid problem? What is a typical prognoses for someone with this? I also get pressure in my face and sometimes dizziness: Could this be related to the tricuspid? As mentioned in the original post; I have had breathing trouble for the past four years. Could my breathing difficulty be pulmonary hypertension resulting from the tricuspid anomaly? When breathing is tough; I'll get the erg for a deep breath; I'll try to take it; but I wont get that satisfied feeling. There's no fluid in the lungs; no wheezing and no asthma. In fact; doctors have not been able to give a diagnoses. My breathing gets better with regular exercise; and; when it's been bad enough for the ER my oxygen saturation has always been normal. Except for what I've mentioned here; I don't seem to have other symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid regurgitation. Or; does my breathing difficulty sound anxiety related?

823,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 27 year old man from Indiana. For the past three years I have been to two family doctors; two neurologists and three cardiologists because I have fainting spells on average every 4-6 days. From November 1998 when they started to January of 2001; they have maintained this ""schedule""; however; on January 15th; 2001; I had a fainting spell and when I ""woke up;"" I had lost feeling and function of both of my legs. This has continued with every blackout I have had since. I do have warning signs before the blackouts occur. I get dizzy; lightheaded; and have blurred vision. The last sign I have before I faint is tingling or numbness in my hands and feet. These warning signs happen every time before I have a blackout. The blackouts; according to those people around me when I have them; last 10-15 minutes. Periodically; my feet will turn blue for no reason and this does not happen during a blackout or just before one either. The diagnosis for my problem is neurocardiogenic syncope; although the cardioloigsts are not confident in this because I do not recover quickly after a blackout. It takes up to 48 hours sometimes to recover from a blackout. The current cardiologist I have started me on beta blockers (Atenolol first and then Betaxolol); which have caused a complete loss of energy. The cardiologist took me off of those and put me on Florinef; so that my blood vessels would remain dialated. This medication has caused my blackouts to occur more frequently. The next stage the cardiologist has suggested involves a drug that causes hypertension and can do damage to my heart; which he is retisent to put me on because of my young age and because I suffer from hypotension. For your information; I have had the following tests; all which have come back negative: EKG; EEG; MRI on my brain and my thoracic spinal cord; Doppler Arterial Flow on my legs and arms; blood tests for my thyroid and diabetes; treadmill test; and electrocardio catheters checking my heart and valve function. I did have two tilt table tests; both of which came back positive for neurocardiogenic syncope; which is the only test I had that has come back positive. During the EEG; my first cardiologist found I had an arrhythmia. I would appreciate any suggestion you may have on what is wrong with me. If my current cardiologist does not put me on the drug that causes hypertension; then he has suggested sending me to the Mayo Clinic or to Cleveland Clinic; which is why I am posting this question. Thank you for reading this question and I would appreciate any information you could offer to shed light on this problem I am having.

825,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy several months ago; that is thought to be caused by taking a new biologic injection for Psoriatic Arthritis. I have chest pains daily; along with shortness of breath on exertion. My angiogram showed all the heart arteries to be clear; so why am i still having chest pains? Also; all my cardiologist has treated me with is Altace 10mg once a day. Is my cariologist being aggressive enough? He seems to think my chest pains are not of concern since my angiogram showed clear arteries. I've been off the biologic medicine since late September and have not seen any improvement in my chest pains and shortness of breath. Do you think my heart will return to normal size and function?

826,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain.

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment?

827,Atenolol+hypertension,My husband is being treated for hbp since June/98. He has been on both ace inhibitors and beta blockers from low to high doses. At this point his pressure has remained unchanged. It averages between 150/95 - 170-112. He is on the highest dose of atenolol(?). He has been on 100mg. for approx. 1 week now with no change. I have several concerns at this point. His weight; diet is good. He moderately exercises; stress level is high. 1. He may have had undetected hbp for any length of time previous to June. 2. Since June there has been no change which is prolonging the condition with possible effects? 3. What normally causes resistance to the medication and what could be causing it and could there be permanent organ damage?

Will taking medication for stress help because no matter how hard he trys not to let things upset him they still do. Also; we have always had suspicions that he is ADHD could this be a factor. My husband has always been a strong hard working man; but; I've notice in the past year to year and a half he's not been himself he complains often about not feeling well and doesn't feel like doing as much as before all this.

829,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 34 year old female; in relativley good health. I had an episode of tachycardia 5 years ago. My heart rate went up to 140bpm for no reason. It stayed there for 2 hours before I called paramedics. They hooked me up to moniter and said everything was fine; probably PAC? Since then I have had nothing of that nature; it was like a panic attack heart episode that lasted way too long. Heavy and pounding. Three times I have had episodes of bradychardia in the past 5 years; where my heart rate has dropped to 47-57 and I have felt extreme fatigue and once shortness of breath. I also have experienced many times; rapid heart rate after laying down to go to sleep. 90-110bpm. This was not as pounding as the tachycardia; While working as a waitress; sometimes by the end of the shift; I would get rapid heart rate of up to 112-115; and could not make it go away until I had slept all night.Also at times I will feel my heart flutter; like a series of skipped beats; this too is during times of stress; usually when I try to rest. Various doctors that I have seen have told me it is nothing to worry about. I have not seen a cardiologist. I was just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist; who suggested that i get in to see a cardiologist right away.

830,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My hunsband had mild chest discomfort in sept 2009 and we did echo cardiogram ; it came to be normal with mild left ventricular hipertrophy and the doctor said it will reverse by itself if BP is well controlled. He has hypertension and diabetes. We did an echo april 2010 and no more left ventricular hypertrophy.. But looking at his report; the measurement of IVSD and PWD have decreased to 0.9 from 1.2. But the over all chamber size of LV and LA has increased from 2009 to 2010 as below. in sept 2009 LV diast 4.0 LV syst 2.2 LA 2.3 in april 2010 LV diast 4.1 LV sys 3.5 LA 3.7 Im afraid about the increase rate in one year. He has family history of cardiomyopathy(Not his parents or siblings but cousins); though he does not have it. his EF remains same at 60% from 2009 and 2010. Is he at the risk of developing any kind of cardiomyopathy? Will the LV and LA size get back to normal? what ways can we control it? He changed the BP medicine in between these 2 echos from Enalapril to Cardace.But changed back to Enalapril now.,2010,2010,,Female,,,Hi My hunsband mild chest discomfort sept 2009 echo cardiogram came normal mild left ventricular hipertrophi doctor said revers BP well control He hypertens diabet We echo april 2010 left ventricular hypertrophi but look report measur ivsd pwd decreas 09 12 but chamber size LV LA increas 2009 2010 sept 2009 LV diast 40 LV syst 22 LA 23 april 2010 LV diast 41 LV sy 35 LA 37 Im afraid increas rate one year He famili histori cardiomyopathynot parent sibl cousin though EF remain 60 2009 2010 Is risk develop kind cardiomyopathi will LV LA size get back normal way control He chang BP medicin 2 echo enalapril cardacebut chang back enalapril

Holter (24 hour) monitor; Event Monitor (30 day); Echo; MRI; Stress; Tilt Table; Angiogram; EP study; blood work; etc. I've spoken with two Cardiologists and have been told that my heart is structurally normal and that the PVC's are benign.

833,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have been taking Inderal for 2-3 years. I have recently become pregnant. (1-2months) I take 10mg total a day. A half a pill in the morning; and a half a pill at night. This seemed to help all my symptoms with MVPS. I spoke to my cardiologist and he said he thinks I should not take it anymore. He told me I should wean myself off of it. I took 4 half pill a day for four days; then one-half a pill every other day for four days. I didn't take one yesterday at all and today I took my last half a pill. Should I get some symptoms? Will my heart rate speed up? And how long will it take to get out of my system? Will I have a heart attack? I am quite worried. The cardiologist is the one who told me how to wean. Also; the nurse at the gynecologist office said I could continue to take it. I would think the cardiologist would know better. Could you please give me your opinion?

We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was ""a little off"" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested?

835,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female with a history of PVC's. They were very bad about 23 years ago---especially during pregnancy. I haven't had any bad episodes for approximately 8 years. A few months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and I am now on Inderal---20mg. three times a day. This seems to control my blood pressure. After I had been on the Inderal for about a month I began to have the PVC's again. It seems like these episodes are as bad; if not worse; than during pregnancy. I figured that these were triggered by the Inderal; but my doctor didn't think so. She did order a holter monitor and she called a few days later to tell me that I needed to see a cardiologist. She did not go into detail about the results---she just said that she saw enough to know that I needed to see someone else. It seems likely to me; that somehow the Inderal is aggravating the arrhythmia. I have learned from this website that my PVC's are likely to be vagally mediated. They are worse when I rest from activity and when I lay down at night. Based on what I have told you--Is there a possiblity that Inderal could be somehow causing or aggravating this problem and what would be a good alternative? Are there other BP meds that I should also avoid under these circumstances?

836,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 43 year old male; never smoked and about 25lbs overweight in spite of exercise. Since mid-December; I've had PACs and have been subsequently diagnosed with ectopic atrial tachycardia. The problems started when I had a cold and took allegra-d. I had a lot of premature beats which disappeared within 24 hours. The problem has been reoccurring in spite of my elimination of caffeine and other stimulants. I also had a couple episodes of tachycardia that would last for a few seconds; stop; start again and thus resulting in a pretty chaotic heartbeat. I had a nuclear stress test; echo; event monitor and all tests are normal. Also thyroid function; potassium levels; etc are normal. I'm currently taking cardizem LA 120mg and atenolol xl 50mg. I continue to have skipped beats but no real events of tachycardia. I met with an EP and he said that I should consider a PVI but scared me quite a bit by talking a lot about the amount of risk of a PVI vs. other types of ablation. He also implied that my condition will most likely progress into afib. So 2 questions: 1) Am I more or less likely to experience afib given the above facts? 2) Can you provide some info on the risks of PVI vs. anti-arrythmic drugs (assuming my condition worsens and I have to make a choice)?

838,Atenolol+hypertension,"About 5 months ago I was diagnosed with Depression NOS and Anxiety at Mayo Clinic. Evaluations by two psychiatrists and a therapist have revealed no ""emotional"" cause - Mayo Clinic's best ""guess"" was a viral infection causing a biological inbalance. I am currently going to therapy to deal better with stress and anxiety. For the chemical inbalance; I have been taking Paxil along with Trazadone for sleep. The problem is that the Paxil works great for a few weeks then seems to ""poop out"". I am steadily improving but keep having dips back that are starting to scare me. My Dr. first added desipramine to boost the Paxil (it helped at first; then made me extremely tired and stopped working in 4-5 weeks. He then tried Welbutrin but it made me way too nervous so it was stopped in a few days. Then a few weeks ago he increase my dosage of Paxil to 30 mg. For about two weeks I felt great - back to my old self. Then about five days ago I started feeling really sleepy and groggy and all my energy was zapped. I tried to relax and thought it would go away - but it hasn't. Its hard to work and get back to normal life with this sleepiness. I think the 30 mg of Paxil may be too much. (I take 1/2 at 7am and 1/2 at 7pm and sleep great). Now I am getting nervous that I am never going to be back to normal. Do you think I have given Paxil enough time to work? I am considering asking my Dr. to let me try Celexa as I have heard good things about it. What would be involved with switching meds?

Healthy other than being overweight...and these darn palpitations. Ive had them for so long. They come and go. Ive been thru all the testing...several times. I went quite a while with no palpitations....months and months. Now; they are back. Going thru a stressful time right now in our family with my mother; and a serious illness.... but...right now things have settled down for a bit... My question today is...Ive noticed a sharp increase in my pvs; pacs; in the past few days. The weekend was a stressful one; with not alot of sleep...so I guess I can figure out what brought them on... but boy are they bad today!! I bet I have 20 a minute or so...not every minute... What seems odd about them is that if I get up and walk across the room; or at work; walk across the building; wow; that really brings them on-I can feel it as Im walking. Like always; I have no other symptoms...but just feel the jumping ;and of course; I reach for my pulse....I am an expert pulse-taker; Im sad to say.

I have a FEW...but when I got out of the car yesterday; and when I walked anywhere today...the palps are just firing up.

I wonder...How long is an echo; ekg; stress test & holter ""good"" for? I ask; because I had the whollllllle workup in April 08. So; just over a year. It was expensive--- and they made me feel like a hypochondriac...when they were putting the holter on me; the technolgist says...you are having this put on...for palpitations?? Like...that was ridiculous.... I am not in good physical shape---so my stress test was short--but the cardiologist said it was fine--normal--nothing alarming. So..that is my question... anytime I get these back...my first instinct...is to run to the Dr. But really...I dont know that should. Theyve told me they are benign....and to ""not worry"" about them.

Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further.

843,Atenolol+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7. Also World Journal of Gastroenterology 2005;11(48):7560-7563 has an article on losartan and fibrosis and there are other articles on the Internet.,2009,2009,,Male,,,I liver transplant 2000 get cirrhosi follow hepat abvd chemotherapi fail interferon alpha therapi unfortun hcv elimin I ran across articl indic losartancozaar blood pressur medicin may reduc elimin fibrosi I ask doctor chang blood pressur medicin coincid visit detect fibrosi feel stiff liver the hepat stellat cell hsc activ myofibroblastlik cell produc fibrosi angiotensin II losartan act block angiotensin II receptor cost 6000 per month medicar vasotec cost 500 per month I wonder enalaprilvasotec angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitor would fibrosi reduc effect losartan sinc stop angiotensin II form first place work well block receptor angiotensin II dock cheaper cost I found posit answer chines medic journal 2001 vol 114 No 6 page 5837 also world journal gastroenterolog 2005114875607563 articl losartan fibrosi articl internet

Anyhoo; as of this morning I have been hacking up a storm; as of 2 hours from waking up I developed a sore throat (I believe from the hard coughing) I have not coughed anything up but the coughing gets so hard it becomes dry-reacing frequently. And that taste of blood waay down in the back of my throat is ever present after each cough. As I have depression and mood disorder; I don't want to go straight to the doc as quite often individuals with mental health issues don't get taken seriously here in Australia; quite often I would get told ""Go to your psychaitrist"" as if I am crazy. and in the past I ended up in trouble with serious health issues that went undiagnosed simply because some peanut G.P. thought it was all in my head; until I ended up in hospital sometimes in quite serious condition.

851,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm 53; male; not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol; until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago). I found the combo effective; regular monitoring showed BP controlled; no side effects. about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy; standing up; and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However; dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril; then stopped another quarter; then completely. Monitored my own BP; went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed. However; my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise; and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion; dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff; which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative; although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work. I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'. I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months; and is it a coincidence that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia; and has done a MRI of my head (still await results). I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling; almost numbness; (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse. I don't think I'm going to keel over; but I just cant understand the chain of events. My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down. Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's; yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose. I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks 'your fine'; but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed. Can high blood pressure resolve like this ? Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ? The neurologist has recommended duloxotine; which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :( Thanks for reading,2014,2014,52.0,Male,,,Hi Im 53 male overweight I diagnos hbp I 28 origin treat atenelol chang doctor switch 30mg coracten 20mg lisinopril 13 year ago I found combo effect regular monitor show BP control side effect 16 month ago I notic I get dizzi stand dizzi exercis I stop coracten doc confirm BP ok without coracten howev dizzi continu I stop half lisinopril stop anoth quarter complet monitor BP went doc confirm ok typic read sit 11776 needless say I delight amaz howev troubl seem start I continu slightli lighthead exercis feel pin needl scalp upper face start I thought may neck I travel lot episod confus dizzi vertigo hotel larg meal I urg eat sweet stuff reliev symptom time sinc test reactiv hypoglycemia neg although I think blood sugar involv coup occas due ongo feel worsen prickl face eye I spent month work I put 24hr BP cuff came back averag normal I dont realli understand high BP 25 year dissapear within matter month coincid new symptom almost coincid last dose lisinopril I neurologist mention dysesthsia done mri head still await result I feel feel wors prickl almost numb like dentist anesthet wear scalp face wors I dont think Im go keel I cant understand chain event My note would HR eat goe bit wild I urg liesit stand without eat systol low 100 yet diastol seem stabl 80 normal limit I suppos I feel weird I exercis regularli My doc think fine I dont feel I neither anxiou depress can high blood pressur resolv like could BP medic caus kind perman withdraw caus symptom the neurologist recommend duloxotin I hope avoid I dont seem get anywher thank read

I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart?

854,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By CCF Cardio MD-SGM on March 21; 1998 at 13:17:41: In Reply to: palpitations posted by jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: : This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this ""defect"" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were ""shuddering""); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a ""click""? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid ""leaking"" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in ""slower motion"". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest ""rushes"" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these ""weird"" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol. Thank you for your time. _ Dear Jeanette; From your question; I gather that your most significant complaint is palpitations. I will attempt to address this issue and provide some recommendations and reassurance. Palpitations; as you know; often represent premature or ""extra"" heart beats that arise from the ventricles (PVC's) or the atria (PAC's). In the presence of a structurally normal heart (i.e. no history of ventricular dysfunction or significant coronary artery disease) these irregular beats are benign. I want to reiterate this; because I think it's a crucial point: If a heart is normal; palpitations pose no risk to the patient. I hope that this is reassuring. Many factors such as increased thyroid hormone levels (possibly exacerbated by therapy you were receiving) caffeine; alcohol; cigarettes and other stimulants can increase the incidence of PVC's and PAC's. Often; treatment with beta-blocking medications such as atenolol or possibly calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can reduce the frequency and symptoms of palpitations. Hyperthyroidism can exacerbate or cause palpitations and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias); however its effects are not permanent; and tend to resolve when thyroid hormone levels return to normal. In regards to esophageal reflux; sometimes this can produce palpitations by irritating the atrial chambers of the heart; which lie adjacent to the esophagus. Therapy for reflux includes antacids; H-2 blocking and other drugs like Pepcid or Tagamet; weight loss; and possibly surgical therapy for resistant cases. Sleep apnea can sometimes cause heart rhythm abnormalities; and can produce other complications such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). If you have a history of loud snoring or have been witnessed to stop breathing for intermittent periods during sleep; you may wish to be evaluated for this condition with a sleep study. It appears that you've undergone extensive testing of the heart. I don't believe that repetition of these tests would yield any additional information. One consideration is performing recordings of your palpitations with an event recorder which you could turn on when you're experiencing the problem. This would identify whether you have PVC's or alternatively suffer from an arrhythmia. In either case; an electrophysiologic study of the heart may be helpful. This procedure can sometimes be used to cure arrhythmias; and in some cases can also remove the source of PVC's. Something to consider. Hope I've been of help.

855,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 37 y/o female not overweight; I don't smoke. Not diabetic. My cholesterol and blood sugar were just checked and are good. I have hypothyroidism; but I am on medication and that was recently checked and is within normal limits. I do have asthma and am taking medication for that. Over the past two months I have had the following symptoms. I wake up in the night not quite feeling well. I usually feel a bit weak in my arms and nauseated. Usually I have heart palpitations and chest pain. Then my heart will start pounding and I will usually get up to head for the bathroom because I think I am going to vomit. I feel very weak and am shaking. I then notice my heart is racing. When I take my pulse; it is usually between 160-180. I don't really notice feeling anxious; I am usually half asleep and after the episode passes; I just want to go back to bed. My pulse usually comes back down within 5 minutes. Then I start to get the chills. By the time I am thinking I should call 911; the episode passes I feel dumb about calling 911. I also notice my skin looks funny; kind of a reddish color on my face and arms and my hands and feet are a strange grey color? I have had these symptoms approx. 8 times over the past 2 months and always at night. I do take medication for anxiety. The only symptoms I notice during the day is that I sometimes have shortness of breath and palpitations and sometimes my blood pressure is high. But I figured it was because of my asthma.,2009,2009,,Female,,,Hi I 37 yo femal overweight I dont smoke not diabet My cholesterol blood sugar check good I hypothyroid I medic recent check within normal limit I asthma take medic over past two month I follow symptom I wake night quit feel well I usual feel bit weak arm nauseat usual I heart palpit chest pain then heart start pound I usual get head bathroom I think I go vomit I feel weak shake I notic heart race when I take puls usual 160180 I dont realli notic feel anxiou I usual half asleep episod pass I want go back bed My puls usual come back within 5 minut then I start get chill By time I think I call 911 episod pass I feel dumb call 911 I also notic skin look funni kind reddish color face arm hand feet strang grey color I symptom approx 8 time past 2 month alway night I take medic anxieti the symptom I notic day I sometim short breath palpit sometim blood pressur high but I figur asthma
856,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 36; non smoker non drinker; no history of heart disease in family; non excersizing and 40 pounds over weight; female. 11 months ago I developed a terrible chest cold and coughed for months. When I went to the Dr. they found I have high blood pressure ( again... I did in my late 20s but it went away with two children) of 160 over 90. I was put on atenolol. shortly after that; i started having alarming arm and chest discomfort. It was random; both at reat and during excersize. Flash forward to recently; I had an echo that found an slightly enlarged left ventricle. I have terrible heart palps even on the Bystolic; and now; today; I spiked a high BP reading 160 over 100 only 2 minutes into the treadmill; so he ended the test. I was sent home; to wait three weeks for a nuclear stress test. My question is this; why am I home with arm and chest pains? If I am having arm; neck chest and sometimes even jaw discomfort; plus palps; spiking BP; enlarged Lft. ventricle; leaky valve; and dizzy spells; why wasn't I admitted? Why send me home with a blood pressure cuff and tell me to make an appt for a nuclear test in three weeks? He told me the chance of me having ablockage is low; but Im thinking; im fat; im 36... I think theres a pretty good chance right? So I am sitting home; arm hurting every time I exhert myself or try to get a good night sleep hoping I dont have a sudden heart attack... should I go to a new cardiologist?

857,Atenolol+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky. Being so close to start with means anytime I don't drink enough; get a fever; have diarrhea; sweat too much in the summer heat... then I totally bottom out my bp.

Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?).

859,Atenolol+hypertension,Three weeks ago I had ablation for AV node reentry; and two other sites as well for atrial tachy and extrabeats. Ep said he got it all. Two weeks ago was put on a Loop monitor and my EP said he seen one atrial tachy 16 beats total and a number of sinus tachy; one up to 120bpm and a number of pac's. Well;last nite around 3am I was awakened from a sound sleep with the worst attach ever;even before ablation. I recorded and sent it in. It was beating at 160bpm+ at times with a few missed beats and was unrelenting. They said it looked like Sinus Tachy. The center told me to call my hospital which I did. The doc asked what I had on hand to take. I had an 80mg fast act Verapamil and 240sr Verapamil. I took the 80 and it slowed the heart rate down to the high 80's. Then took the 240mg. My HB is around 75 this am but it took 1 1/2 hours to get there. This no longer sounds like a normal variant of ablation does it? Also; I am to go on 50 mg Toprol 1xday after speaking with EP's office this am. and was told I could take the fast acting verapamil if it got untolerable as well as the Toprol. Can I mix Toprol with Verapamil? I took pinadole (spelling)one time prior to alation and it made my heart beat fast so was told to quit. Will the Toprol work better? What Could this sinus tachy be from. I don't have any other problems that I know of. Could this be a onetime thing due to post ablation? Can a persons heart beat that fast and long with no bad effects? Also; my bp is naturally low 112/58 usually. Can I still tolerate Toprol?

860,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; Thank you for taking my questions and for providing this very valuable service. I am a woman who turned 49 years old yesterday. I have a ten year history of panic and GAD that waxes and wanes. Cardiac symptoms; such as tachycardia and ""skipped"" beats occur when it's high. I have had two echocardiograms; the first showed MVP(mild; but medicate for dental work); the second didn't. These were both performed several years ago. I had a normal holter monitor test last April. I did have some symptoms; but was told holter was ""normal."" I did not ask any specifics. I have been having increasing bouts of tachycardia and palpitations again. I am also struggling again with my anxiety and I'm in the middle of an awful perimenopause. I am sometimes anemic and have had problems in the past with low potassium. Lab values for each of these was normal last month when I had them retested. My questions for you are: 1. How much do changing hormones and anxiety-produced adrenaline factor in to periodic tachycardia and palpitations? 2. Is there any way I can tell if anxiety is precipitating the palps or if the palps are precipitating the anxiety? 3. Would more testing be in order and if so; which tests would be helpful? 4. Is it better to medicate for the anxiety or the cardiac symptoms? (I have had success in the past with klonopin and had no problems coming off. I have had terrible side effects with SSRI's and also with beta blockers. I am willing to give the beta blockers another chance if that is the best route to go.)

861,Atenolol+hypertension,What could be the causes of near bradycardia. Pulse rate is always around 58-62 when at rest ( watching TV at the computor etc). Even standing or slow walking seem to take the pulse to only around 70-75. The reason I ask is that I started to notice palpitations around the same time as the lowered heart rate. I have always had palpitations (PAC's and PVC's) but not in the large volume as now (almost 1000 a day;mostly PACs with few PVCs). For many years before I would only have them occassionaly when tired; stressed etc; now they are at a steady rate. I did start an extensive exercise/diet program ( no fads or drugs; just watching what I eat with lots of cardio) 4 months ago and lost over 30 lbs and was feeling better and stronger than I had in many years. Went to have it checked out and all tests came back within normal limits except for mild hypertension for which atenolol was prescribed in low dose. It seemed that this drug lowered my pulse rate even lower to around 50 and I felt like a slug. I'm 53; otherwise in good health; have stopped almost all exercise for fear that we are missing something of a larger scale but the slow heart rate continues as do the palpitations. Can you shed some light on what could have/is causing all this. I've heard all kinds of answers- stretched the heart because of weight lifting; noise reaching the hearts pacemaker;heart not as flexible due to age; adrenalin excess; etc. It came and stayed out of the blue; granted I now feel and think about it all the time and the anxiety might be a factor but can't be the catch all.

862,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for this forum. It has been very informative. I will apologize in advance for the length of this; but I know how hard it is to get on and wanted to make sure you knew my whole story. I am a 38 year old female; overweight by about 30 pounds. In October; 1999; had a situation where I was awakened by my heart racing. It scared me; but I attributed it to too much caffeine that night and finally it subsided. (This was also a time when I began taking birth control after having been off of it for about 1 1/2 years). I had been told prior to that when I tried to give blood that my heart rate was too fast. GP said it was within normal range; 60-100 but suggested I lose weight. I also went off birth control at the end of December. On January 12; 2000; I went to the ER as I was working and felt my heart all of a sudden begin racing. They determined when I first went in that it was at 192bpm. It came down on it's own to 108 in about five minutes; however they still administered a calcium channel blocker to get it down further before releasing me. The Verapamil (120 or 160 mg?) didn't agree with me and my GP took me off of them. I had an EKG and Echo during that time which showed nothing. They were checking for MVP. On March 10; 2000 began racing again at about 140bpm. Went to GP and it went down to 70 bpm in about 20 minutes. He went ahead and sent me to cardiologist for consult; he said that it looked like PSVT; nothing life threatening. Put me on event monitor and gave me Lopressor 50 mg. to take it I had an event and it didn't convert withing 30 minutes or so. He said that I could go to electrophysiologist to look at options; medicine or ablation. I had an event which I was able to record about two weeks ago; event monitor showed 170bpm. I took Lopressor which convered it to 70's range in about 20 minutes. EKG which was taken at hospital during this event showed the following: Vent. rate: 142bpm; PR interval 152ms; QRS duration 88ms; QT/QTc 264/406ms; P-R-T axes 265 97 -45. My questions are (any that you can answer): What is going on with me? Is it dangerous? I would like to not be on medicine if possible. In my situation; is catheter ablation a consideration?

864,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Raymond on March 17; 1999 at 22:20:28: In Reply to: Re: Tremors and other odd occurences posted by CCF neuro MD MM on March 10; 1999 at 09:40:32: I hope this post does not appear to long winded. However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of ""attack"" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor. I feel there is some underlying cause; but they both have said that my episode has nothing to do with the tremor. but why did it become evident only after my other problems. I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor. A less selective drug like Propanolol-(Inderal)would have a chance of helping both problems simultaneously. Hi I visited my Neurologist today 3/16/99 and during our conversation I brought up Propanolol as an alternative to the antenolol. He feeling was that one was as effective as the other in treating E.T.; He also left it up to me to decide if I wanted to switch Beta blockers. As such I have a three fold question for you; 1)What if any is the significant difference between Atenolol and Propanolol in treating E.T.; 2) Are there any definitive tests (ways) to diagnose E.T. (or is it left up to the doctors experience only); and 3) Are there any other illnesses that could possibly present themselves as E.T. Whe I first had my episode the internist tested for pheochromocytoma; but when all test came back negative he decided it was E.T. Thanks for your time and energy.

865,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run.

867,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 26 year old male; and have had 2 EKG's in the past 3 months. One said I had Sinus Tachycardia; and the other one said Supraventricular. I have to pass a Holter but the waiting list is long ( will get it Oct.14 2008 ) but meanwhile my doctor told me to take Metoprolol because my tachycradia is almost 24/7 (with some exceptions; like at night most often) but runs around 120-170 bpm about all day. This caused me lately to be very exhausted and constantly fatigued; and having trouble excercising. It also generated ALOT of anxiety in me. So; today I took my first dose; I'm prescribed 2 pills a day of 25 mg. I started with halves though because I was scared my heart would drop TOO low; or my blood pressure too low; because I'm not taking this for hypertension. What concerns me; alot I must say; is some things I read about it. Like I do feel light-headed; dizziness and such; but I'm aware that they may be short-term side-effects (or are they?). What startled me tonight was I felt colder (like chills); and my hands felt slightly cold. I read on wikipedia that ""It may also reduce blood flow to the hands and feet; causing them to feel numb and cold""... but can this be dangerous? I mean; isn't blood flow important; and also; can it just be temporary? Another thing that alarmed me was here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker#Side_Effects_.2F_Health_Consequences Under Health Consequences; it includes stuff like ""Impaired Circulation"" and ""Heart Failure""; and it does not say ""Possible Health Consequences""... so are these things gonna happen without a doubt or are they just mere possibilities? And while I'm at it; are there alot of people who take Metoprolol and have no permanent problems but only beneficial results from this medication? Sorry if I'm bombarding with questions; I just found some sources kind of scary; and also my symptoms which I feared might be long-term so that's why I was wondering if they could wither away.

869,Atenolol+hypertension,I am having some bizarre symptoms for about 5 weeks now. My dentist found elevated bp at a routine appointment; which I thought was strange; since I had a complete cardiological workup in January (echocardiogram; holter monitor; 24 hr monitor; ekg; stress/echo test; blood work; carotid doppler) and a ct scan and u/s of the abdomen and pelvis. The only thing showing up on the ct was diverticulosis which i've had for years. I have also had gallstones since 1995 when I was pregnant; and they really never bothered me. Over the past 5 weeks; my bp stayed elevated and was getting worse. I have been petrified of taking bp meds because of side effects. I have multiple drug allergies and an allergy to dyes (I had a tumor in my submandibular gland in 1990 (where I had an anaphylaxis reaction to the cat scan dye) & a melanoma in my fingernail in 1992). I have had anaphylaxis reactions to pencillin and sulfa drugs and some other really bad reactions to other drugs. I didn't do well under general anesthesia when I had my tumor taken out in 1990; so I am petrified of being put out or even having a cocktail of drugs (i.e. propophol & versed for a colonoscopy so I won't have one; if I need to do it; I'll probably do a virtual). Having refused the diovan hct my cardiologist's partner prescribed (I researched it and found out there was sulfa in the hct so I wasn't able to take it); I just kept pressing for more tests when my cardiologist came back; since my gut was that my high blood pressure could be secondary to something else going on. I did go to the ER (before my dr came back) when my bp reached 175/98; and i asked for some basic blood work just to see if there was an infection somewhere in my body; but nothing showed up and they; too; said take diovan. I refused. I had more extensive blood work when my cardiologist came back; and I had elevated aldosterone; but not renin; and high cholesterol (216) and ldl (142). Before the blood work came back; I had a renal doppler sonogram; and it showed there was a blocked artery to my left kidney. I saw the dr who read it; and he was perplexed because my symptoms were atypical for this except for the hypertension (my kidney was not small or shrunken; and the blockage was not typically where one would be). He said he could have made a mistake in reading it (I appreciated his honesty); and he didn't want to do an angiogram (due to my dye allergy) or angioplasty (heaven forbid!) until he knew for sure it was renal artery stenosis; so he ordered an MRI with gadolinium (which although there is not supposed to be a reaction to it - Bayer could not guarantee it - but they did say to make sure there was no kidney disease first - my egfr and creatinine were normal so they said it should be fine). However; my bp is now up to 170-185 at night over a diastolic of anywhere from 98-120). When I get up in the morning it can be as high as 170 as well. It is so frightening. The original med (diovan) was contraindicated for renal hypertension so I was glad I stood my ground and never took it. I do feel there is a missing component to all this. About 4 weeks ago; once I heard about the hypertension issues; I was petrified; and I immediately started to clean up my diet and exercise. I gave up green tea; and coffee (which I rarely drank) and just have been drinking alkaline water. Within 10 days; I lost close to 14 pounds (which I've been dying to do for the past few years but was unable to). I've been doing fresh squeezed veggie juice on occasion; lots of fruit; veggies; nonfat yogurt and minimal protein. I was taking a lot of vitamins; omega 3 fish oils and probiotics and my stools were formed and dark due to the vitamins (I stopped a lot of this in fear that anything I was previously doing might be causing the hypertension). Two weeks into the diet cleanup (up to then my bm's were still okay); while I went to pick my daughter up from camp; I noticed a complete change in my bowels. I was at the hotel; and suddenly I wasn't forming a solid stool. I had only eaten fish; and some broccoli. The small cluster of feces was beige and looked like dog kibble (round little pellets all together in a round ball - you could see the individual pellets). It scared me; and of course my bp was elevated that entire weekend. Since then; I've been eating; still losing weight; have no stomach pain (except for some soreness to the right of my belly button which has been there about 4-5 years) and still no bm. I walk about 45-60 minutes every other day; and I really don't feel bloated or feel like I have an urge to go to the bathroom. My stomach is as flat as its ever been and not swollen or bloated. I began getting worried about not going to the bathroom; and so I took some large doses of vitamin C to try and go; and all that came out was mostly water and very little broken up feces. I urinate frequently (always have). I kept eating; lost more weight; and had 2 little dark strips come out and felt it was an incomplete evacuation. Yesterday; I took some prune juice at night; and more water and broken up black pieces of feces within the water came out (I could also see some pieces of granola in there as I've eaten lots of fiber - allbran; granola; ground flaxseeds and oat bran which didn't produce any bm). I asked the cardiologist and vascular surgeon if there could be any relation between the potential renal artery stenosis and this constipation problem. I told them I hadn't gone in 2 weeks; and they didn't think it was related. Tonight I had 2 little strips come out that were tan; and that really panicked me. I took more prune juice and again all that came out was water and some orange colored broken up minimal feces (I had eaten an omelet this morning with tomatoes and artichokes and chili peppers; cayenne and tumeric which would account for the orange color). That is what scared me; because usually chili peppers cause me to go to the bathroom easily. Should I go to the ER to see if I have an intestinal blockage? Could this all be from the change in diet? Would the best diagnostic test for now be xray or ct scan? I don't have an internist right now; so I would have to find someone to evaluate me asap. I am supposed to have the MRI with gadolinium next Tuesday; August 18th and now I'm scared of doing that in case there is some blockage in my intestines which might interfere with the test. It's so stressful and confusing; and I just feel it all might be related and causing the hypertension. One last thing; I had a fibroadenoma in my breast last January as well; and they used an ultrasound needle biopsy and then inserted a titanium clip in my breast. I mentioned it to my gynecologist as perhaps a possibility for all these problems; but she said titanium is usually very safe.

872,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 39-year-old female who has had episodes of chest pain; abdominal pain; and shortness of breath since 2000. I have a history of seronegative RA and am currently being worked up for dermatomyositis due to myopathic changes in the upper extremities on EMG. I also have been treated for Lyme Disease. I have a complicated history and it is hard for me to know what is ""important"". My paternal grandfather died of a massive coronary and my maternal grandmother has severe hypertension. Otherwise; I am unsure of any family history of heart disease. I have been seen in the ER many times for chest and abdominal pain and have had several ""borderline"" and ""abnormal"" EKG's. In 2000; it was ""sinus tachycardia and left atrial enlargement"". In 2001; it was ""normal sinus rhythm/right atrial enlargement/nonspecific ST abnormality"". I had several episodes of chest pain and was given nitro to take which did help. (I was also on Vioxx at this time and had intermittent high blood pressure and after stopping Vioxx in 2004; my symptoms improved quite a lot. ) I was referred for a stress test and a gated perfusion study which was WNL at 54%. I have no details on the findings of the stress test portion. I was referred to cardiology (this was all at a military hospital) and started on Atenolol with a diagnosis of ""palpitations and tachycardia"". I had a Holter monitor which was interpreted as invalid because one lead was not on right or something. My doctor moved and I was told that follow up was not necessary. I stopped the Atenolol and just went on with life. Later that same year I was treated in the ER for severe abdominal pain after eating. I had pelvic phleboliths and it was assumed that it was a kidney stone. I never passed a stone; but did assume this was correct due to hematuria and a UTI shortly thereafter. I have continued to have intermittent chest pain; sharp transient abdominal pain; and shortness of breath. EKG in 2002 showed ""normal sinus rhythm"". EKG in 2005 prior to knee surgery showed ""arrhythmia/ ST depression/nonspecific ST changes"". I was not even aware of this until recently. Dizziness started in December 2006 and continues intermittently. As part of my workup for dermatomyositis; I underwent CT scan of the chest; abdomen; and pelvis. This showed atheroslerosis. My question is could the atherosclerosis cause the symptoms I have been experiencing? I continue with intermittent chest and abdominal pain (always after eating but not all the time) ulcer workups have been negative and I have stopped all anti-inflammatories; shortness of breath; and dizziness. I also notice that when I am angry; stressed; or exercise intensely I become more symptomatic. So what is the proper workup for me at this point? Should I see a cardiologist?

873,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have been taking a beta blocker; 50 mg Metoprolol ER (Extended/Slow Release); for several years but have with my cardiologist approval today refilled my BB prescription with Metoprolol Tartrate (normal release) to be taken at 25 mg twice a day (every 12 hours). My reason is driven mainly by the fact the Tartrate is about 1/6th the cost of the Suc (ER). That said; I wonder if I will not in fact have a more ""level"" medication concentration taking the 25 mg twice rather than the 50 mg ER once a day. I think there is a good possibility that I'll have a more uniform medication concentration (on average) taking the Tartrate twice a day. Or; I have my doubts about how well a ER holds up over 24 hours. I doubt that I'll have anything to report; i.e.; there will not be any change in my symptoms that I can detect. So this post is more a question/discussion point. It seems I have the same opportunity to save money on my CCB by taking a normal release at half the dose twice a day.

874,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was recently dx with Mild LVH. I have had mildly elevated BP in the past; but now it is under control; usually ranging 112-114/74-78. I currently take Propranolol for the BP and it seems to be working well.

The stress test was neg. for any other problems. Is mild LVH no big deal; could I ""keel"" over from this? I am thinking that if my Dr. does not seem to cencerned of it; then why should I?

875,Atenolol+hypertension,After telling my new Dr. about my family history of heart disease and explaining an incident a few years ago where I had chest pains; I was instructed to have an EKG and an echocardiogram. My EKG was normal and although my echo stated no valvular heart disease it stated I had mild mitral regurgitation and a trace of tricuspid regurgitation. After reseaching on the internet I do better understand what this means. But my main question is this; I am young; 25 years old; and wanting to know if mild matral regurgitation is something that usually gets worse with time or if even in my 50's; or 60's I still have a good chance of it being mild? My father; along with a few others in my family; had a heart arrythmia and atherosclorosis. And my father passed away from cardiac arrest at the age of 52; so I'm sure you can see my concern.

I worry about HCM; though no family history whatsoever; long livers on both sides; average probably about 88 years; though a few have lived to 98/99.I have a connective tissue disease AS. Is it possible that my CTD could actually be responsible for the mild LVH; rather than mild HTN? I consider my HTN very controlled ; it's probably been averaging around 115/75 the last few years. I've also been diagnosed with costochondritis and FM secondary to my CTD; Could these have any link or be contributing factors for my intermittant palpitations (PVCs & tachycardia)? These are also very controlled with atenolol and losartan. I have an history of life long epsiodes of tachycardia & PVCs and rapid heartrates.I do have anxiety issues which doesn't help. I have a very slight intermittant delta wave is lead ll on my ECG ; barely noticable; normal on computer printout and cardio assessment but I've been told I don't have WPW; any opinions or thoughts? Are intermittent delta waves common without a diagnosis of WPW? My last echo was done in July 2005; I was told by my cardio to have another in 2 years; Do you think with the info provided that this is a reasonable time or I should have one earlier? I'm a bit worried about HCM; but I've been assured by my cardio I don't have that.

879,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 64 year old male. I don't smoke or drink. And eat a healthy diet. Weight is 188 lbs. All heart numbers ( cholesterol; etc. ) are better than average. I do have a L-BBB and some Palps; PAC's and ectopic beats. Recently; I had a stress [ tread-mill ] test; ECG; etc. and two nuclear heart scans. [ One under stress and one not. ] I did better than average on the tread-mill stress test. My pulse was 146. My BP remained a decent number as well. However; the nuclear heart scans showed some degree of Dilated Cardiomyopathy. My Ejection Fraction number is 42%. I am scheduled to have a 2-D Echocardiogram next week. If the Echo comes out reasonably okay; do I have too much to worry about? I have been cleared to have daily mild to moderate exercise. I take 75 mgs of Atenolol daily and have been for several years. My BP is usually 120/72. I have a low pulse rate. I suspect they may put my on an ACE Inhibitor for the Dilated Cardiomyopathy. At this point; ( I don't think they know what has caused my Dilated Cardiomyopathy. ) Thanks for this site and your help.,2000,2007,,,,,I 64 year old male I dont smoke drink and eat healthi diet weight 188 lb all heart number cholesterol etc better averag I lbbb palp pac ectop beat recent I stress treadmil test ecg etc two nuclear heart scan one stress one I better averag treadmil stress test My puls 146 My BP remain decent number well howev nuclear heart scan show degre dilat cardiomyopathi My eject fraction number 42 I schedul 2D echocardiogram next week If echo come reason okay I much worri I clear daili mild moder exercis I take 75 mg atenolol daili sever year My BP usual 12072 I low puls rate I suspect may put ace inhibitor dilat cardiomyopathi At point I dont think know caus dilat cardiomyopathi thank site help
880,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been taking Xanax and/or Klonopin off and on since November 2005. I am physically addicted to the stuff and wish to get off of all benzos; period. Problem is; I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS); a type of autonomic nervous system dysfunction that causes my body to produce too much adrenalin; which makes my anxiety worse. The benzos helped both my anxiety and my POTS in the beginning; but now they do nothing; the only reason I take them is to keep myself from withdrawing. I keep on needing to go higher and higher in order to get the desired effect; and I am now on Xanax 2mg per day. I don't take Klonopin anymore because it doesn't help my anxiety like the Xanax; and it made my heart race (up to 108 bpm) on several occasions. I have to get off of the Xanax now; but its half-life is so short that it's virtually impossible. Trying to lower the dosage aggravates my condition; causing my heart to beat even faster and making my PVC's worse. What should I do in order to get off of this stuff? P.S. I also take Atenolol 50mg (a beta blocker) and Lexapro 5mg (an SSRI) which really help to keep my condition under control.

881,Atenolol+hypertension,"Twice in the past month I had to go to my local Urgent Care clinic for sudden cardiac symptoms. I think I received inappropriate triage and I and considering sending a letter to the medical director of the clinic. I would like the opinion of someone in the medical field to review my concerns and help me determine if my perception is valid. My only intent on sending the letter is to inform the director and that hopefully the staff will receive some training. On the first occasion; I experienced a sudden tachycardia with exertion that was not relieved by rest. My heart rate was 150. When I checked in and told the receptionist my symptoms; I was not questioned further about other symptoms other than ""are you light-headed;"" which I was earlier but had improved on the ride to the clinic. That was the only question I was asked. I was told to have a seat and wait my turn. It turns out that I was having a sudden hypertensive episode (196/126). I have no other history of hypertension. I had a normal EKG and some lab work; and my BP was down to about 150/95 when I went home. I saw my own doc 2 days later and was prescribed an event monitor for 30 days. 3 weeks later (and with normal blood pressure during these 3 weeks) I experienced an afternoon of very frequent palpitations; and a sudden increase of blood pressure at home of 190/110 (in the interim I bought a BP cuff for use at home). I went back to the same Urgent Care; told the receptionist I was wearing a heart monitor; that I had increased palpitations; and that my blood pressure was suddenly increased to 190/110. I was not questioned further and was told to have a seat and wait my turn. I saw my own doc the next day. I am now on atenolol and awaiting lab results on a 24 hr. urine for metanephrines. So; again; my question is; am I correct in my perception of having received inappropriate triage; and should I write my letter to the medical director?

882,Atenolol+hypertension,I was discharged this afternoon from a local large hospital's cardiac care unit. There was some disagreement between a couple of doctors as to the significance of these rhythms. I understand that a PVC by itself is nothing; and even a short term Bigeminal or Triplet series is nothing to write home about. However; I was admitted 2 days ago; after a multi-hour stay in another small hospital's ER while they monitored a very long non-stop series of these beats. I was eventually transferred to an unfamiliar hospital's care. During the hour-long ambulance ride; these same arrythmias continuously occurred... sufficient to raise the eyebrows of the EMTs and the receiving hospital's ER team on my way to the ccu. I should add here that I have a history of hypertension; high cholesterol; and a typical rhythm of sinus bradycardia. I am trim; in my 40s; male; and have a family history of heart disease and hyperlipidemia (among other things...). I am currently on Toprol XL; but I don't know if that is best for this situation. I have been researching this issue and there seems to be a lot of contradictory information. The doctors themselves seemed to diagree with one another. One cardiologist said that these rhythms in my case are significant; and another from the same group said that they were not significant; that the heart is healthy and forget I was even told these results in multiple facilities by different professionals. The doctor who seemed to think that the condition should be treated was talking about medication and if that does not work then possibly an ICD. The other doctor wouldn't even talk about the rhythms saying that they were normal. I was given nitro after a stress-test today; and this seemed to control the beats for about 3 hours. Then they slowly started again. Now; I am not ignorant about my health and my heart. I know what is normal; and this was definitely NOT normal. I would not have bothered going to an ER over one or two PVCs. This was hour-long+ periods accompanied by shortness of breath and some pressure and mild pain. Unfortunately; the physician who ordered my transfer to his hospital is the one who doesn't think there is a problem (he viewed the ER ecg and other tests before he authorized the transfer). He was also the one who discharged me three hours ago. I spent 2 days in hospitals only to walk away with a very big question. What should I do next? I am not interested in playing doctor against doctor. All I want to know is which one was more likely to be right so I can pursue that course of action. Some information on the net supports both opinions! It is hard to decide what to do. If I do choose to ignore this problem; are there any warning signs that I should look for with these multiple pvcs that should not be ignored? My usual warning signs are already there... chest discomfort; shortness of breath; palps; etc. If I do not ignore the problem and seek treatment; is it likely that the medication and/or ICD can shorten my life-expectancy as some doctors (on the net) claim. Now; only after 3 hours following discharge; I have spent two hours of them same arrythmias and some tachycardia. Not only do they not seem normal; they are annoying!

883,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; my name is Nicole. On friday 12/05 ; when I was at work I became slightly lightheaded and my heart was beating higher then normal. This experience precipitated what I believe to be a panic attack. My heart was racing; flushed; sweating; waves of terror; etc. However this feeling of a racing heart did not go away and the next afternoon I had my boyfriend take me to the ER because I still felt like my heart was pounding. On the EKG they gave me my HR was 117 BPM; the PR interval was 179 ms; the QRS duration was 71 ms and the QT was 308 ms and the QTc was 430 ms. I am wondering if all of these numbers are normal. The doctors were specifically looking for Wolff-Parkinson's-White because my father had this; so I am wondering if they overlooked anything. I definitely do not have WPW; as this is the third time I've been checked since I was a child. They said I was dehydrated. After this trip the feeling of a racing heart continued and on wednesday night I ended up in the ER again because of tetany ( apparently hyperventilation-induced) while I was driving. I don't mean to sound like a hypochondriac; but it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. SO after all of this the feeling of the racing heart has gone down to somewhat normal. I am just wondering if all these things could be produced by anxiety; and if my ekg numbers are normal; especially the QT and Qtc numbers. My general practitioner gave me a prescription for Inderal LA 60 mg and xanax; but before I start taking them regularly I would just like a second opinion.,2008,2008,20.0,Female,,,Hi name nicol On friday 1205 I work I becam slightli lighthead heart beat higher normal thi experi precipit I believ panic attack My heart race flush sweat wave terror etc howev feel race heart go away next afternoon I boyfriend take ER I still felt like heart pound On ekg gave HR 117 bpm PR interv 179 ms qr durat 71 ms QT 308 ms qtc 430 ms I wonder number normal the doctor specif look wolffparkinsonswhit father I wonder overlook anyth I definit wpw third time ive check sinc I child they said I dehydr after trip feel race heart continu wednesday night I end ER tetani appar hyperventilationinduc I drive I dont mean sound like hypochondriac scariest thing ever happen SO feel race heart gone somewhat normal I wonder thing could produc anxieti ekg number normal especi QT qtc number My gener practition gave prescript inder LA 60 mg xanax I start take regularli I would like second opinion
884,Atenolol+hypertension,This is; regarding the case of my father in law who is suffering from liposarcoma . A brief case summary; is given below:- My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram; kerla ;India followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumor in his left thigh which was also reamoved next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Only 90% of it could be removed as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.) The pathology report for the thigh tumor and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type ?). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumor is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumor is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumors related to the liposaroma; we took him to Bangalore Instt of Oncology to examine whether Cyber Knife treatment could be of any use. As suggested by them a PET SCAN and DOTATATE test was conducted and the report obtained states that neither CK nor dotattate is possible in his case. I would really appreciate your expert opinion on what further line of treatment is best suited for him which will prolong his life without compromising the quality of life much. 1. Is surgery an option in the given situation ? (followed by Cyber Knife/ chemo) 2.Whether normal radiation method will give him some relief? 3. Are there any other better options we can adopt ? . I await your reply so that we can take further action . Hoping to hear from you soon.

Here is a little more information from my physician. Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further. Any interesting research in this area? Many thanks again. Diana. ====================================================================== Thanks for your additional information. It is quite clear from your posting that there was a lesion to the visual cortex; which is situated in the posterior aspect of the brain. As a ""rule of thumb""; most neurological impairments that have not recovered at six months after the lesion onset will not present much significant improvement afterwards. Having said that; however; a great deal can be accomplished with Occupational Therapy techniques that teach patients to compensate for the existant deficits. Regarding your elegibility for driving; it is very much dependent on each state law; hence it is a question better posed to your neurologist or family physician. I hope this information is helpful.

886,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By ruth on December 22; 1998 at 18:35:11: I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have ""conventional"" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was ""ischemic."" I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore.

887,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello and thank you for reading my post in advance. I have been having a multitude of issues since I was young and it wasn't until lately that I've begun to suspect they may be more related than I thought. I am a 24 year old female who has had hypertension since I was a toddler. As soon as I was old enough; they put me on a alpha-blocker. Later; a beta-blocker was added but alpha blocker was stopped. I am still on atenolol 50 mg daily for this. I have heart palpitations regularly. Around June; I was not stressing and had no caffeinated beverages and while sitting in the middle of my college class I realized I was not breathing well. I then started to get shaky and assumed that I had to eat something as I have often had symptoms of low blood sugar throughout my life and I had not eaten much. When the room started to spin; I grabbed the granola bar in my backpack and went to the bathroom to eat it. By this point; I was feeling the racing and pounding of my heart and nausea was setting in. This was not the first heart episode I had like this. I had one at work before that traveled up my neck and into my head that coworkers could feel just by touching me and another where it seemed like a heart attack. I did not go to the hospital for the first two because I didn't have insurance at the time. This recent time I did because I now do through my college. They saw me at the college clinic right away but by the time I had enough gumption to walk over there I was just very weak and sick feeling. I went to the ER twice that weekend for similar symptoms in which one episode I collapsed and shook violently from cold. The ER made me WAIT hours to be seen in a waiting room with no supervision with this. I fell asleep in the room waiting for the doc and by the time he got there; well I wasn't having the episode. Now; you might be thinking; why isn't this in the cardiology forum? Well I also have had issues with menstruation my entire life. I am married and have been for five years without conceiving with no birth control. Doctors just told me I had PCOS without any testing. They put me on birth controls which drove my blood pressure up. I gave up until after this recent heart episode because that SAME weekend I started what is an ongoing menstruation that only paused yesterday. The OBGYN I saw recently just confirmed for me that I do not have PCOS and no growths in my reproductive tract. When my period restarted today; I had more episodes with my heart. I did see a cardiologist who ran some tests. He said my heart had an extra beat but one is not enough to worry about. He tried a stress test which failed because the drug did not raise my blood pressure enough. I have observed on my own that when I have these episodes; my blood pressure will rise to about 179/140 and drop very quickly. I did some research of my own and I've been reading about pituitary tumors. Some of the symptoms that I have had for years and did not connect seem like they could be related. I have had milky nipple discharge that doctors never seem worried about. I do have headaches behind one eye and have seen halos and what I can only describe as a center point in my vision that light seems to flow towards like ripples. I've never heard or found anything about the odd visual disturbances. I also have arthritic fingers and joints that a doctor told me at 16 I had a marker for rheumatoid arthritis for when I get older and sent me to some useless therapy. (I just live with it for now) and recently I have learned I have sleep apnea. (Been on treatment for about a month with no change to any symptoms) Blood sugar is perfect; btw. I feel that I am WAY too young to be having these problems and it's making me very depressed. I'm desperate to find an answer but doctors just want to treat symptoms. Does it sound like I have a pituitary tumor and if so; what kind of doctor do I need a referral to.

888,Atenolol+hypertension,So today I went to a doctor (not a cardiologist) and showed my Holter results and he said I should take propanolol 10mg for a few months. According to him; I had 14% of the beats in tachycardia; which is too much. Well I tried to explain that I had a busy day when I used the Holter and I even exercised; and the average HR during the 24 hours exam was 81bpm; which in my opinion is not that big (but I'm not a doctor). The Holter caught only 3 PACs and 5 PVCs; but somedays I have a lot lot more; maybe 300-400. Do you think 14% of the time in tachycardia; even if there's no episode of tachycardia for more than a few minutes; is a reason to start taking beta blockers? Should I listen to a second opinion; from a cardiologist? I don't feel like I need to take it; my HR in the night is usually between 55 - 65 so it will likely drop to 40's.... Thanks for your opinions.,2014,2015,,Male,,,So today I went doctor cardiologist show holter result said I take propanolol 10mg month accord I 14 beat tachycardia much well I tri explain I busi day I use holter I even exercis averag HR 24 hour exam 81bpm opinion big Im doctor the holter caught 3 pac 5 pvc someday I lot lot mayb 300400 Do think 14 time tachycardia even there episod tachycardia minut reason start take beta blocker should I listen second opinion cardiologist I dont feel like I need take HR night usual 55 65 like drop 40 thank opinion
889,Atenolol+hypertension,My blood pressure; until last year; was always around 90/60; last year it shot up to 234/198 and I had a three hour nose bleed that was stopped with a coagulate med shot when I was rushed to the hospital. From that point on it fluctuated for a month in the 119/90 area ... until I found a good hypertension Doctor who; after dozens of tests; got it under control with norvasc; it still runs around 140/76; so I have just now had the 5 mg increased to 10mg. I have had atrial Fib; ventrical tachicardia and mitral valve prolaspe for 35 years but was not caught until 10 years later; in the past 15 years it has been under control with atenolol and no more episodes for the past 7 years; just a slight amount of arrythmia once in a while. I; also; have just a very slight irregularity in my atrial heart valve. 4 yrs ago I had tremendous water retension and swelling of my leg after a hip replacement and gained 10 lbs over night. They thought I had heart failure but yearly echos have confirmed that I do not; the echos in 2008 showed I had a slight amount of atrial enlargement; Now; the echo I had yesterday shows my right and left atrial chambers are severly enlarged. I have had some angina pain but I think it is mostly from stress; since I had angina pain yesterday after I was told my heart was now severly enlarged. My weight is very normal; I have no shortness of breath; my endurance is quite good; however; I had to give up my walking 5 miles aday after my hip replacement. I have cooked only mediterranian diet food for 20 years. Is it possible that my blood pressure; even though not really high is causing the enlarged heart? Is it alot more dangerous to have an enlarged heart? Does the enlarged heart mean that I now will have more atrial fib; or other heart problems? Is it possible for me to get my heart size back to normal size and if so; how? What other tests can I take that will give me a guide line on the best things I can do for myself to maintain good heart health inspite of a few heart problems. My mother and father both died with heart problems.,2010,2010,80.0,Female,,,My blood pressur last year alway around 9060 last year shot 234198 I three hour nose bleed stop coagul med shot I rush hospit from point fluctuat month 11990 area I found good hypertens doctor dozen test got control norvasc still run around 14076 I 5 mg increas 10mg I atrial fib ventric tachicardia mitral valv prolasp 35 year caught 10 year later past 15 year control atenolol episod past 7 year slight amount arrythmia I also slight irregular atrial heart valv 4 yr ago I tremend water retens swell leg hip replac gain 10 lb night they thought I heart failur yearli echo confirm I echo 2008 show I slight amount atrial enlarg now echo I yesterday show right left atrial chamber severli enlarg I angina pain I think mostli stress sinc I angina pain yesterday I told heart severli enlarg My weight normal I short breath endur quit good howev I give walk 5 mile aday hip replac I cook mediterranian diet food 20 year Is possibl blood pressur even though realli high caus enlarg heart Is alot danger enlarg heart doe enlarg heart mean I atrial fib heart problem Is possibl get heart size back normal size what test I take give guid line best thing I maintain good heart health inspit heart problem My mother father die heart problem
890,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've read through the archives and know that ""in general"" if there are no underlying conditions that PVCs are benign. I've had them since I was about 13 years old but only once or twice a year. Recentley they started coming (several a day)and some are quite painful;and sometimes I experience what feels like several in a row (10 or so). (I'm 39 now). I frequently experience chest tightness or discomfort before and/or after the PVCs; as well as a host of other symptoms. I had an Echo (15 years ago) which was normal. This year I've had a resting EKG; stress test; wore a Holter monitor and an event monitor. All showed PVCs but the cardiologist said I was fine. Since the ""multiple attacks"" I've been having a lot of trouble dealing with these. He said he thinks it does more harm than good to treat a benign condition with medications. I tend to agree; but even with a psycologist I can't seem to handle these things. The dang things are causing the stress; which causes more PVCs. I'm afraid to exercise and I have heard that PVCs can degrade into VF. I've asked my cardiologist; but he just tells me to see a pshycologist; so I hope that you all can answer these questions: 1. What factors turn PVCs into VFib and do the tests I have had (Stress test; holter and event - echo (10 to 15 years ago)show if I am at risk for this happening to me? 2. Dr. won't give meds and I don't drink; smoke; eat caffine or chocolate; Tha Chi for stress etc. so are there any ""natural"" remedies to help ease these things?

891,Atenolol+hypertension,Happy New Year; Last night had a very frightening experience; laying in bed had what I normally felt like a pvc; anyway my heart basically started to feel like it was quivering. I reach to take my pulse for a few seconds i couldn't find one; then despite this irregular quivering of my heartbeat; my pulse was regular at least fairly regular and had good volume. Is it possible it might have been a-fib with a fairly regular pulse or interpolated pvcs occuring without a pause? I know it would be impossible to know for sure without a ecg tracing or holter; only had this particular feeling about 8 years last about the same lenght of time about 5-10 minutes. I was really alarmed; my wife was shopping so I had to call my sister who lives next door over; she said I looked deathly pale ; though she claims she experineces the same feeling quite often. It went away quite quickly; I decided not to go to the ER unless it returned; thankfully so far it has not. I skipped my atenolol and cozaar last night; I have a feeling atenolol might be contributing to these episodes so I have decided to half my atenolol dose and see what happens. I take 100mg daily in divided doses. I suspect it could be the culprit; any thoughts? Medical history . have AS; a connective tissue disease. Heart evaluation echo; stess test and ecg. normal ; besides mild LVH. ECG and echo within the last 6 months ; stress test 4 years ago.mild hypertension (very controlled) Do this sound like it might have been V-tach or AIVR; pulse probably 80-90 bpm the whole time?

892,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run. What's going on? Both my Stress Tests and my echo-stress were negative (I ran on the treadmill for a long time-the doctor said no restrictions) SO why is this happening? Should I have a Thallium Stress test to make sure my arteries are O.K? I also heard there was a high-speed CAT scan that shows plaque in the arteries.

897,Atenolol+hypertension,Hell; I hope you are doing well. I am having a problem where I have episodes of severe pain on my left side of my chest. I am 29 YO male and My Doctor says it is chosto chondritis. He has giving me some Celebrex and Vicadin. Neither work. When I feel this pain; (at night when I am trying to go to sleep) It always worries me and I get anxious. It will not go away until it is time for me to go to work the next day. (so I stay up these nights). It is a constant pain over the left chest area sometimes high in the chest and sometimes low. I have had light headed spells that will last all day. And on 2 occassions my left leg has went numb. On 1 ocassion I went to the Er; CAT a cat sckan and EKG showed nothing. I have had blood work done and nothing. My mom was diagnosed at 29 with Leukemia. I remember her telling us after she would go to the docter; before she was diagnosed; that he said it was not her heart. This always hits at night. Usually late and sometimes wakes me up. Everything is going great; money; family; job. Nothing really to be stressed about except the Cowboys and Stars keep losing. What does this sound like to you. I know you can not diagnose me but any advice/suggestions. The pain is pretty intense and usually lasts about 6 hours.,2001,2001,,,,,hell I hope well I problem I episod sever pain left side chest I 29 YO male My doctor say chosto chondriti He give celebrex vicadin neither work when I feel pain night I tri go sleep It alway worri I get anxiou It go away time go work next day I stay night It constant pain left chest area sometim high chest sometim low I light head spell last day and 2 occass left leg went numb On 1 ocass I went Er cat cat sckan ekg show noth I blood work done noth My mom diagnos 29 leukemia I rememb tell us would go docter diagnos said heart thi alway hit night usual late sometim wake everyth go great money famili job noth realli stress except cowboy star keep lose what sound like I know diagnos advicesuggest the pain pretti intens usual last 6 hour
898,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently began having pvc's several times an hour and was started on atenolol 50 mg after being diagnosed with hypertension also. 150's/90's. Now have very few pvc's and B/P 120's/80's. However an echo for checking cause of pvc's revealed mitral valve prolapse with redundacy of posterior leaflet and a moderate mitral regurgitation; trivial tricuspid and trivial pulmonary valve regurgitation. Have had chest pain at times over past 2 years and episodes of shortness of breath with exertion; but not always. Will be having a stress echo next week. If stress echo is normal; what should I expect for follow-up of regurgitation and what is the probability that it will not get worse? 41 y.o. non-smoker; Thank you so much for any info.,2002,2002,,,,,I recent began pvc sever time hour start atenolol 50 mg diagnos hypertens also 150s90 now pvc BP 120s80 howev echo check caus pvc reveal mitral valv prolaps redundaci posterior leaflet moder mitral regurgit trivial tricuspid trivial pulmonari valv regurgit have chest pain time past 2 year episod short breath exert alway will stress echo next week If stress echo normal I expect followup regurgit probabl get wors 41 yo nonsmok thank much info
899,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been having heart palps on and off for two years. I am a 26 yr old woman and perfectly healthy. About a year ago I had a series of tests(EKG; holter monitor;event monitor;echocardiogram)and have seen both and an M.D. and cardiologist. Tests showed PVC's;PAC's; and atrial runs. None of the Drs seemed too concerned. Through my own research and keeping a time line on a calendar I have assumed that they were related to hormones. I usually get them on and off for about a week(sometimes pretty big ones-several times a day) and then nothing for anywhere from 3 wks to 8 mos but they always end up coming back eventually! I have gotten off birth control;do not drink ANY caffine; am not overweight; and am not stressed(except when I have them).After I got off the pill I did not have any for about 8 mos and then last month they started up again w/my period and then left at the end of my cycle(however; they are not always during my perod).

900,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.",2009,2010,,Female,,,My mom 72 year old femal live singapor diagnos hypertens 8 year ago initi control via wellknown BP medic see medic longer prescrib unknown reason In 509 hospit due methyldopa induc cholestasi diagnos atrial fibril In 809 14 day warfarin therapi fell caus unknown suffer skull fractur caus acut subarachnoid subdur hemorrhag she initi paralyz left side she recov almost 90 3 week On request switch warfarin aspirin In 1209 open cholecystectomi due acut cholecyst pigment gallston In 510 minor stroke her eyesight becam blurri vomit twice lost motor control especi left side she discharg hospit 1 2 day she back warfarin cardiologist recruit apaxiban vs warfarin clinic trial back 809 for 2 3 month 510 stroke mom suffer pain left shoulder make difficult sleep night she alway difficulti fall asleep the new medic simvastatin warfarin seem lessen shoulder pain sadli suffer slowli decreas lucid 809 hospit etiolog uncertain she monitor BP 3 time day upon awaken breakfast around 140 In afternoon even around 120 she take BP medicin breakfast ecg result 409 sinu bradycardia atrial prematur complex 509 AF T abnorm 809 hospit cn hemorrhag sinu rhythm 1009 AF T ST abnorm medic befor 510 stroke 30 amlodipin besyl 5 mg lisinopril 40 mg atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 40 mg aspirin 100 mg medic after 510 stroke simvastatin 10mg warfarin she risk chad 1 1 her stroke symptom indic neuro problem shouldnt neurologist main Dr 2 wa stroke like secondari blood clot ie blockag hemorrhag due capillari wall weak secondari either genet propens vascular wall compromis due long term hypertens how determin what test done 3 should statin drug rather regular timetest BP med like origin BP med list dont statin danger sideeffect what proper treatment regimen shouldnt take BP med statin especi warfarin and arent blood thinner possibl contraind histori could reduct pain shoulder caus antiinflammatori effect statin I read numer articl regard danger statin concern
901,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question. I am a bit confused as to what most cardiologist consider a normal ejection fraction; I have seen conflicting numbers though the difference being very small. I have seen 50-70% as normal ; then 55-75% as normal. What numbers or % do CCF use? Would you consider an EF of 50% and over normal? The reason I ask my last echo 2 months ago on the printout it showed an Ef of 53%; yet in the doctors office he said my EF was actually 55-60%; when I received a copy of the echo report it said 53%; I called and asked him about the difference in the printout and what he told me; he said my Ef was what he told me 55-60% and the number on the printout was of no significance; that I had no signs of cardiomyopathy. Even if my Ef 53% ; would you still consider that normal? From what i gather most centers and cardiologist consider 50% and above normal; though I seen guidelines with the low being 55%; this is confusing;I just some clarification. My EF 5 years was 65-70%; I understand it can vary; he told me that time I was more nervous and that my heart was a bit hyperkinetic then; Would you agree that increased anxiety with your heart punding harder ; even if no that much faster can increase your EF? I was told 5 years ago I had borderline hypertrophy at 12mm interventricular septum; now the printout shows 14mm; he told me my hypertrophy was mild; this was the only thing that was out of range on my echo; all other measurements was normal. I do push ups regularly to keep my back straight because of a CTD I have; Would this cause mild LVH?

902,Atenolol+hypertension,I have posted before in this forum and also want to thank the doctors and other people who are so informative and supportive. My question is this. I don't drink alcohol often but when I do I tend to drink to much. Friday within a period of the evening from 7:00 P.M. to 3:00 P.M. I consumed 3 bottles of white wine. Of course I did not feel well the next day. But; Sunday and Monday I felt pain with nausea all day. I was wondering if maybe the dehydration had something to do with increasing PVC's and nausea. I have also had nausea alot when I haven't drank alcohol too. I just had a 30 day event monitor and it had runs of trigeminy; alot of PVC's and sinus tachycardia. I had alot on holter 18;000 in 24 hours. They are getting much more painful now and the doctor also has be on .05 xanax for night. I have also been experiencing alot of joint pain in back and knees. Could the drugs be causing this. I think I have asked this before but I don't think I got an answer. When you have this many episodes does it cause you to be tired and lethargic or would that be side effects from meds. I am also on hyzarr(50 ml) a day for blood pressure. I am a 45 year old white female with full hysterectomy fours years ago. I am not on any hormone replacement. But; I have had every test known to man for my heart and seems like everything is fine. I am about 30 lbs overweight though. When wearing 30 day event it would jump from 85; 145; 240 and back to 71. Is this from PVC's??? I know this is alot to comment but I would really appreciate your imput.

904,Atenolol+hypertension,"6 weeks ago I went to the ER with Chest Discomfort; BP Was high (240/120). Labs; X-Ray; EKG normal. Background 35 yr old male. Borderline hypertension most of the time.; LDL 150; total 230. Non-smoker. About 20 lbs overweight; exercise regularly. I'm still getting chest pains; mainly shooting in nature; bi-lateral; but occasionally dead center and it's pressure. 1. They did a nuclear stress echo with exercise; said everything looked normal. EF 60%. How often do false negatives show up? 2. I'm belching constantly. Many times it relieves the dead center chest pain. However the upper chest shooting pains come and go. Should this belching help ease my mind this is not caridac? 3. Lately I ""feel"" like my heart is fluttering sometimes. I've gotten lightheaded a few times; however I do acknowledge that the ER trip and these pains have my anxiety through the roof. My internist wants me to get an upper GI scope; mentioned this could be my esophogus. I've been on prilosec for 6 weeks with little change though; might even be worse. Is the upper GI scope the next logical step? 4. Should I push for a cardiology consult? My understanding is that angina or MI pains are not shooting in nature(most of mine are under 5 seconds) with the exception of a few times I had this center chest pain. I've already had an exercise stress with nuclear done that was clean. The next steps would be an echo; or cath correct? Would any cardiologist realisically do either with my symptoms? 5.

905,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed 10 years ago with mitral valve prolapse. I awoke one night shortly after the birth of my third child with symptoms suggestive of a heart attack. I went to the ER and was told everything was okay. I consulted with a cardiologist and was told I had MVP. I was put on medication. The history after that with this problem was that I was on and off medication due to side effects. I would have symptoms of rapid heart beating and put on medication for that. I saw manycardiologists and doctors over the years. Some would say on the basis of listening that I definitely DID NOT have MVP. Some would say I did. I continued to take SBE prophylaxis over that entire time as a safeguard. Recently I have been having more symptoms and they have worsened. I have gained weight and also have developed high blood pressure. I had one episode that I had to call the EMTs for and they said that it registered on the rhythm strips that I was having SVT. At the hospital it only registered as sinus tachycardia but it rain in the 130-150s for about 2 hours then down to 110-120s for the next two and finally leveling off in the low 100s. I went to another cardiologist after this and was just told today (by a nurse) that the echocardiogram shows no MVP but shows mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. In the last few months I have had lots of tests including EKGs; 24-hour Holter; Thallium scan; and now this echocardiogram. I had one cardiologist about three months ago do the thallium; 24-hour monitor; and EKG and said i didnt need an ECHO. He said from listening that i DEFINITELY HAD MVP and that I needed to take SBE prophylaxis! After this episode with the SVT I decided to get a second opinion altogether and upon physical exam by the new cardiologist he says I DEFINITELY DONT have MVP but he performed this ECHO and the reading says now I have mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. This doctor put me on Verapamil to help with the blood pressure and the arrhythmia and tachycardia problems. My question to you is WHY all the discrepancies. What am I to believe? How serious is this? I understand that it can be progressive and can need repair? I would just like some general information so that I will know what kind of questions to ask him when I go in for my follow-up appt. in about a week. I am very perplexed and concerned that anyone really knows what is going on with me. I have a VERY STRONG family history for heart disease of all sorts including in m y father alone stroke;CAD;CHF; Pacemaker! so I really would like to try to avoid these problems if possible.

906,Atenolol+hypertension,"Dear Dr. Lately it seems that my heart rate is taking longer to return to resting after exercise than usual. For the last several weeks; I exercise at 140-150 bpm for 45-50 minutes; and after 15 minutes cool down; my heart rate is still in 120-130 range. It used to come down to 110 or so after that time. I'll admit that I tend to panic if my heart rate is in any way suspect; but I think I am seeing a difference in the last few weeks. I take a diuretic for high BP; and I wonder if I may be dehydrated; but there has no change in BP medication in last several weeks. Also; 3 months ago my doctor increased my thyroid medication; so this may be a factor. Other than post-exercise; my pulse is behaving nicely. I had an echo 2 years ago that was ""normal"".

However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of ""attack"" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor.

I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor.

909,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have periods of persistent atrial fibrillation. The first was in 2010 and was successfully cardioversed precisely after six months. The second period was in spring 2012 and was cardioversed after six weeks' warfarin treatment. The present period is going on now (from 6. January) and will be cardioversed after 7 weeks from the beginning. An electric cardioversion immediately after the onset of AF is possible only when one is 100% sure that it has not lasted more than 48 h. Otherwise one must be on Warfarin (Marevan) so that INR is on the therapeutic level at least for three weeks. At all times of my AF; I have had INR on the therapeutic level (2-3) soon and mainteined it there for all the AF time (and a few extra months). At the meantime I have used ""children's aspirin). Is it good to keep people with AF for too long times? Why do doctors not study causes of AF? I myself have suggested eg. dehydration; infections and hyperparathyroidism for causes of AF. I have not had thorough heart studies and discussions in a hospital. I have organized them at sevearal private doctors' offices. When people go to electric cardioversion to the hospital; it is performed in a steady stream with only short discussion with the doctor. ECG has been done several times. I have a small leakage of mitral valve. During the second period of AF the leakage was possibly slightly larger than during the first AF. With AF; my pulmonary pressure rises and left atrium enlarges. ProBNP rises at least to over 2400. Doctors did not begin to measure it; I ordered the measurement myself. But the rise does not matter. I have respiratory difficulties. After the six-month AF in 2010 the left atrium; however; shrank to normal (in 2011). Enlargement of the left atrium is thus not a cause of my AF but a consequence. Is it good to keep me with AF? My blood pressure and pulse have always been very variable. I am now 65 years. In the nineteen eighties I often had paroxysmal tachycardia. Atenolol was begun and I am still using it. Possibly I got CFS (ME) in the eighties. At the change of 2009-2010 I had some infections; and before the AF period in 2010 I ordered a test for autonomic nervous system. In 1/3-maximal grip (maximal was 30.4) test my blood pressure was 259/140 (at rest before the test 153/80). The increase was: systolic 106 mmHg and diastolic 57. In Valsalva test pulse reaction was weak. In deep breathing test respiratory arhythmia was weaker than normal. In orthostatic test blood pressure reactions were strong: at 30 sec systolic +47 and at 3 min systolic +87. Atenolol 50 mg and Thyroid 2;5 G were in use. As a conclusion of the autonomous nersvous systen test it was said that; the result did not clearly deviate from normal. The weak pulse reaction can result from already high pulse at the beginning. Maybe sympaticotonia causes the greater blood pressure increase and the higher pulse. My blood pressure and pulse are very variable during the AF; and also without AF. During AF my diastolic pressure is sometimes increased. Sometimes; when sitting; my blood pressure varies between 98/71 and 141/109. In an ambulatory (24 h) blood pressure test (without atenolol) in 2006; my systolic pressure varied between 98 and 228 (mean 141). Diastolic pressure varied varied between 44-113 (mean 84). The pulse varied between 64 and 137 (mean 91). I was ashtonished; because my pulse pressure minimum and maximum were 14 and 134!! Why? I have chronic sinusitis. At the change of 2012-2013 I have had dyspnea and respiratory infection and norovirus. I have some inconsistency in my iron status. I have not iron deficiency but have small and pale red cells. Maybe I have slight secondary anemia due to infections. I have too low IgG3 and complement lectin pathway. I have nodules in my lungs. They have not increased in size during two years. I am on thyroid medication (Thyroid Erfa). Partial diabetes insipidus could not be excluded in a water deprivation test. I have Sjoegren's syndrome and cervical dystonia. The latest diagnosis is too thick endometrium. I am using 25 mcg estrogen and every second month progesterone (Terolut). When I on January 6 2013 was in the Emergency unit; my red cell count was 5.52; hemoglobin 153 and hematocrit 0.45. Na+ was 146 (137-144 normal!); fP-gluc 6;6 (!; no diabetes). I think that I was dehydrated. My dehydration may be due to partial diabetes insipidus; hyperparathyroidism; or vitamin D. Vitamin D intake was increased early in autumn 2012 from 25 mcg to 50 mcg. Then I had; according to a doctor; to increase D-vitamin intake to 100. At the end of 2012 I had increased it to 75 mcg; and then I was one day at 100 mcg. I did not feel good and dropped it back to 75 mcg on the next day. Then early in the morning of the next day (Jan 6) I found atrial fibrillation. I dropped the vitamin to 50 mcg. Then I once tried to take 75 again and got polyuria and thirst; and dropped it back to 50 mc. It can be suggested that the vit D increase was a cause for the onset of AF. ???",2011,2013,,Female,,,I period persist atrial fibril the first 2010 success cardiovers precis six month the second period spring 2012 cardiovers six week warfarin treatment the present period go 6 januari cardiovers 7 week begin An electr cardiovers immedi onset AF possibl one 100 sure last 48 h otherwis one must warfarin marevan inr therapeut level least three week At time AF I inr therapeut level 23 soon maintein AF time extra month At meantim I use children aspirin Is good keep peopl AF long time whi doctor studi caus AF I suggest eg dehydr infect hyperparathyroid caus AF I thorough heart studi discuss hospit I organ sevear privat doctor offic when peopl go electr cardiovers hospit perform steadi stream short discuss doctor ecg done sever time I small leakag mitral valv dure second period AF leakag possibl slightli larger first AF with AF pulmonari pressur rise left atrium enlarg probnp rise least 2400 doctor begin measur I order measur but rise matter I respiratori difficulti after sixmonth AF 2010 left atrium howev shrank normal 2011 enlarg left atrium thu caus AF consequ Is good keep AF My blood pressur puls alway variabl I 65 year In nineteen eighti I often paroxysm tachycardia atenolol begun I still use possibl I got cf ME eighti At chang 20092010 I infect AF period 2010 I order test autonom nervou system In 13maxim grip maxim 304 test blood pressur 259140 rest test 15380 the increas systol 106 mmhg diastol 57 In valsalva test puls reaction weak In deep breath test respiratori arhythmia weaker normal In orthostat test blood pressur reaction strong 30 sec systol 47 3 min systol 87 atenolol 50 mg thyroid 25 G use As conclus autonom nersvou systen test said result clearli deviat normal the weak puls reaction result alreadi high puls begin mayb sympaticotonia caus greater blood pressur increas higher puls My blood pressur puls variabl AF also without AF dure AF diastol pressur sometim increas sometim sit blood pressur vari 9871 141109 In ambulatori 24 h blood pressur test without atenolol 2006 systol pressur vari 98 228 mean 141 diastol pressur vari vari 44113 mean 84 the puls vari 64 137 mean 91 I ashtonish puls pressur minimum maximum 14 134 whi I chronic sinus At chang 20122013 I dyspnea respiratori infect noroviru I inconsist iron statu I iron defici small pale red cell mayb I slight secondari anemia due infect I low igg3 complement lectin pathway I nodul lung they increas size two year I thyroid medic thyroid erfa partial diabet insipidu could exclud water depriv test I sjoegren syndrom cervic dystonia the latest diagnosi thick endometrium I use 25 mcg estrogen everi second month progesteron terolut when I januari 6 2013 emerg unit red cell count 552 hemoglobin 153 hematocrit 045 Na 146 137144 normal fpgluc 66 diabet I think I dehydr My dehydr may due partial diabet insipidu hyperparathyroid vitamin D vitamin D intak increas earli autumn 2012 25 mcg 50 mcg then I accord doctor increas dvitamin intak 100 At end 2012 I increas 75 mcg I one day 100 mcg I feel good drop back 75 mcg next day then earli morn next day jan 6 I found atrial fibril I drop vitamin 50 mcg then I tri take 75 got polyuria thirst drop back 50 mc It suggest vit D increas caus onset AF
910,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 27 year old female; 6'1; and 310 lbs. Yes; I am fat- but please don't focus in on that. For the last three weeks I have been having daily ""spells."" I become very discombobulated; my vision blurs; eyes loose focus; feel disconnected from my body. Most times; I am able to get to the floor of my own accord and wait out the feelings. Twice they hit so suddenly; I crumpled loosing conciousness for a fraction of a second (standing to prone is blank). For a few of these episodes there were nursing staff quickly on hand that checked my BP and pulse (bottom number on BP elevated; pulse pretty normal). I have been to ER; urgent care; and my PCP; the only thing they have been able to tell me is that I'm having episodes of near syncope. The EKGs have all been good; blood work- fine; urinalisis- good; thyroide-operational; and event monitor shows normal readings. Spell symptoms include: light head; sinus pressure; head aches; tingling hands and feet; chest pain (both sides; not just heart area); numbness across shoulders and down arms; brown outs; eye strain/pain; heavy head; tingling scalp; feel like moving through sludge; extreme exhaustion; loss of motor control; thick tongue feeling; difficult to speak and understand; and occasionally bright/dark/wiggle spots in vision. Post spells I am usually completely exhausted (can sleep for hours); disoriented; loss of concentration; blurred vision; pin and needles- all of these can go on for hours. I have spent the last three days in a constant state of dreaminess; like my mind and body are moving independently; have had several minor spells; and what worries me- my finger nails have started turning blue. Both my hand and my feet will become cold as ice within seconds of being immobile- the nails have started to turn a deep indigo blue shade as well. I've read many other posts about people having some of these symptoms; but I can't seem to see any solutions. Additionally; I have a few other worries to throw in. I ""had"" blood clots in Sep '07; superficial- documented with ultrasound. The clots were still there; in the exact same place; when they were looked at again (ultrasound) in Nov '08. When I had my first spell; three weeks ago; the urgent care did a blood test and said that the clots were gone now. The pain; fatigue; and throbbing in my leg was just because of the vericose veins- said the Dr. It's not the same kind of pain as the veins have given me before. I have polycystic kidney disease; hypertension (treated with atenolol; 25mg-4yrs); and chronic sinusitis. I've tried to get the doctor to consider looking at my sinuses; CTing my kidneys (due to increased abnormal pain); or changing my atenolol. They all just keep going in circles about my heart because of the chest pains. I'm incredibly frustrated as I have been taken off the work schedule until released by my PCP and she is doing nothing to help my figure all this out. My depression is getting worse; I'm starting to worry myself- which is causing more anxiety- which isn't helping my current condition. I have spoken to multiple DRs and nurses about the atenolol side effects I had experienced and they all tell me that they've ""never heard of anyone having that reaction before."" As the abnormal weight gain (about 60lbs in 1 1/2yrs); sluggishness; moodiness; and depression are all on the list of side effect to speak to your DR about on the med description- I'm confused. I realize that this is probably a needlessly long and rambling post; chock full of irrelevant information- but; please; don't let that deter anyone from giving whatever advice or useful thoughts you may have. I really need help with this; I'm reaching the end of my rope trying to get someone to listen and help me.",2009,2009,,,,,Im 27 year old femal 61 310 lb ye I fat pleas dont focu for last three week I daili spell I becom discombobul vision blur eye loos focu feel disconnect bodi most time I abl get floor accord wait feel twice hit suddenli I crumpl loos concious fraction second stand prone blank for episod nurs staff quickli hand check BP puls bottom number BP elev puls pretti normal I ER urgent care pcp thing abl tell Im episod near syncop the ekg good blood work fine urinalisi good thyroideoper event monitor show normal read spell symptom includ light head sinu pressur head ach tingl hand feet chest pain side heart area numb across shoulder arm brown out eye strainpain heavi head tingl scalp feel like move sludg extrem exhaust loss motor control thick tongu feel difficult speak understand occasion brightdarkwiggl spot vision post spell I usual complet exhaust sleep hour disori loss concentr blur vision pin needl go hour I spent last three day constant state dreami like mind bodi move independ sever minor spell worri finger nail start turn blue both hand feet becom cold ice within second immobil nail start turn deep indigo blue shade well ive read mani post peopl symptom I cant seem see solut addit I worri throw I blood clot sep 07 superfici document ultrasound the clot still exact place look ultrasound nov 08 when I first spell three week ago urgent care blood test said clot gone the pain fatigu throb leg vericos vein said Dr it kind pain vein given I polycyst kidney diseas hypertens treat atenolol 25mg4yr chronic sinus ive tri get doctor consid look sinus cting kidney due increas abnorm pain chang atenolol they keep go circl heart chest pain Im incred frustrat I taken work schedul releas pcp noth help figur My depress get wors Im start worri caus anxieti isnt help current condit I spoken multipl dr nurs atenolol side effect I experienc tell theyv never heard anyon reaction As abnorm weight gain 60lb 1 12yr sluggish moodi depress list side effect speak DR med descript Im confus I realiz probabl needlessli long rambl post chock full irrelev inform pleas dont let deter anyon give whatev advic use thought may I realli need help Im reach end rope tri get someon listen help
911,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; just need to ask if anyones knows the best way to reduce a daily dose of 80mg of Propranalol? I take 40mg in the morning and 40mg before bed; but i am beginning to think that this drug; after 6 months of taking it; is starting to play havoc with my circulation. I am constantly feeling dizzy; breathless when try to stand up or move about; simple things cause me to feel unsteady and i often feel like im gona pass out and then have a panic attack. I want to see if it is indeed the Propranalol that is causing it. I want to reduce to 20mg x 2 daily and see if this helps with the symptoms but dont want to do it too quickly causing more side effects.

913,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been experiencing periodic spells of tachycardia off and on for about 6 months now. Was hospitalized overnight once; and all bloodwork; X-Rays; echocardiogram and so forth came back fine. I've been going to see an EP for 3 months now; have worn the event monitor; and all they came up with was sinus tach. My EP hasn't come up with a specific diagnosis; but suspects either Inappropriate Sinus Tach or an Atrial Tach that they haven't caught yet. The highest my pulse has gotten during any attacks has been about 140. At rest it can get as high as 95; up to 115 or so when standing. Exercise or eating doesn't seem to trigger any attacks. I don't have attacks everyday; and since I've been taking betablockers; I rarely ever have them. Resting blood pressure is good; standing as high as 140/100. I've tried 3 different types of betablockers; all low doses; and they all make me feel ill (exhausted; headaches; nightmares and insomnia). No PACs or PVCs that I'm aware of. Oh yes; I'm a 33 year old male; and have been in good shape for the past 18 years. Questions: 1. My EP says these problems may just go away on their own? Is this possible? 2. I'm scared to death of problems with impotence from the betablockers. Should I be concerned? 3. Do calcium channel blockers produce less side effects then betas? 4. Should I even be taking meds for these symptoms; or just deal with it? 5. Has anyone tried supplementing with magnesium or Hawthorn to control arrhythmias? 6. I've read that viral infections may cause arrhythmias.

914,Atenolol+hypertension,Good Morning! I have some questions regaurding my health. Approx 2 1/2 years ago I began to have upper left shoulder pain. An upper GI showed nothing along with a stress echo which did show mild LV enlargement. Acouple of months after these tests the pain moved in mid of sternum;following lightheadiness;and nasua. I had a nuclear stress test which was also negative. In Jan of 2004 I had a heart cath that showed nothing. I have worn a holter monitor that showed pacs and pvc with 1 bout of SVT. My question is that with little excertion my heart pounds and I still have chest pains.I do smoke and blood pressure is usualy around 135/85.I also have thoracic subluxations of the spine. Does this sound like heart related with all tests or something else. Just another question is when I smoke my chest hurts behind the sternum.

I wore a holter during these episodes and it came back fine. I am on Atenolol. I have a few questions though. 1. Will Atenolol weaken my heart over time ? (years) 25 mg. I take it for pvc's. 2. Is the stress echo accurate in woman? I am 34 and otherwise healthy? I have had one regular stress test; an echocardiogram; and two stress echo's. (all within one year) 3. Can panic or anxiety really cause these same symptoms? ( chest/arm pain too?) Every time I go to the Er with these symptoms; my Ekg and enzymes are fine...Any clues?

917,Atenolol+hypertension,"So some of you know that I'm a pain management patient and I took a ""drug holiday"" earlier this month (stopped my meds for 2 weeks in order to restart my tolerance)...I wasn't sure if I was going to refill my script or not; but I did. I don't have a problem abusing my medicine (I take 5mg Norco 3x a day) but I'm tired of having to take them around the clock or end up with withdrawals. So...I'm done. I'm in the middle of my script and when I woke up this morning I got the awful withdrawal-haven't-taken-a-pill-in-a-long-time feeling and I decided that I'm done. I made an appointment with my GP tomorrow and I need to know what to ask her..I'm going to ask for some medicine to help me deal with the withdrawals. I'm stopping cold turkey this weekend. We're moving into a new house and we're goin to be painting and putting down carpet and moving...but this is the best time for me to do it. I need to keep busy or I will start having panic attacks - I take the medicine for legitimate pain reasons and the thought of dealing with the pain without medicine has me panicked even now; so I know that I need to keep busy or I'll cave and start taking the medicine again and I just don't want it anymore. But by the same token I can't completely shut down; and I have 2 small children who rely on me (my husband will be home 4 days this weekend as well; which is why this is a good time for me to do it) so I need to be somewhat functional. what do you guys recommend? I know I""m going to get some multi-vitamins and protein shakes...I was thinking of asking for clonodine and something for anxiety; as well as something for RLS and sleep - when I've cut my meds out before the RLS and the interrupted sleep been the worst part of it for me. does anyone have anything else to recommend? my GP is very helpful and I think she'll give me whatever I feel like I need because I mean it's pretty much every doctor's dream to get their patient off of 24/7 pain meds right? anyway..I'm terrified. I really am. I've lived with pain meds for 5 years because my pain level is so high; and while I've stopped taking them before for weeks or months at a time...this time I'm really done. i want to be done. I know my pain is going to be back; but I don't know that it's not better than dealing with pain medicine 24/7 and all the appointments and side effects that come with it. please help me..I'm so scared. I need to do this NOW before I chicken out and continue the cycle. I already called and canceled my PM appointment for next month where I was supposed to get another refill; and it takes a long time to get an appointment so at this point it's do or die. (not really lol but you know what I mean). help..can I do this?! will the medicine help me?!

918,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 38 yo white male with a family history of heart disease (Dad died of CAD at 42; maternal Grandmother had 1st heart attach at 52). I was diagnosed with CAD in June and had angioplasty & 4 stents (Cordis drug eluding type) for 2 blockages each in my LAD & RCA. I suffered a complication; my artery was perforated during the proceedure and a pericardial effussion started; leading to cardiac tamponade and a near death experience. An emergencey Pericardiocentisis followed along with days in the ICU with a drain in my chest; then several months of steroids to shrink the effussion. Follow up echoes show the effussion to be gome and no damage to my heart. I am now on Lipitor80 & Zetia10; and my ldl is down from 160 to 72. I'm also on Plavix; Enalapril; asprin and Atenolol (25mg x2). I have Gerd to add to all this. I constantly feel chest; gastric pains & palpitaions and these lead to what I believe are panic attacks. I have had 2 thallium stress tests at 2 different facilities in the last 6 weeks; both of which were negetive. My cardiologist assures my that I am fine; I do not have a new blockage or restenosis. He believes that I am suffering from anxiety problems; which I am now forced to agree with. I believe that I am sufferuring from a panic disorder (cardiac neurosis?); I take my pulse and check my BP constantly and I panic at every discomfort I feel in my chest. It is becomming a problem for me. Do you come across this sort of thing very often? What treatments or therapies do you recommend for your patients who suffer from similiar problem?,2004,2004,37.0,Male,,,hello I 38 yo white male famili histori heart diseas dad die cad 42 matern grandmoth 1st heart attach 52 I diagnos cad june angioplasti 4 stent cordi drug elud type 2 blockag lad rca I suffer complic arteri perfor proceedur pericardi effuss start lead cardiac tamponad near death experi An emergencey pericardiocentisi follow along day icu drain chest sever month steroid shrink effuss follow echo show effuss gome damag heart I lipitor80 zetia10 ldl 160 72 Im also plavix enalapril asprin atenolol 25mg x2 I gerd add I constantli feel chest gastric pain palpitaion lead I believ panic attack I 2 thallium stress test 2 differ facil last 6 week neget My cardiologist assur I fine I new blockag restenosi He believ I suffer anxieti problem I forc agre I believ I sufferur panic disord cardiac neurosi I take puls check BP constantli I panic everi discomfort I feel chest It becom problem Do come across sort thing often what treatment therapi recommend patient suffer similiar problem
919,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted by V. Talley on August 03; 1999 at 13:09:49 I am a 19 year old female and have just recently started having problems with my blood pressure. I was taked to the emergency room a few days ago- my blood pressure was 175/120 - I was given several medicines and it took several hours for any of them to be effective. The ER Doctor put me on 60mg procardia once a day. I put a call in to my regular physician but she was out of town and one of the other doctors that works with her wanted to see me right away. He was a young doctor and seemed somewhat unsure of himself. He offered no reasons why I might be having this trouble nor did he tell me any ways that this could be regulated- ie diet. He simply changed my medicine to atenolol and had me go for a chest x-ray. The medicine seems to be making me feel drained and like I have no energy and my blood pressure is still high.

Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - CRC on August 03; 1999 at 13:55:10 It is somewhat unusual for a 19 year old to have high blood pressure but it is possible. I would ask your doctor to look for secondary causes of high blood pressure. It is possible your medication could be making you feel tired. This will also need to be addressed by your physician. Here is some general information about high blood pressure. High blood pressure; or hypertension (HTN) ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. High blood pressure may be primary (essential) or secondary. If the hypertension is secondary there may be a treatable cause. Most of these causes are relatively rare (i.e. renal artery stenosis; pheochromocytoma). If no secondary cause is found then the high blood pressure is said to be primary. The vast majority of cases of HTN are primary. The main cause of primary HTN is genetic. Q: I am hoping to get pregnant in the future and I am wondering if this will effect things? A: Blood pressure may be elevate during pregnancy and if you have a predisposition to high blood pressure it should be closely monitored during pregnancy. Q: I believe the higher blood pressure is directly related to anxiety which may be OK for the ""normal"" person; however with me having this disorder I deal with anxiety A LOT and I often endure it without my medication. A: It is important to take the medication you need for anxiety. In addition you may need blood pressure medication if your high blood pressure continues. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure.

920,Atenolol+hypertension,am a 14 year old girl and was diagnosed yesterday with left ventricular hypertrophy caused by my hypertension. The cause for my hypertension is unknown. I don't exercise but Im fit and normal weight. I keep a low-slt diet. I am not being treated with atenolol 25 mg twice a day. So my question is that how quickly does the ventricualr hypertrophy usually progress? When I saw my cardiologist iN january i did not have it and in a 6-month period it developed. I also have mitral valve regurgitation and diagnosed with arrhythmias.,2009,2009,,,,,14 year old girl diagnos yesterday left ventricular hypertrophi caus hypertens the caus hypertens unknown I dont exercis Im fit normal weight I keep lowslt diet I treat atenolol 25 mg twice day So question quickli ventricualr hypertrophi usual progress when I saw cardiologist iN januari 6month period develop I also mitral valv regurgit diagnos arrhythmia
921,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 53;don't smoke; never drank;no drugs;no coffee. Had palpitations since 13 years old but rarely. Sometimes on a daily basis and other times with days or weeks of no skips. About two weeks ago the palpitations started coming in a regular manner at about 3-5 per hour pretty much every hour of the day. This of course was frightening and I worried and became more aware of every skip. By the third day the skips were at every minute with a few doubles/triples ( each with only a few regular beats between them. I was in terror so I went to the local ER. They took Xrays;blood work;EKG's a 24hr holter monitor. The ER doc saidthe PACs were frequent with an occassional PVC but they were probably benign. He suggested I see a Cardiologist as my blood pressure was quite high at 180/100. I have always had white coat hypertension and at home with the nurse neighbor taking it was 145/90.The Cardiologist reviewed all the tests including more blood work; echocardiogram; his conclusion was even though I was having lots of skips ; the condition was benign and my blood pressure was more of a concern. He recommended Atenolol 50mg and said it should resolve lessen the palps. Fearing the potential side effects I took half dose first as within 4 hours my bp was at 110/75 with a scary pulse rate of 52-56. My resting rate is usually 62 The pressure and low pulse rate continued all day. I started a advanced excercise diet program about 8 weeks before these palps started and lost 25 lbs. Lots of cardio and weights. The blood work showed slight elevation in magnesium.Scared to death.,2002,2002,,,,,Im 53dont smoke never drankno drugsno coffe had palpit sinc 13 year old rare sometim daili basi time day week skip about two week ago palpit start come regular manner 35 per hour pretti much everi hour day thi cours frighten I worri becam awar everi skip By third day skip everi minut doublestripl regular beat I terror I went local ER they took xraysblood workekg 24hr holter monitor the ER doc saidth pac frequent occassion pvc probabl benign He suggest I see cardiologist blood pressur quit high 180100 I alway white coat hypertens home nurs neighbor take 14590the cardiologist review test includ blood work echocardiogram conclus even though I lot skip condit benign blood pressur concern He recommend atenolol 50mg said resolv lessen palp fear potenti side effect I took half dose first within 4 hour bp 11075 scari puls rate 5256 My rest rate usual 62 the pressur low puls rate continu day I start advanc excercis diet program 8 week palp start lost 25 lb lot cardio weight the blood work show slight elev magnesiumscar death

I was taked to the emergency room a few days ago- my blood pressure was 175/120 - I was given several medicines and it took several hours for any of them to be effective. The ER Doctor put me on 60mg procardia once a day. I put a call in to my regular physician but she was out of town and one of the other doctors that works with her wanted to see me right away. He was a young doctor and seemed somewhat unsure of himself. He offered no reasons why I might be having this trouble nor did he tell me any ways that this could be regulated- ie diet. He simply changed my medicine to atenolol and had me go for a chest x-ray. The medicine seems to be making me feel drained and like I have no energy and my blood pressure is still high.

925,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been dealing with the darn PVCs on a daily basis for 8 months now. It seems like they are becoming more frequent. I'm taking potassium and angstrom mg for 2-3 weeks with no improvement. Every time I have an active or stressful day I am punished at night with a string of PVCs that can last for hours. They appear to be adrenaline related. It has made my life miserable. My EP gave me a special script for an EKG for when I got a bad episode; so last night I went to the ER and they hooked me up. They saw PVCs coming every few seconds; and the technician said they all looked identical; so it appears that they are unifocal. I'm not sure what to do here. I don't have PVCs ALL day; but I do get them EVERY day. Some days are manageable; other days are very frustating. I am living right now for the moments when I am PVC free. Not a good way to live your life. So my question to all you fellow sufferers is; is the ablation worth the possible risks? And what are they? Thanks for your responses.,2011,2011,41.0,Male,,,ive deal darn pvc daili basi 8 month It seem like becom frequent Im take potassium angstrom mg 23 week improv everi time I activ stress day I punish night string pvc last hour they appear adrenalin relat It made life miser My EP gave special script ekg I got bad episod last night I went ER hook they saw pvc come everi second technician said look ident appear unifoc Im sure I dont pvc all day I get everi day some day manag day frustat I live right moment I pvc free not good way live life So question fellow suffer ablat worth possibl risk and thank respons
926,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with SVT 3yrs ago; and decided against the ablation; took Toprol xl for a time but currently take no meds for it. It is much better than when I was first diagnosed though I still have attacks. I am taking fertility treatments and told the re about the svt. He agreed to treat me; but I am wondering if any of you with svt had any trouble with your attacks becoming more frequent or severe during pregnancy? I am concerned that if I become pregnant it will suddenly worsen. Also; do any of you with svt experience neck problems during an attack? When my hr approaches 200 during one; my neck tightens up on both sides and I can feel the pulse much more prominently than in my chest. It actually feels as if something could burst but I know it wouldn't really happen. I've asked my dr if I might have anxiety as well but he says I do not. I'd appreciate any advice or comments; thanks so much! em,2006,2006,,,,,I diagnos svt 3yr ago decid ablat took toprol xl time current take med It much better I first diagnos though I still attack I take fertil treatment told svt He agre treat I wonder svt troubl attack becom frequent sever pregnanc I concern I becom pregnant suddenli worsen also svt experi neck problem attack when hr approach 200 one neck tighten side I feel puls much promin chest It actual feel someth could burst I know wouldnt realli happen ive ask dr I might anxieti well say I Id appreci advic comment thank much em
927,Atenolol+hypertension,10 years ago I was Dx w/hiatal hernia. In Oct had an endoscopy and diagnosed w/extreme gastrits and given Rx of 30mg Prevacid daily. In first week of Feb began to experience extreme discomfort and pressure at the xiphoid process of the sternum and along the entire diaphram (side to side). It kind of feels like something is 'folding' or pushing up under the sternum & ribs. My GP adv me to take 30mg of 2x daily for 12days and then 1x a day. On day 3 of returning to the 1x dosage; I began to exp palpatations/shortness of breath in addition to the extreme sternum pressure. GP put on a holter for the 24 hours. Told GP about the experience on the Prevacid and questioned if the 30mg was too much and she decreased my Rx to 15mg per day. I had not taken any Prevacid for over 48 hours and was beginning to feel better palpatation wise; however the reflux acid was up and pressure the same; so after having the new Rx filled took one 15mg of Prevacid. Within 45 minutes the palpatations were back with a vengance. GP refered me to an Internist who mentioned that only one episode was noted on the Holter of a heart rate incrase to 145bpm. I talked to her about the Prevacid and she advised me to quit taking it and manage the reflux w/Pepcid AC or Pepcid Complete over the counter; she advised 1 in AM and 2 in PM. The package insert says not to take more than 2 in 24 hour period. For 6 days followed package and did not take more than 2/24 hrs and slowly noticed a decrease of the palpatations but the sternum pressure has not lessened but was managing acid fairly well (sleep upright). Today there was increase of acid so I followed the Internists directive that I could take 3/24hrs one in AM and two PM... the palpatation/shortness of breath are back along with a feeling of 'distortion of reality'... i.e. like when you have 'medicine head' from taking cold medications. Stopped Pepcid and now on Rolaids and Maalox. As I had had the palpatations with two different 'types' of acid reducing drugs; research on the net found that Protonix; Prevacid; Prilosec; Nexium and Pepcid all have the advisment in thier package inserts that 'adverse experiences occurring in < 1% of patients' included Cardiovascular System disruptions -angina; arrhythmia; bradycardia; cerebrovascular accident/cerebral infarction; hypertension/hypotension; migraine; myocardial infarction; palpitations; shock (circulatory failure); syncope; tachycardia; vasodilation. I am scheduled for an Upper GI series as well as an echocardiogram. Is it possible that the medications are the underlying cuase of the palpatations? When I press 'firmly' and downward from the sternum towards my pelvic region; the pressure under the ribs/sternum is releived. Does that sound like the hernia may be worse? Can there be problems with someones diaphram that would cause this type of feeling under the sternum? I have lost 10lbs since this began and there seems to be less pressure pushing upwards.,2002,2003,,,,,10 year ago I Dx whiatal hernia In oct endoscopi diagnos wextrem gastrit given Rx 30mg prevacid daili In first week feb began experi extrem discomfort pressur xiphoid process sternum along entir diaphram side side It kind feel like someth fold push sternum rib My GP adv take 30mg 2x daili 12day 1x day On day 3 return 1x dosag I began exp palpatationsshort breath addit extrem sternum pressur GP put holter 24 hour told GP experi prevacid question 30mg much decreas Rx 15mg per day I taken prevacid 48 hour begin feel better palpat wise howev reflux acid pressur new Rx fill took one 15mg prevacid within 45 minut palpat back venganc GP refer internist mention one episod note holter heart rate incras 145bpm I talk prevacid advis quit take manag reflux wpepcid AC pepcid complet counter advis 1 AM 2 PM the packag insert say take 2 24 hour period for 6 day follow packag take 224 hr slowli notic decreas palpat sternum pressur lessen manag acid fairli well sleep upright today increas acid I follow internist direct I could take 324hr one AM two PM palpatationshort breath back along feel distort realiti ie like medicin head take cold medic stop pepcid rolaid maalox As I palpat two differ type acid reduc drug research net found protonix prevacid prilosec nexium pepcid advis thier packag insert advers experi occur 1 patient includ cardiovascular system disrupt angina arrhythmia bradycardia cerebrovascular accidentcerebr infarct hypertensionhypotens migrain myocardi infarct palpit shock circulatori failur syncop tachycardia vasodil I schedul upper GI seri well echocardiogram Is possibl medic underli cuas palpat when I press firmli downward sternum toward pelvic region pressur ribssternum releiv doe sound like hernia may wors can problem someon diaphram would caus type feel sternum I lost 10lb sinc began seem less pressur push upward

A little past history first; two years ago I was diagnosed with Scleroderma Morphea. A Rheumatologist confirmed that it was not systemic this past January. A year ago I was diagnosed with hypertension 170/100. Prior to that I always had normal bp. Under meds (Lotensin; Atenolol and Tricor) I have low bp 95/60. About 8 weeks ago I was awoken by extreme pain just below the belly button which lasted roughly three hours; and I was tender for the next two days. I have had four episodes of these night pains since. I also have not slept thru the night in these 8 weeks and I am not sure what is waking me up. Since the first episode I have also been having short duration; varying in severity pains along either flank and across the bottom of the abdomen. I notice these pains only during the day; usually three to four times a day.

929,Atenolol+hypertension,Female - 41 years old - good health except suffer from palpitations. I take celexa because I have anxiety issues that my doctor seems to think contribute to my palpitations. I can sometimes go 2 - 3 days without any palpitations and then wammo I get them every 5 minutes every day! You just never know when to expect them. My question is I have been for an EP study because when I had a holter it picked up a short run of v-tach and I insisted that I get an EP study. They study showed up nothing but I continue to get these skips and flutters. Could they have possibly missed something do you think? My other question is that when I am excited; stressed or whatever my heart quite often starts going into these really fast beats and I get quite dizzy. It is really hard to explain; it is not like when you have been running it just all of a sudden starts going fast and I seem to be able to stop it when I take a deep breath and hold it or it just does one really hard bang at the end of the run and goes back to normal. Do you think that sounds like a short run of SVT or do you think that sounds like v-tach? It still scares the daylights out of me thinking that this could be v-tach. My doctor says know big deal even it is because I have a normal heart. Do you agree? These fast beats don't happen a lot. I can go months without the fast beats and then when I am stressed or anxious it seems to happen more. Could it just my heart reacting to adrelin do you think? I know the PVC's feel like a surge sensation and and then a big wammo and the fast beats don't feel like.,2003,2003,,,,,femal 41 year old good health except suffer palpit I take celexa I anxieti issu doctor seem think contribut palpit I sometim go 2 3 day without palpit wammo I get everi 5 minut everi day you never know expect My question I EP studi I holter pick short run vtach I insist I get EP studi they studi show noth I continu get skip flutter could possibl miss someth think My question I excit stress whatev heart quit often start go realli fast beat I get quit dizzi It realli hard explain like run sudden start go fast I seem abl stop I take deep breath hold one realli hard bang end run goe back normal Do think sound like short run svt think sound like vtach It still scare daylight think could vtach My doctor say know big deal even I normal heart Do agre these fast beat dont happen lot I go month without fast beat I stress anxiou seem happen could heart react adrelin think I know pvc feel like surg sensat big wammo fast beat dont feel like
930,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question. Your answers to these questions are helping many people. I have had palpatations since I was 18; I am now 25. I just had a work up with a cardiologist who did an ekg and a echocardiogram. These test all came back normal. He said there was only a small leak or murmur on my mitral valve which I was probably born with. He said that I would just need to take a antibiotic before any major dental work. My family doctor said that everyone has small leaks and there is no such thing as a perfect heart. He then went on to say my EF was 60% which is excellent He couldnt really say what was causing my palpatations. When I went back to my Family doctor afterwards and had him do another holter(I did one back in 2002 and he said it only picked up ectopic beats and they were normal). That was a week ago and he hasnt called me back yet. I did catch alot of the palpatations on the holter. I will probably hear the same thing again benign palpatations. What is your opinion on my work ups. Are these test enough to rest my mind? I also am curious if the atenelol can ever make palpatations worse. I am on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night. I would like to stop taking it. My doctor thinks it is better to be on it to prevent the palpatations. I want to just ignore these palpatations but it is hard! I have normal BP at home always. but I do get spikes at the doctors. I have taken my monitor to the doctor and it is accurate; it just reads a little higher than his actually.,2004,2005,,,,,thank much take time answer question your answer question help mani peopl I palpat sinc I 18 I 25 I work cardiologist ekg echocardiogram these test came back normal He said small leak murmur mitral valv I probabl born He said I would need take antibiot major dental work My famili doctor said everyon small leak thing perfect heart He went say EF 60 excel He couldnt realli say caus palpat when I went back famili doctor afterward anoth holteri one back 2002 said pick ectop beat normal that week ago hasnt call back yet I catch alot palpat holter I probabl hear thing benign palpat what opinion work up are test enough rest mind I also curiou atenelol ever make palpat wors I 25mg morn 25mg night I would like stop take My doctor think better prevent palpat I want ignor palpat hard I normal BP home alway I get spike doctor I taken monitor doctor accur read littl higher actual

933,Atenolol+hypertension,"So every so often (maybe about 1 to 5 times a month) I feel; well; just plain odd. I get these spells where I feel like I'm not here. I look around me; and I feel like nothing is real. I can also be looking right at my hands; feet; or at myself in the mirror and I feel so confused. almost like I don't know who I am. I then feel tense; scared; my heart beat raises; and I feel like I'm going to faint. Now while this is happening; I have been able to control my thoughts; and I even experimented even under the deepest of fear; to state my name; my address; phone number; parents names; brother; girlfriend; all of their information; e-mail addresses; websites; and I pass all of these tests; but I still feel like I'm about to freak out! This all started October of 2003; one day my parents went out on a trip for the day; and I was on fall break from school. I was about 17. I had gotten out of a relationship; which at the time was still beatin me up pretty bad; I was depressed. So later that day I had decided; I was going to smoke weed; by myself; no one around; and just relax; and let life flow; while being high. Well; about an hour after smoking I started to browse around my computer; and noticed I was unable to concentrate on anything; I couldn't read; nor click my mouse on the right target. I then decided that I would just give it up; I was too high to play around; so I leaned back in my chair and started starring at the sealing. While doing this; I kept slowly bringing my head back down from a full upward look; but there was another issue. everytime I would look straight up; and back down; my images would get stuck; and my head would just nod and would never come back down; unless I really forced it to. I then began to get a little scared; and decided ""ok; thats enough!"" I went to get up; and that's when I felt it; FEAR! Fear like I've never known; so powerful I then started to grab my chest; which got real hot; and I started to panic; I then felt like no matter how much air I took in; I wasn't getting any at all; my vision became a tunnel; I some how got out of my chair; and began to run down the hall way; thinking I was going to die; my vision reacting slow; as if it were taking only pictures; and never streaming like normal. I then ran into my guest room; and landed on a couch; where I then felt pain all over my body! burning sensations going up my neck; into my brain; it burned so bad! my vision was finally restoring; but then I saw flashes of light; as if cameras were all around me! my heart rate was like a drum roll; so fast; I thought I was going to die! I was too afraid to call anyone for help; I thought if anyone came to the door it would make it worse; and all I could think about was ""we can't call the police for help; because they will find the weed!"" and that thought alone; the fact that I still had to hide it; pulled me through; but I was seeing images in my brain; and hearing myself scream for help; but only in my head; this all lasted for what felt like forever; but maybe 5 to 10 min. When I started to come back down; I turned on the tv; so I could have something to pay attention too; and I had to fight myself to concentrate; and I was so afraid for anyone to knock on the door; or to pass out; because maybe I would go through it again! I then laid there for about 30 min; and decided to take a cold shower; still shaking with fear; in the shower; I kept feeling fear; non-stop; so I got out about 10 min later; and tried to sleep in my room; but I was too afraid to sleep! but finally I did. I woke up about 6 hours later; still kinda shakin up; my parents had come back from their day out; and I decided to goto a friends house and tell the 3 people there what happened; but they all looked at me like I was insane. And that was that; it was my first (to what I believe) Panic Attack. later that year; and in 2004; I only had mild fears; and nothing to this nature ever returned. So now here we are; in 2007; August; and I still fear that this may happen again one day. But more recent; I just feel the warmth in my face; and fear; my vision sometimes slows down; and I do not feel real; and most of the time; if I splash water on my face; or grab a wet towel; I'm fine. so now I'm thinking a mild case of OCD? Now the thing is; before that torturous day in October; I had NEVER felt like that; EVER! And ever since that day; I've had anxiety. So it seems to me; that my mind is stuck in a loop; and I just need to boot it out! Now for a little background on myself; and family As for myself; I'm about to be 22; I'm about 300 pounds; 5'6 and have hypertension (high blood pressure) I take 50 MG of atenolol twice a day to regulate this; and take no other meds. my mother suffers from depression and anxiety; and my father has some anxiety; but nothing out of the ordinary; and they never have that bad of a spell to my knowledge. I'm a pretty easy going guy; I do have a lot of stress; and am looking forward to getting in shape; taking some martial arts; and eating better; because I fear diabetes as well. I have one older brother; who to my knowledge; doesn't suffer any symptoms; but has a HUGE problem with spending money haha. I have a current relationship that's lasted for 2 years; and life is good aside from the normal stress of everyday life; and retail. So I ask; am I ok? am I normal? Thank you all for you time! and I look forward to a response!",2007,2007,21.0,Male,,,So everi often mayb 1 5 time month I feel well plain odd I get spell I feel like Im I look around I feel like noth real I also look right hand feet mirror I feel confus almost like I dont know I I feel tens scare heart beat rais I feel like Im go faint now happen I abl control thought I even experi even deepest fear state name address phone number parent name brother girlfriend inform email address websit I pass test I still feel like Im freak thi start octob 2003 one day parent went trip day I fall break school I 17 I gotten relationship time still beatin pretti bad I depress So later day I decid I go smoke weed one around relax let life flow high well hour smoke I start brows around comput notic I unabl concentr anyth I couldnt read click mous right target I decid I would give I high play around I lean back chair start star seal while I kept slowli bring head back full upward look anoth issu everytim I would look straight back imag would get stuck head would nod would never come back unless I realli forc I began get littl scare decid ok that enough I went get that I felt fear fear like ive never known power I start grab chest got real hot I start panic I felt like matter much air I took I wasnt get vision becam tunnel I got chair began run hall way think I go die vision react slow take pictur never stream like normal I ran guest room land couch I felt pain bodi burn sensat go neck brain burn bad vision final restor I saw flash light camera around heart rate like drum roll fast I thought I go die I afraid call anyon help I thought anyon came door would make wors I could think cant call polic help find weed thought alon fact I still hide pull I see imag brain hear scream help head last felt like forev mayb 5 10 min when I start come back I turn tv I could someth pay attent I fight concentr I afraid anyon knock door pass mayb I would go I laid 30 min decid take cold shower still shake fear shower I kept feel fear nonstop I got 10 min later tri sleep room I afraid sleep final I I woke 6 hour later still kinda shakin parent come back day I decid goto friend hous tell 3 peopl happen look like I insan and first I believ panic attack later year 2004 I mild fear noth natur ever return So 2007 august I still fear may happen one day but recent I feel warmth face fear vision sometim slow I feel real time I splash water face grab wet towel Im fine Im think mild case ocd now thing tortur day octob I never felt like ever and ever sinc day ive anxieti So seem mind stuck loop I need boot now littl background famili As Im 22 Im 300 pound 56 hypertens high blood pressur I take 50 MG atenolol twice day regul take med mother suffer depress anxieti father anxieti noth ordinari never bad spell knowledg Im pretti easi go guy I lot stress look forward get shape take martial art eat better I fear diabet well I one older brother knowledg doesnt suffer symptom huge problem spend money haha I current relationship that last 2 year life good asid normal stress everyday life retail So I ask I ok I normal thank time I look forward respons
934,Atenolol+hypertension,"I cant drink anymore. I barely start getting drunk and I just hate it because of anxiety. I never used to drink that much but I loved it soo much. Everywhere else I've read people say alcohol helps anxiety temporarily (and worsens it long-term or for the hangover); but I just cant get drunk anymore. I think I have general drug anxiety. Like I cant smoke weed either (yes I know what marijuana does). Anytime my state of mind starts changing (which happens during the day; sober) I start freaking out. It's the derealization kind -- I associate head changes w/ derealization which a couple weeks ago I had really really bad. It sucks I wish I could get drunk again. Maybe I should try getting completely hammered -- the past two times I tried to drink I didn't have very much cause I started freaking out. I actually felt really good though afterwards I don't know why (like right now lol I'm actually pretty happy; slightly hungover; but feel ""in reality"" kind of like the opposite of derealization). I wish I could just stop worrying about things and instead enjoy stuff.",2007,2007,,,,,I cant drink anymor I bare start get drunk I hate anxieti I never use drink much I love soo much everywher els ive read peopl say alcohol help anxieti temporarili worsen longterm hangov I cant get drunk anymor I think I gener drug anxieti like I cant smoke weed either ye I know marijuana anytim state mind start chang happen day sober I start freak it dereal kind I associ head chang w dereal coupl week ago I realli realli bad It suck I wish I could get drunk mayb I tri get complet hammer past two time I tri drink I didnt much caus I start freak I actual felt realli good though afterward I dont know like right lol Im actual pretti happi slightli hungov feel realiti kind like opposit dereal I wish I could stop worri thing instead enjoy stuff
935,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; This is just to give you a brief summary; My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram ; Kerala followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumour in his left thigh which was also removed next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Surgeon could only remove 90% of it as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.)The pathology report for the thigh tumour and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type I think). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumour is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumour is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumours related to the liposaroma I would really appreciate your expert opinion. Will he benefit and withstand the cyber knife therapy.? I shall be grateful for an expert openion on whether cyber knife treatment will be useful for my father in law and will help in prolonging his life without much depreciation in the quality of life. The points for consideration are: 1. whether CK can be effectively used with this size of tumour in abdomen? 2. whether CK should be availed after further debulking surgery 3. what consequences are there if CK is applied to larger size tumour 4. whether CK can be effectively used for lung nodules which apparently has not grown so much 5. whether application of CK can increase his quality of life and /or life span 6. Is there any other palliative method to make his life comfortable If it is not inconvenient to you a reply by 15th Nov 09 will be highly appreciated as we are in the process of showing him to HCG enterprises Bangalore who have CK installed recently. We have taken some advice from Appollo Chennai and HCG Bangalore on the basis of documents. Appollo hospital advises to to debulk first thru surgery and then apply CK while HCG says even 2o cm tumour it fit case for CK treatment ; subject of course to their seeing latest CT scan.

937,Atenolol+hypertension,I was told I had atrial fib back in march because of my irregular heart rate.It is not always in a irregular rythym though.So Im wondering if I actually have it.My problem actually is though my heart races incredibly fast.My doctor had yet to figure out that problem.I am now on a events monitor because he wanted to know how fast it was and I could never count the beats.Well it happened and it started racing so I hit the record button and it recorded at 234 beats per min. Im assuming this isnt to dangerous because it has happened alot before.Maybe once a week or once every month.Its very unpredictable.Im not on any meds; only a aspirin daily.Im waiting to go back to the doctors.Dont know what to do? thanks donna,2009,2009,41.0,Female,,,I told I atrial fib back march irregular heart rateit alway irregular rythym thoughso Im wonder I actual itmi problem actual though heart race incred fastmi doctor yet figur problemi event monitor want know fast I could never count beatswel happen start race I hit record button record 234 beat per min Im assum isnt danger happen alot beforemayb week everi monthit unpredictableim med aspirin dailyim wait go back doctorsdont know thank donna

941,Atenolol+hypertension,My names Chris; I'm 22; and a college student. I developed a tachycardia problem after I lost over 75 LBS at age 16. I'm now 22 and I weight 179 and i'm 6 foot 2. I suffer from an unknown tachycardia problem that none of the 6 cardiologists and 1 electrophysiologist can figure out. I can't exercise at all which is weird because i was athlete before i lost the weight. I'm now also scared to do any exertion because I can feel my heart in my throat non stop. Even if i dance a little; or do some push ups; my heart is beating so hard and I have to take deep breathes. I have tachycardia with going to the bathroom; the HEAT outside; eating heavy meals; and especially exertion. The problem is debilitating and handicapping my life. I've seen 6 cardiologists like i've said and also an electrophysiologist. I've had multiple thalium stress tests; CT angiogram with dye contrast; hundred echos; hundred EKGS. Tilt table test; event monitors; holter monitors. I've had some tiny episode of svt show up on monitor and atrial flutter once; also had anvrt show up once. My heart is structurally normal; i've also had all the blood work possible and a brain mri and also aortic anuersym check up 3 times. Ultra sounds of all organs so i've done it all basically. My question is ANYONE HAVE ANY INPUT ON WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT? I CAN'T GO OUT WITH FRIEND; NO GYM; NO BEACH; I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF LIVING IS; IF I'M HEALTHY BUT YET FEEL LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD. I'M CONVINCED I HAVE A BLOOD BLOT THEY CAN'T FIND OR A HEART DEFECT. I JUST FEEL LIKE SINCE I FEEL THIS STUFF THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG AND EVERY DAY I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT DROPPING DEAD NOW.

942,Atenolol+hypertension,"After searching the internet and coming up with nothing time and time again about this mix... I am left in a slight dilemma. Firstly;I take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg per day for depression. I find it is working well for me. It does not cause me to be agitated at all. In fact; I feel totally normal on it. It has had the opposite effect on me I find; making me more relaxed or sleepy at times. I take the Wellbutrin XL at 8am everyday. By the time 5pm rolls around; I want to hit the gym. I live in dreary climate.. London; and I find I need something to help me weight train and have energy; get results etc. so I started taking a Bsn product some might consider controversial called No Xplode - ingredients listed below -- a nitric oxide / caffiene supplement. Reason why I am posting here is I really need a solid answer. I moved here from the U.S a few months ago and doctors here are not familiar at all with the drug Wellbutrin to treat depression - they seem to know less than me about it's effects and how it works.. so I can't ask my MD here.. I get my Wellbutrin from my dr. in the U.S - who I don't think would know what no xplode is over the phone.. So I need help from someone who knows.. I have not noticed any negative effects but I just started taking the n.o and i only take 1 scoop - the lowest dose/// I also take cell mass; a creatine supplement.. but I could cut that out if need be. Mainly; I find without the sports supplement I can't weight train properly and get good results - which in turn when I have a good workout and see results; I feel better in general; and happier - however; I am concerned about any long term effects or damage I might cause; with neuro transmitters etc. when combining these substances .. Here are the no xplode specs -- anybody know the deal? or know of a safer; better supplement for weight training / energy; muscularity etc? ""NO-Xplode is a Nitric Oxide boosting; muscle enhancing energy drink mix. The main component of NO-Xplode is its MetaFusion™ blend of ingredients.

943,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 28 year old male who recently wen to the ER for what I felt like was a heart attack. The problem is; I didn't actually go until the day after I had the attack; since I wasn't sure if I was having a panic attack or not and figured I would rest through the night to see if my condition improved. The doctor ran an EKG that came up perfectly normal; and they tested my heart rate and blood pressure; with slightly high blood pressure (138/80) being the only thing found. (I'm aware of my borderline hypertension; but they say its not bad enough to require meds). The doctor diagnosed me with having anxiety (being that I have a stressful work life); and prescribed me with lorazepam. Let me recap the night: I was sitting at home just watching TV with a friend; and we had just finished smoking a bowl of marijuana. I started to get light pains in the left hand side of my chest; upper back; and left shoulder. A few fingers in both hands were getting numb. In discomfort; I kept moving around in my chair trying to see if I just had bad posture. Eventually; I had a feeling right near my heart that felt like my heart stopped pumping for a second; followed by what I felt like was a surge going through my heart; causing my back to arch and for me to take in a deep breath. I also then felt some blurriness in my vision; and a slight soreness around my eye sockets (not the same soreness as I would get from smoking marijuana.) After the attack; I laid on the floor of my home face down to see if I could calm the attack. My dog ran from the other room without me making any noise at all and wouldn't stop trying to nudge himself closer to me. I sat there for about 30 minutes as the pain began to subside. I felt weak. throughout the course of the night; I would have mini ""heart stopping"" episodes that weren't nearly as bad as the first one; and I had a soreness underneath the back of my left shoulder blade and the left side of my chest for the rest of the night; and a couple days to follow; with a weird light fluttering feeling near my heart happening at random times after the attack. A couple days later; I tried to just smoke 3-4 hits of marijuana to see it triggered the attack; and I just felt some slight chest discomfort; nothing more. SO I figured I had just smoked too much the other night; causing an anxiety attack. I've been smoking for 7-8 years almost every day; and I don't see how an anxiety attack could just pop up at random; but the doctor told me that's what happened. The NEXT day; I smoked just 2 hits out of a bowl; trying to lightly smoke. I had another severe attack; with the same symptoms as the first attack. I laid on the floor and clutched at my left shoulder and massaged the left side of my rib cage until the pain subsided. I then went to sleep feeling weak and tired. Lately; I've been doing a lot of research on heart attacks and anxiety attacks; just to see what I may have been experiencing the night I had the attack. There are a few things that bother me about his diagnosis. From what I understand; panic/anxiety attacks can cause a rapid heart beat and frantic thought. My experience was just the opposite. My heart wasn't beating really fast; it felt like there was some sort of blockage to my heart; and that it ""seized"" up momentarily. I wasn't frantically thinking about anything; just trying to take deep breaths and almost meditate while on the floor. Anxiety attacks also seem to cause a pressure in the center of the chest; where mine was mostly concentrated to the left side of my chest. DId I have a mild heart attack; possibly due to some other heart condition that I'm not aware of; triggered by the marijuana smoking? Or is it possible that even with all this information; I just had an unusual anxiety attack? I have an appointment to see a cardiologist in about a week for a stress test; but I want to see if I can get some educated responses about my experience. Please; no ""you should just quit marijuana; it's illegal"" or ""drugs are bad"" talk. I'm looking for educated opinions.

944,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone; Just wondering if it’s possible that my heart focus (cardiophobia) can lead to the very low blood pressure or high blood pressure I have daily? Same for the pulse rate; sometimes it’s so low that I think I will faint and sometimes I entering into superventricular tachycardia who last 2-3 hours in a row with a pulse of 160 and more… I ask this cause last week I had a holter monitor 24 hours to record my heart and the pulse rate cause I have superventricular tachycardia almost everyday since 1 month and strangely; the 24 hours I wear the holter monitor; I was able to do a lot of physical tasks and had NO chest pain at all; had no tachycardia (only in the morning but was around 110 for 1 hour or less) and when I return to the hospital to have the holter monitor remove; as soon as I return in the car; my heart start going crazy again; in the eveniing the chest pain was back; the morning after I had a very fast pulse rate of 160-180 for 3 hours in a row; had the same fast pulse rate at the end of the afternoon after I take a normal bath… Same for the blood pressure… It was high for the whole month; especially the diastolic number ( around 150/95-110); and now it’s seem to be low ( around 110/55-60)… I’m quite worried about all of this and also confuse… Why suddenly my blood pressure return to the low side while I had it higher for the whole february month??? IS it me who monitoring too much my blood pressure and pulse rate or I pay to much attention to it??? When my blood pressure is too high I feel bad and think that I will have a heart attack or a stroke… and when my blood pressure is slow; I feel like I will faint; my pulse rate is higher and I feel bad also… it’s seem that I feel all the time bad cause of my heart… I’m a little bit frustrated cause the holter monitor will give normal results and my Cardiologist will call me and say I have nothing wrong BUT in fact I have a lot of weirds things who happen with my heart since a while… the chest pain; the back pain; numbness of my left arm and hand; headache with pulsating veins on the temple of my head all the time; eyes pain; dizziness; intolerance to physical exercise; emotionnal stress will trigger superventricular tachycardia; things like that… Of course; my family Doc do some test at his clinic when I saw him last week and find out that my blood pressure and pulse rate are weird; he took my pulse rate when I was standing and ask me to do some exercise in his office and take my pulse rate again 1 minute after and my pulse rate who was at 70 before jump to 168 with only minimal physical exercise… same when i’m sit and when I stand; I have a big difference in my pulse rate as well as my blood pressure… it tend to be lower for the blood pressure while i’m standing than when i’m sit… Sometimes I wonder if the Klonopin and the Xanax can lead to those weird symptoms? I’m now so anxious about all of this that I link some foods to the fact that my blood pressure or my pulse rate is high or low… that’s like an obsession… I barely eat now cause I fear to have a bad reaction to food that I eat!!! I also loose 21 pounds in less than 2 months… no wonder why…. For example; everything with calcium increase my blood pressure and reduce my pulse rate… fruits and vegetables tend to make me sick (intestine pain and bloating; chest pain) and decrease my blood pressure; bread; pasta; rice tend to increase my blood pressure BUT can also lower it… I now fear to take my vitamins that I need daily cause of my gastric by-pass surgery I had to loose weight years ago… the Iron pills will increase my blood pressure; the Vitamin D will decrease it; the Calcium pills increase it OR lower it; the Vitamin A tend to increase it… I now give up on the beta-blocker; I try the Acebutolol 3 times and had bad reaction to it… I had some Inderal pills and since one month I was used to take 2.5-5 mg of Inderal when I had the superventricular tachycardia and it was reducing a little bit my pulse rate but was making me a lot anxious cause of the low blood pressure I had with it (low systolic number but ; I don’T know why… and mno difference for the diastolic number); my Family Doc RX another beta-blocker last week; it’s call Atenolol and I try it 2 times and felt very bad on it also; worse than on the Inderal… It’s like my adrenal glands are all ****** up… can’t tolerate low dose of beta-blocker… Anyway… i’m tired of this situation… I now fear to get out of my bed in the morning cause my heart always race… at daytime my pulse rate increase and decrease all the time; who is normal when you have normal pulse rate but on me it’s not normal cause it’s always too high or too low…. ; I can’t fall asleep at night or nap at daytime even if I feel completly exhausted; who is strange cause in december and january I was sleeping more than 8 hours in a row and was doing long nap at daytime without any problem… I now have to take some Remeron at very low dose (3 mg maximum before bedtime to be able to fall asleep… under 3 mg the Remeron don’t affect the adrenaline release… but it’s now begin to be not effective and don’t want to increase the dosage to more than 3 mg cause I don’t want the adrenaline receptor to be touch… What to do with all of this? My Therapist don’t seem to know what to do right now… Thanks for you support!,2010,2011,,,,,Hi everyon just wonder possibl heart focu cardiophobia lead low blood pressur high blood pressur I daili same puls rate sometim low I think I faint sometim I enter superventricular tachycardia last 23 hour row puls 160 I ask caus last week I holter monitor 24 hour record heart puls rate caus I superventricular tachycardia almost everyday sinc 1 month strang 24 hour I wear holter monitor I abl lot physic task NO chest pain tachycardia morn around 110 1 hour less I return hospit holter monitor remov soon I return car heart start go crazi eveni chest pain back morn I fast puls rate 160180 3 hour row fast puls rate end afternoon I take normal bath same blood pressur It high whole month especi diastol number around 15095110 seem low around 1105560 Im quit worri also confus whi suddenli blood pressur return low side I higher whole februari month IS monitor much blood pressur puls rate I pay much attent when blood pressur high I feel bad think I heart attack stroke blood pressur slow I feel like I faint puls rate higher I feel bad also seem I feel time bad caus heart Im littl bit frustrat caus holter monitor give normal result cardiologist call say I noth wrong but fact I lot weird thing happen heart sinc chest pain back pain numb left arm hand headach pulsat vein templ head time eye pain dizzi intoler physic exercis emotionn stress trigger superventricular tachycardia thing like Of cours famili doc test clinic I saw last week find blood pressur puls rate weird took puls rate I stand ask exercis offic take puls rate 1 minut puls rate 70 jump 168 minim physic exercis im sit I stand I big differ puls rate well blood pressur tend lower blood pressur im stand im sit sometim I wonder klonopin xanax lead weird symptom Im anxiou I link food fact blood pressur puls rate high low that like obsess I bare eat caus I fear bad reaction food I eat I also loos 21 pound less 2 month wonder for exampl everyth calcium increas blood pressur reduc puls rate fruit veget tend make sick intestin pain bloat chest pain decreas blood pressur bread pasta rice tend increas blood pressur but also lower I fear take vitamin I need daili caus gastric bypass surgeri I loos weight year ago iron pill increas blood pressur vitamin D decreas calcium pill increas OR lower vitamin A tend increas I give betablock I tri acebutolol 3 time bad reaction I inder pill sinc one month I use take 255 mg inder I superventricular tachycardia reduc littl bit puls rate make lot anxiou caus low blood pressur I low systol number I dont know mno differ diastol number famili doc RX anoth betablock last week call atenolol I tri 2 time felt bad also wors inder it like adren gland cant toler low dose betablock anyway im tire situat I fear get bed morn caus heart alway race daytim puls rate increas decreas time normal normal puls rate normal caus alway high low I cant fall asleep night nap daytim even I feel completli exhaust strang caus decemb januari I sleep 8 hour row long nap daytim without problem I take remeron low dose 3 mg maximum bedtim abl fall asleep 3 mg remeron dont affect adrenalin releas begin effect dont want increas dosag 3 mg caus I dont want adrenalin receptor touch what My therapist dont seem know right thank support
945,Atenolol+hypertension,This discussion is related to Develop rapid heart rate while sleeping. I am sorry that I am glad to hear of other folks with exactly my experience. My doctor suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apenia whereby my oxygen levels are reduced to a level while I'm asleep; that triggers a systemic panic response that results in the racing heart and panic attacks that I've been having at night. I have now completed two sleep studies and have be diagnosed with severe sleep apenia. I also read more on the health effects of sleep apenia and found that it's related to high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; and other cardiac issues. I am starting using my CPAP machine tonight; ironically enough. I'll let you all know how it goes with my heart racing/panic attacks.

About seven years ago I was having the heart palpitions quite bad after I took a prescription drug to try to lose weight. I was sent for an ekg and I wore a holter monitor for a couple of days. Both said that nothing was wrong. The doctor thinks that my heart is ""nervous"" I have had to deal with anxiety spells and depression after the birth of my second child. I am no longer on any antidepressants and I feel that I am not bad enough to take them any longer. For the past couple of weeks I have noticed an increase in the palpitations and skipping. It is now every day and it occurs alot during the day. I was just wondering could it be the pregnancy or is something else going on now.

948,Atenolol+hypertension,"I had my cardiology appt ; consulatation today for first time and now I am more confused than ever. Why is it that dr.s can not agree on tests results; etc? After my apparent heart attack early April; Severe squeezing pain to mid chest; pain to jaw; sweating; nausea; rise in blood pressure; feeling faint; feeling of impending doom; lasted about 15 minutes; went home.not to E.R. ( big mistake.) has stress test May 12; 08 Test was given a Persantine injection ; since I can not use the tread mill; allso radioactive dye to take pictures of heart. The test showed what is called REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT; THE REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT N THE INFEROSEPTAL REGION AND THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOKINESIS OF THE SEPTUM AND INFERIOR SPETUM NEAR CARDIAC APEX. AND MID CARDIAC SEGMENT. THIS AREA DOES NOT PERFUSE NORMALLY ON STRESS IMAGING;. THE SIGNIFICENCE OF A PARADOXICAL PERFUSION DEFECT VARIES BUT THIS CONDITION MAY OCCUR WITH A RECENT MI. PARTICUARY AFTER REVASCULARIZATION OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.CLINICAL CORRELATION IS ADVISED. My dr. accepted this as the result of my chest pain episode in april; all the classic symp. of a MI. The dr. forums here; Clevleand Clinic advised that is sounds as if I did indeed have a MI; though mayby a lilttle one; and that I would possibly need an echocardigram with left heart catherization and hopefully the Myocardium was only stunned and still alive. Now the Cardiologist I saw today didnt neccesary think the same thing; he said there are lots of reasons for Chest pain; but could not specify one; ( I don't have heartburn; indigestion; panic attacks; pleurisy; pneumonia; chest muscle pain or pulled muscle; gallstones or stomache pain; these are the obvious ones. ) I think one thing that threw him off was the fact that my chest pain episodes do not have any particualr pattern; and occur at any time of the day without exercise stressors. I get squeezing tightness in chest; burning pain in my throat; shortness of breath; nausea ; faint feeling; rise in blood pressure and heart rate; and fear. Need to sit down. The nurse even said; ' don't call them Angina."" I don't know what else to call them as I have never had them before this MI ( feeling...) in April. I can not predict when they will occur. The nurse allso considered my blood pressure of 148/84 ( normal and good ) after taking my blood pressure pill????Anyway; the dr. decided to do the Cardiac Catherization to rule out once and for all what I have or don't have going on with my heart. Are all dr. s this hard to get an opinion ; why do dr. s disagree so much? Has anyone else out there had a reverse Perfusion Defect on their Stress test? I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to think. Is it allways so hard to diagnose problems like this? If I would have gone to the E.R. I would not be having this problem now. There is a part of me that wishes I would have an attack in front of a dr. so I can get a diagnosis. It should not be like that.

949,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Kitlyn. I was just wondering if you were still out there and saw my post in response to yours under my page on Dysautonomia?? If you truly want to seek help; post to Ryan (RCA619) on the Anxiety Support Forum. I also have an entire topic discussing the problems and the results from the neurologist/physiologist there. Ryan has helped me to open my eyes to the possibility that I am not suffering from anxiety only; and particularly due to my reaction to the SSRI meds. he recommended that I may have some varient of dysautonomia and to get checked for it. If you haven't already; please check out the topic there; or start your own topic so Ryan (RCA) and I can further assist you. This is not the place for people dealing with panic attacks and dysautonomia. I usually get better support and comfort there too; esp. with Ryan there; who has opened my eyes to a lot of things. ~Crystal,2007,2007,23.0,Female,,,hello kitlyn I wonder still saw post respons page dysautonomia If truli want seek help post ryan rca619 anxieti support forum I also entir topic discuss problem result neurologistphysiologist ryan help open eye possibl I suffer anxieti particularli due reaction ssri med recommend I may varient dysautonomia get check If havent alreadi pleas check topic start topic ryan rca I assist thi place peopl deal panic attack dysautonomia I usual get better support comfort esp ryan open eye lot thing crystal

951,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am an obese 51-year old female who has always had a relatively low BP (90/60 to 100/70) and a fast resting pulse (about 100) and respiration (about 25/min). This was true when I was a teenager and it stayed the same even with aging and a weight gain of about 90 lbs. When I exercised; my pulse always went way up--I was permanently forbidden to come to an aerobics class when I was in my 30's because my pulse had gone up to 220 (the instructor took it herself because she didn't believe me) during the routine exercises. On exertion; it was often about 180; but I got used to it and my doctors never paid any attention since I felt fine. 2 years ago I had an attack of atrial fibrillation that no one could explain. Since everything was fine on the echogram and the exercise test went OK; although they mentioned that they couldn't use the machine's program because my starting rate had been above 100 and it went up to 230 with no problems; they let me quit the meds and I had no trouble until this April. In an extreme emergency situation where I was in charge; I suddenly felt weird; everything greyed out; my head felt like exploding; and I felt like I had a blood pressure cuff on my left arm too tight. My BP (after the crisis) was still 150/110 and since that day; I have had high diastolic BP (about 135/95); ankle swelling; and some exertional dyspnea. Soon after the emergency; I had minor surgery and the anesthetist couldn't control my heart during the procedure. I went into a-fib again; and so I was put on a tiny dose of atenolol (25 mg a day in divided dose) and lanoxin (0.125 mg/day). Even this little bit of atenolol knocked me out--for 5 months I felt sick and exhausted and had horrible nightmares; but my BP and pulse were ""normal"" though I felt like I was going to faint if I even went upstairs because my CO was only about 3.5-4 and wouldn't go up when I needed to run; etc. They took me off it (kept the lanoxin) and I feel fine again; but now the BP is back up and the resting heart rate is about 115. Nothing evil shows up on the EKG; and the echogram only shows some trivial valve changes that the doctor said he couldn't have measured with the machine he had last year; but were probably always there. There is a little diastolic dysfunction; but again he says it is so tiny that it should not be doing anything. He is going nuts about the heart rate; even though I tell him it has been like that all my life. He says I must have inappropriate sinus tachycardia and should be treated for it; but I still wonder if I didn't have some kind of heart episode that day in April and maybe some damage that doesn't show up on the echogram. Is this possible? Can a person have a tiny infarct that zaps the sinus node or something? Is my heart just finally giving in to overweight and inactivity?? I hate to have him fry me unnecessarily and probably to no avail. I know you can't diagnose over the Net; but I'm just wondering what the possibilities are and how to test for them.

952,Atenolol+hypertension,"I thought I'd start a thread to document my withdrawal from Effexor due to the multitudionous threads elsewhere worrying about it. First of all I am a 12 stepping recovering alcoholic (dry since Apr 5th 2011). I am not an evangelist about these things but I know its working for me. I live in the UK I am not very good with the 12 step thing - but I am getting there. Second; I have been on Effexor for several years - max 75mg - currently on 37.5 mg generic - and the manufacturer of the month is ..... TEVA (they vary). I also take 37.mg atenolol (beta blocker) for anxiety / blood pressure. I have been on sertraline in the past ( bad experience for me >10 years ago ) and Prozac (about 10 years ago - good for me) and more recently Effexor. I take ADs for GAD (generalized anxiety). I want to get off the Effexor because I want to try things the 12 step way and because of its perceived dependency. I tried to cold turkey Effexor about 4 years ago and it was disasterous - I went into some kind of rebound depression as the say; got the brain zaps; felt flu-ey; extremely irritable; nauseous and disassociated; brain foggy. Basically very very sh*t. It almost cost me my relationship - along with my alcoholism - and the fact that when I was withdrawing I told my wife I dont know if I loved her any more (we were having financial and consequently relationship problems at the time) has caused lasting damage - which I am hopefully continuing to repair. Even though it was a lot to do ith the withdrawal the damage was done. Here are some of my symptoms which contributed to the above and still trouble me. Lack of sex drive - I feel I ""cant be bothered"" or have no energy - this hurts my wife a lot - she thinks its her. Fuzzy/Foggy brain. Poor quality sleep ( I also have sleep apnoea which is treated with CPAP and is just fine according to my latest check up). Muscular tension/tension headaches Hyperchondriasis Impatience. Lack of focus/concentration. Mood swings. Wake up very early and tired (getting to sleep is quite easy now Ive quit the booze) Also I am fat now - a fat beer bellied ******* with a 45"" belly on a much more slender frame. etc The truth is I dont know which ones are me and which ones are the Efffexor - if any. The truth is the Effxor helped in the beginning; but now I am trying to unmsk my true symptoms and deal with them a different way. Since I stopped drinking a lot of symptoms have eased; but of course dependent alcohlics get withdrawal too. So I have been dealing with the alcohol withdrawal symptoms for 3 months and now after 100 days (On Thursday) and I am moving on to the next thing. So I have several 100 day plans; as I call them. 1) Effexor. 2) Lose my belly 3) Stop smoking 4) Become RULER OF THE WORLD ... erm no .. that should say ""curb my meglomanical tendencies"" - or is that the Effexor ;) Of course AA says ""Easy does it"" - but like I said I am a bit impatient; but will listen to my body. I could go on and on - but I think that is sufficient background for now. Anyway; day one was Sunday 10th July - I took half a tablet (37.5mg/2 = 17.75mg). Yeterday Monday July 11th I took the same - maybe I felt a little odd on the dose reduction - maybe it was psychosomatic . I am going to continue on the 1/2 tablets for a week or two to see if there are any adverse or postive effects. I shall report when I make any changes or feel different otherwise it will be at weekends. I know this Effexor withdrawal stuff is different for a most of us; but if this helps one single person then I shall be a happier pig for it. If anyone wants to ask me stuff then feel free.

953,Atenolol+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong.

954,Atenolol+hypertension,"I wrote once before. I was having a fast heartrate that was waking me up in the middle of the night/early morning hours. It scared me because my father was diagnosed with an arrhythmia and hypertension at 50 (though he was overweight; a smoker; and an alcoholic). I am 26 and in fairly good shape. My blood pressure is normal (or it was a few months ago)- slightly high at the doctor 130-138/70. The Holter was normal with a few extra ""skipped beats"" and a couple PVCs which I don't get very often. Echo was normal. I had an event monitor and everything I recorded was ""fast; but normal- not SVT"". I know that I have anxiety about this now; and I have been having a few panic attacks. But; if I don't ""freak out"" when it is going on this is what happens- I wake up and my heart is beating fast (probably 90bpm) then when I move it jumps up faster for a few seconds- then it pounds for a few seconds- with a noticable sinus arrhythmia; then it settles back to normal; but not as slow as my normal resting rate. My resting heartrate is normally about 53bpm. If I do panic it beats fast for 10 minutes or so. I have noticed that the night before it happens- I feel ""reved up""- but not in a good way. It feels like there is electricity going through the pit of my stomach. I have a theory that it might be sugar related- could this be true? Maybe hormones? I have had migraines all my life.

955,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm 37;excellent health;used to exercise-running 3-4.5 mi./day 3-4X/wk until I had an episode of freq. PVC(3-5/min)after I was 1 mi. into my run one day several wks ago. I've had PVCs since my mid-20s. I've had 4 echos since(stress echo 9/03);holter monitor 3X(last 9/03);and event monitor for 2 wks.

956,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you doctors for participating on this board. I have my annual check-up with my cardio in a few weeks (actually it's been almost two years since I last saw him) and want this appointment to be productive. My first check-up lasted only about 15 minutes and I left feeling kind of disappointed. I would like your advice on what kind of questions and issues I should be bringing up (especially if he doesn't). My story: 55 yr. old male; afib for four years; occurrences start almost always at night in bed; usually terminated via some physical activity like long walks; tennis; etc.; episodes average 12-14 hrs.; twice a week; am taking metoprolol 25 mg. daily in two 12 1/2 pills (I cut up a 50 mg. pill into quarters) late morning and late afternoon; also take a baby aspirin daily; and no coumadin because I'm not 75 yet (because of my frequency and length; do you think coumadin is indicated?). I reduced the dosage because I read where vagal afibbers like myself should not be taking beta-blockers. Your opinion on this? Here's something interesting; I was only averaging a few hours per episode until I tried accupuncture about a year and a half ago and immediately; my episodes shot up to 10 hrs. plus. Maybe a coincidence but any effects from that accupuncture should be gone by now - but the frequency and duration are still here. Am also taking a host of supplements per stuff I've learned about like magnesium; fish oil; taurine; co-enzyme 10; etc. What suggestions do you have as to potential talking points? And how often are echos or stress tests done?

959,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 35 and three weeks ago I began having PVCs while lifting weights. I run too; but I don't suffer from any irregularities when doing that. It seems that the higher the heart rate the lower the occurance. I had a stress echo a week ago and everything was normal and that's when they diagnosed that I am having PVCs. I was wondering these three things. First; what could cause this situation from happening out of the blue? Second; could it go away just as quickly as it came? Last; is there any other tests that you would recommend to make sure that there is no problem with my heart? Thank you.,2003,2004,,,,,I 35 three week ago I began pvc lift weight I run I dont suffer irregular It seem higher heart rate lower occur I stress echo week ago everyth normal that diagnos I pvc I wonder three thing first could caus situat happen blue second could go away quickli came last test would recommend make sure problem heart thank

961,Atenolol+hypertension,"I had a heart attack on Jan 15;... I am a 42 year old male who doesn't smoke; isn't overweight; has normal blood pressure; low cholesterol; (including quite low hdl which is a problem; apparently) and no previous heart problems or any other health problems. I have been exercising for years. My angiogram says that I have ""100% occlusion of the anterior descending artery with collaterals from the left and right. 25% stenosis in mid circumflex 25% stenosis in distal right coronary artery Conclusions: Single vessel coronary artery disease. Grade II left ventricular function with anterolateral apical wall hypokinesis. I have been told to go home for 2 months and that; if I experience angina during routine activities; bypass surgery may be my solution. I have adopted a 10% plant based diet (Ornish; Esselstyn); and am hoping that this along with proper exercise; and rest; will make bypass surgery unnecessary. What I'm hoping is that the collateral circulation will continue to improve enough to restore the previous circulation equal to what my blocked artery could have provided.... Is this naive?.... or should I resign myself to bypass surgery? I only experience chest pain during exercise stress tests...not during routine activities....one lab technician; says that is not unusual considering how recent my heart attack was; and should improve naturally as my heart heals in the next few months....Is this a fair statement? I have also heard that one of the side effects of bypass surgery is a minor amount of brain damage.... this apparently being discussed in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year... thoughts on this? thanks in advance for your response.

962,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My doc thinks I may have developed a collagen vascular disease 2 yrs. ago. I have many symptoms since: raynauds (diagnosed); overall cold intolerance; digestive problems; swallowing discomfort & esophagus spasms; etc. I also have cardiovascular symptoms: For 1+ years have had SOB on exertion (or at night); pounding heart and elevated pulse after exercise or eating; & increasing palpitations. Tests done: 4 echos; event monitor(EM); stress tests; EKG's; PFT's; lung CT-scans; & right-heart cath. due to suspected pulmonary hypertension (results normal). Abnormalities from above tests: 1)EM showed short bursts (5-15 seconds) of sinus tachycardia & SVT's. The palpitations are quick to start & quick to end seemingly with no trigger. 2)The RHC showed a high cardiac output (7.83) & high venous saturations. 3)Two echos showed apical & apical-lateral hypokinesis but later echos showed none. 4)My last PFT's were at 75% diffusion. I started Toprol-XL which has slowed heart & helped some with palp's. & helped with exercise - but more snorting at night. Questions: 1)Is there any significance to having BOTH sinus tach & SVT's? 2)Doc tells me not to worry about the SVT's but some of your information says they can be dangerous - is this true? 3)If my blood vessels are constricted in my body; could my heart be trying to compensate? 4)Since I have 2 kinds of SVT arrythmias -is there increased chances for VT? 5)Two echos at same clinic six months apart showed heart heart size increase but doc says this is due to test error - sound right?; 6)Where do I go from here?

963,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female who is in good health.Since October I have been dealing with palps; they drive me crazy. I have had a holter; echocardiogram and tests came back normal other than pac's; sinus tach.The past couple of weeks have been horrible I will begin my episodes around 4:30 pm and they will last until bedtime. When they hit they will come every 2-3 minutes feels like my heart is jumping out of my chest very distrubing. I saw my doctor on Monday and he drew blood again and ordered an event monitor. I wore it Friday events started at 5pm and I filled the monitor up by 9pm. I will be able to call it in Monday at 9am. I currently take a beta blocker; and also meds for panic attacks.My dad has atrial fib and that always concerns me that I am heading in that direction.I also have very low blood pressure 80/55.I also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis but the endo doc does not feel my numbers are abnormal; so I am not on thyroid medication. Questions??? Do you think it is atrial fib??? My heart rate does speed up a bit when these hit; but not much. Just seems to jump every few minutes or so. Would my low blood pressure cause the palps; I take 25 to 50 mg of atenlol per day. Only take 50 if they really get bad. Is it anxiety or my heart?? With my dad's history I just wonder. This is something new that I have never experienced in my years with panic disorder. What tests do I need but haven't had???? I appreciate your time! Would love to hear from others who are bothered by these darn things.

964,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi there and thanks very much for taking my question. I am a 36-year-old woman. For the best part of the last year I have been suffering constant and frequent skipped heartbeats. It all seemed to start when I decided it was time I started to take regular exercise. Prior to that I used to get a very big PVC only once every two months or so. But now I seem to get around two to four a minute. They are stronger at the end of the day. They are very typical of other people's PVC's: an uncomfortable and annoying feeling of something flipping over in my chest. I don't get breathless or feel pain or anything like that; but sometimes there is a bit of a ""rush"". My father has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I had a scan for HCM about ten years ago and was told I was clear; though a small murmur was detected. I really don't want to give up exercise: I can't believe that it's bad for me... I don't have any particular stress in my life and haven't drunk caffeine for over a year. Also I drink alcohol in extreme moderation. I keep thinking I ought to go and see my physician and get myself checked out; but haven't quite got around to it yet - mostly because everything I read seems to point to asymptomatic PVC's not being dangerous in most cases. Is it worth getting myself checked out? The PVC's are annoying; but I don't want to take any drugs if I can help it. I would rather just live with it. Also; I'm interested in getting a cosmetic surgery procedure done which would necessitate a general anesthetic. Would the PVC's present any problem? Thanks so much Kate",2004,2004,,,,,Hi thank much take question I 36yearold woman for best part last year I suffer constant frequent skip heartbeat It seem start I decid time I start take regular exercis prior I use get big pvc everi two month but I seem get around two four minut they stronger end day they typic peopl pvc uncomfort annoy feel someth flip chest I dont get breathless feel pain anyth like sometim bit rush My father hypertroph cardiomyopathi I scan hcm ten year ago told I clear though small murmur detect I realli dont want give exercis I cant believ bad I dont particular stress life havent drunk caffein year also I drink alcohol extrem moder I keep think I ought go see physician get check havent quit got around yet mostli everyth I read seem point asymptomat pvc danger case Is worth get check the pvc annoy I dont want take drug I help I would rather live also Im interest get cosmet surgeri procedur done would necessit gener anesthet would pvc present problem thank much kate
965,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 31 female; overweight but not extreme; non smoker. I have been living with PVCs since I was a teenager; but had them diagnosed in 99. I stopped with caffinated beverages and that helped tremendously. Well for the past month or so; they have been occuring on a more regular basis. I know; I know that they won't kill me BUT. Friday evening I had taken benadhryl for sinuses (dr told me it was the only medication I could take) and had a horrible reaction. I had a strange hot sensation of blood raging from the tips of my fingers to the tips of my toes. SO we go to the ER. The RN there told me that his wife had PVCs and that I was fine; put me on an EKG and everything was normal once my heart rate calmed down (that happened after he told me I wouldln't die) Major problem here??? I am having strange sensations when I try to go to sleep. Kind of like the pvcs but more of a almost fainting sensation. Has anyone ever felt this? Is this strange? I am planning on seeing a dr asap just to make sure everything is OK (never had the heart monitor on for more than 20 minutes). I am wondering if this is just me in a panic over my heart.. Yes I do have a stressful job/life and I paln on discussing that with the doctor too. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can share.

966,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had numerous bouts recently with atrial Fib And have been in to see my physician. My physical went very well but he did detect a slight murmur and said I have a breathing arythmia. Meaning when I breathe my heart rate slow and speeds up! I have had an appointment with a cardiologist and he listened to me and thought it was a benign sort of thing! I am having a holter monitor put on tomorrow for 24 hrs. and thursday I'll have an echocardiogram done. My symptoms are sometimes a fast heart rate for me 90-100bpm..maybe 110. I experience missed beats or a pause in beats..right as I write this I'm getting 2-3 pauses per minute or so. I get tingling sensations in my arms and upper chest area. The feeling is scary as it happens alot at bedtime feeling a little like tightness or a muscle tightening in my left shoulder in the front. I have been able to put up with these episodes but they really bother me and sleeping is almost impossible.Can sleep deprivation make these worse? I have stopped all caffiene and alcohol...but still continue to have these almost daily..maybe more than once daily. What do you think I should do if all the tests come out negative? Should I proceed with more tests?

967,Atenolol+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me. Could you recommend anything. I am hanging by a thread.

968,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello doc and thanks for taking my question. When I first found this site I was amazed at the number of people who share symptoms very similar to mine with no clear answer. There is a thread in the Family Practice forum with about 25 different people discussing mysterious head pressure. I appeal to you please to help us find an answer; I lost a good job in the airline industry and my friends and family have given up on me; and I've had to switch doctors 3 times due to them trying to psycho-analyze me and basically ridicule me; since my MRI was negative but I still insist there must be an explanation. I have seen a top University neurologist who specialty is headaches; plus another neuro. I woke up with day with an intense pressure deep in my head; extend to top of head and at eyebrows level. waves of anxiety; dizzy; nausea begin at same time. One clue seem to be a ""trickeling"" or ""squishing"" sound when I stretch my neck out or move my head around. If I extend my head upward and hold it stretched (like giraffe neck) and the sound happens I get temporarily great relief from the pressure...I must hold my head in the extended position to maintain relief but when I relax it comes right back. I can 99.9% say this sound is connected to symptoms because there is occasional day when pain/pressure is less and this squishing sound is hardly present. I was wondering first do you think my CSF could be somehow being blocked or slowed between cranium and neck (hence squishing sound) or perhaps poor blood circulation?

970,Atenolol+hypertension,"Thank you for creating this forum. I know it is comforting to many. Heart arrhythmias are terrifying; as anyone who suffers from them knows. In my case; I've had PVC's and a mild case of MVP for years. However; I've NEVER had heart ""palpitations"" like those I've been experiencing in the past few weeks. I'm 47 years old; nearly 48...and peri-menopausal...(not fun!) I discovered that I was anemic a few months ago...blood count 9.8; so I started taking iron. I noticed an increase in PVC's around that time; and was so tired. Anyway; as my blood count went up; the PVC's increased instead of dissipated. Finally; a week and a half ago; they turned into bigimeny; which I have never had before...and which scared me to pieces! I ended up in the ER. Anyway; they did a CT to check for blood clots in my lungs; which was negative. I had had a thyroid check and electrolytes the week before...all normal. Well; my cardiologist seems to feel no sense of urgency in seeing me now. I already had an appt. for May 4 (before the ER incident); and he refused to see me any sooner afterward. I haven't seen him in six years; and the very first thing he wants to do is a stress echo test; without even doing an EKG or a holter monitor...or an exam. I tried to see another doctor; but no one in town will see me without a referral; and certainly not sooner than May 4. I have been very sendentary and exhausted with the anemia; and am afraid to do the stress test. I just want to know what is causing my problem!! Could it be hormonal?

971,Atenolol+hypertension,hi; I'm a 23 year old male in perfect health. i have seen 8 electrophysiologists one being second opinion from cleveland clinic since Nov. 05 and have had; 2 echos; 1 cardiac MRI; 2 stress tests; 3 holter monitors; and blood work; all tests came back normal. the holter monitor was the only tests that picked up PVC's and PAC's. the holters have picked up at the most 300 PVC's 900 PAC's and the least 3 PVC's and 98 PAC's. all this started after dieting and (ephedra free) diet pills. My questions are 1. my fear is that my PVC's will get worse as i get older and i will develop CM; it fears me more because of my age and that i have these now. do you see this happening in my case? 2. my PVC's seem to scare me more when i am aware of my heart especially during exercise or sex (seems to be when they occur more) so i've avoided these activities and that makes me fell bad that i have to avoid those things especially because of my age. besides the discomfort these cause; while i'm doing these activities does it matter if the PVC's come in groups or singles? 3. i'm on sectral (acebutolol) and all my doctors want to see me get off this medication within the next 3 months. is it true that sectral is the only beta blocker with the ability to surpress PVC's; it fears me to get off of them if they are acually supressing them and yet at my age i don't want to rely on a pill? thank you for your time!,2006,2006,,,,,hi Im 23 year old male perfect health seen 8 electrophysiologist one second opinion cleveland clinic sinc nov 05 2 echo 1 cardiac mri 2 stress test 3 holter monitor blood work test came back normal holter monitor test pick pvc pac holter pick 300 pvc 900 pac least 3 pvc 98 pac start diet ephedra free diet pill My question 1 fear pvc get wors get older develop CM fear age see happen case 2 pvc seem scare awar heart especi exercis sex seem occur ive avoid activ make fell bad avoid thing especi age besid discomfort caus im activ matter pvc come group singl 3 im sectral acebutolol doctor want see get medic within next 3 month true sectral beta blocker abil surpress pvc fear get acual supress yet age dont want reli pill thank time

973,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; ""Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis""; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked.

974,Atenolol+hypertension,This started last year. I woke up extremely dizzy; headache and had trouble speaking. Lasted about 4 hours. My eyes were not reacting to light. Months later; while at work I would be sitting and get dizzy out of clear blue. Co-workers often said I was slurring my words; which I was not aware of. Lately I have been waking up dizzy at least 4 times a week; lasting now two weeks. I am nauseated; feel pressure in back of my head; balance is quite off; blurred vision. I have had an MRI; which was normal; A stress EKG; where the EKG was non-conclusive; and the scan showed okay. I have Hasimotos disease; High Blood pressure; extreme Vitamin D defiency; and am taking 50;000ui daily; to have blood checked on June 29th. I currently take Lisinopril 20-25; Atenolol 50; Synthroid ;175; and I have sleep apnea; a Herniated lumbar disk at L3/L4-5. I have involuntary muscle spasms that affect mostly upper body; but sometimes lower extremities as well. I go back to doctor on 29th; and I need to know what to ask for in the way of more testing; because this is beginning to interfere in my daily activities.

975,Atenolol+hypertension,": Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on ""spectral"" and ""verapimil"". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible. I feel mine very strongly and they leave me somewhat short of breath after continuing for longer than about 1 minute (30-40 PVCs in one minute). I have tried most of the ""...lol"" meds (sotalol; pindolol; spectral; atenolol; acebutolol; enderal)and a few combinations of the above without any real relief. Though I have been told to just ""forget them"" I cannot; and they are seriously affecting my quality of life ( I dread getting up from a sitting position and walking because I know I will be ""hit"" with PVCs soon after I start walking). Could write much more; but in interest of brevity; I won't. : My question is: Is anyone doing cutting edge research or treatment on this particular arrythm?

976,Atenolol+hypertension,"I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have ""conventional"" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was ""ischemic."" I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore.

977,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Robin on June 19; 1999 at 12:07:01 I am 34yr. old female and have been diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. I am currently taking 20mg. of monopril(10mg 2 x day); 50mg of atenolol 1 x a day; 20mg. lasix as needed; asprin 325mg. a day; and xanax as needed. My problem and questions are about the monopril. My doseage was increased to 20mg. in march.I had been feeling ok except for about the past month I have been experiencing periods of dizziness; nausia; faint feeling; weakness; extreme fatigue; edema & tiredness. I had most of these before the increse only now they are more prominant. I recently started cardio rehab and on my first visit they wouldnt let me do much because my blood preasure would suddenly drop from abou 117/72 to about 78/60. They were on the phone with my cardiologist most of the time and they said he seemed to think it was no big deal. My preasure came up with activity. I was having one of my moderatly ""bad"" days that day. They advised me to monitor my preasure several times a day and to not exert myself outside of the rehab center. my next two visits I had no problems.The RN suggested that it was my monopril causing all this. QUESTION; 1 If meds are the cause; why do I only have symptoms some of the time? I can go weeks sometimes feeling good. QUESTION 2; do all ACE inhibs. have these affects? QU. 3; will exercise offset the side effects? I am no longer having the monster attacts of irregular heat beat( i still have mild ones) and arrythmias since taking the monopril and I dont want them to come back. But now I have other life altering symptoms. QU. 4; Will I ever feel normal again (havent in four years) or should I just except the fact that I am sick and there isnt much that can be done? I am hopeful rehab will help me feel better. Thank you soooo much for all the info. you supply on this board.

Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as ""non-sustained"". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one.

979,Atenolol+hypertension,"I can't help but notice since I joined this community some months ago; people with skipped beats or palpitations tend to ask questions about PVCs. Like all flips in the chest are PVCs. The upper chambers in the heart are more ""irritable"" than the main chambers. In other words; they are more likely to produce premature beats (PACs). A few examples: Which is more common - A-fib (atrial) or V-fib (ventricular)? Which is more common - SVT (atrial) or VT (V-tach) (ventricular)? Both PACs and PVCs are usually benign; so it's really not an issue; I was just a little curious. Even so-called ""wide complex beats"" on EKG are often PACs. If a PAC occurs very early; it can show as a wide complex on EKG; because the right ventricle is a little slower recovering than the left; leading the electricity to the left ventricle; and then to the right; thus mimic a PVC that origin in the left ventricle. Just so you know :-)",2009,2010,28.0,Male,,,I cant help notic sinc I join commun month ago peopl skip beat palpit tend ask question pvc like flip chest pvc the upper chamber heart irrit main chamber In word like produc prematur beat pac A exampl which common afib atrial vfib ventricular which common svt atrial VT vtach ventricular both pac pvc usual benign realli issu I littl curiou even socal wide complex beat ekg often pac If pac occur earli show wide complex ekg right ventricl littl slower recov left lead electr left ventricl right thu mimic pvc origin left ventricl just know
980,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 29 year old male. I have HCM Cardiomyopathy with a case of Afib. My Afibs are brought on usually on a full stomach. I usually have afib encounters every couple years however they have been becoming closer and closer. I have has the past two episodes back to back this past month. In the span of only a week apart from each other and I have been noticing lately my body almost going into a fib depending on the position i'm laying in or bending over when on a full stomach. The palpitations do become stronger when on a full stomach. I have IBS which was diagnosed after an endoscopy;small Hietal Hernia and Helicobacter pylori. My GI told me that I just have a nervous stomach but DOES NOT believe that the Vagus nerve and what I'm feeling going into a fib to be related to IBS or H pylori? Something doesn't seem right and I feel like my heart these past couple weeks has been very susceptible to a fib.When I followed up with my Cardiologist i went through the routine visit; EKG; ECG; Monitor etc. and everything seems to check out fine. So I believe that something in my stomach is binging on these episodes of Afib. Im not sure if its indigestion. I have heard that GERD can cause triggers to flare up AFIB as it irritates the Vagus nerve. But once again my GI does not believe its that either. I need some opinions because he believes in more natural solutions to problems and it kind of irritates me because I know something is wrong and it's related to my stomach. I followed up with him yesterday evening and he told me to start antibiotics for H pylori infection and later that night after I ate I felt again like I was going to have another episode of afib. Does anyone have the same symptoms? I'm really looking for some answers as I can not go on with life like this. I'm getting married soon and I can not think to start a family with these problems over my head. I need to be a Superman for my kids one day.

981,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; Since a while I have some heart problems (POTS; dysautonomia; irregular heart rate aka tachycardia; low blood pressure OR high blood pressure). They are not well control by meds and my Cardio Doc seem to think it's only anxiety related with a physical deconditionning state and don'T offer a lot of support to me... A new symptom appear last february. I start having a pounding heart rate all the time even at rest. In fact; I feel my heart beat really HARD in my chest all the time; it's especially worse in the morning and late afternoon; after a nap in the afternoon; when I get up in the morning... At bedtime it's seem to calm down a little bit but I can't fall asleep cause of the constant pounding heart in my chest; I ear it and feel it all the time. I also don't sweat like in the past; I sweat mostly from hands and feet only. I feel like my head is hot all the time or seem to be intolerant to hot weater and temperature. Have to apply a cold compress on my head most of the time to reduce the hot sensation... it help at the same time for the chronic headache from the TMJ disorder that I also have. I take some Propranolol 10 mg x 3 a day; my dose was increase from 20mg to 30 mg but since it was increase last january;the only thing it's doing for my pounding heart rate and tachycardia is to lower even more my blood pressure and increasing my resting heart rate... I have severe anxiety not under control for now and the only time my blood pressure increase is when i'm out of the house; in a social situation or have to go to the dentist for example... and normally my distolic blood pressure number increase from 60 to 90 and the systolic increase from 100 to 130... I have a blood pressure machine at home; I take my blood pressure 3 times a day and find out that when my heart is pounding harder usually my blood pressure is in the low range; low for me is around 100/60; I had a normal blood pressure of 135/80 before I start having all those cardiovascular symptoms back in 2010... My pulse rate at rest is around 75 with the 30 mg dose of propranolol; without it it's about 100 at rest. The main problem is when I get up to walk and when I stay in a up position for a long time; my heart rate when I get up in the morning is about 130 sit at rest; when I get up it goes into the 160 and more. I can't exercise at all; will start a special exercise program for peoples who have heart diseases since my Cardio Doc think i'm in a physical deconditionning state... but I fear that attempting the gym to do the physical program will trigger another SVT attack or trigger more panic attack (usually have 1 to 5 panic attacks a day). My question is : I'm the only one here to feel my heart pounding in my chest all the time? I have another holter monitor 24 h test to be done in june; I can't see my Cardio Doc before having that test done. I need some advises about another med than the propranolol to control the tachycardia and reduce the pounding heart rate I feel all the time. Meds that I try so far are mostly all the beta-blocker; propranolol being the one with the less side-effects on me. I also try the Clonidine... Right now i'm on 7 mg of Klonopin a day with no effect on my anxiety at all... I'm also meds sensitive so that's why I can't start an antidepressant med to control my anxiety...

982,Atenolol+hypertension,hello i was diagnosed in 1995 with Graves disease. I drank radioactive iodine and after several attempts i got my thyroid under control with synthroid. Ive had to change my doses due to my test becoming abnormal or high again. I started out at .75 and now Im up to .175 per day. Well the recent test i had done 4 weeks ago said my TSH was 13. So they repeated it last week and now its 16. I am scared. I am confused as to why it keeps going up. I have other health issues like diabetes type 2 (just recently diagnosed borderline etc) no meds just exercise and diet. Im morbidly obese. i am recently diagnosed with hypertension. 168/92 .... I weigh 316. I did weigh 335 but have lost since jan 1st; 2008. I guess the thing that scares me is this all is hitting me at once. I am going to lose weight to get down to my ideal BMI. I know my weight is alot of my problem and these problems would go away with weight loss. But why does my TSH keep going up? What are my risks? Is this dangerously high? Why wont my doctor take time to talk to me. I am so worried. please help me. He is increasing my synthroid to .175 .. 7 days a week instead of 5 days a week with 2 days being only a half a tablet. Its so confusing. :( Im just so upset. All the good doctors i had have retired or quit. I need some advice fast im so depressed and crying.

983,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Doctor; I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hosting this forum; I've posted once before and have found it very informative and helpful; thank you! I have a few questions concerning PVC's & PAC's. I have been evaluted by two different cardiologists with a battery of tests and everthing is normal; noted 1/2 apical ejection (flow) murmur only (28 year old male; 5' 11""; 190LBS; athletic). 1. From what I understand now; PVC's & PAC's are not harmful; is either worse than the other? ie. more PVC's 2. Is the sensation of a skipped beat the result of an extra beat or is the sensation from the extra flow of blood resulting from a longer pause in the heart rythm? 3. If an individual is experiencing for example 1;000 PAC's/PVC's on a daily basis; does that signify an extra 1;000 beats? Wouldn't these extra beats over a span of an average life ""tire"" the heart muscle? 4. I notice in my resting pulse only (around 48-52BPM) that sometimes after relaxing from either a work-out or just normal activity that a few beats are longer apart then others; however this is pattern is repeatitive; meaning the longer pause are not totally random but will repeat after the same number of beats per minute. My question is what's considered and irregular to regular pulse? 5. From your experience with past and present patients; have you seen any individuals experiencing PVC's/PAC's every go away entirely? 6. Are they the cause of some part of SA/NA node's deteriating? 7. Lastly on average; individuals with normal healthy hearts with benign PVC's/PAC's develop other serious conditions?",2001,2002,,,,,hello doctor I want take moment thank host forum ive post found inform help thank I question concern pvc pac I evalut two differ cardiologist batteri test everth normal note 12 apic eject flow murmur 28 year old male 5 11 190lb athlet 1 from I understand pvc pac harm either wors ie pvc 2 Is sensat skip beat result extra beat sensat extra flow blood result longer paus heart rythm 3 If individu experienc exampl 1000 pacspvc daili basi signifi extra 1000 beat wouldnt extra beat span averag life tire heart muscl 4 I notic rest puls around 4852bpm sometim relax either workout normal activ beat longer apart other howev pattern repeatit mean longer paus total random repeat number beat per minut My question what consid irregular regular puls 5 from experi past present patient seen individu experienc pvcspac everi go away entir 6 are caus part sana node deteri 7 lastli averag individu normal healthi heart benign pvcspac develop seriou condit

985,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 40 year old female; generally healthy and have bicuspid aortic valve. My last echo; 2 yrs ago noted stage 1 regurgitation. For the last week; I have had an increase in palpitations. I have them all day long and they are especially bad at night. The exact minute I lay flat they start going crazy. I don't think it's a case of noticing them more because it's quiet; etc. They are really more frequent and stronger. I have to sit up in order to slow them down and still then they keep on coming. I have noticed that I have a lot more heartburn lately. I have been taking Nexium 40 mg twice daily for about 4 years and somedays I still have heartburn. I am being very careful of what I eat. I haven't had caffeine in about 5 years. I don't exercise because these palpitations scare the stuff out of me and I can't make myself go to the gym. I was told to do cardio and only very light weights if I was going to do any weights at all. I had a bad bout of palps around Christmas and went to the ER they ran an EKG and I had LOTS of PAC's and only about 4 PVC's. The palpitations that week kind of settled down to a bearable amount and then last week; that was it. It started all over again. It's like a big vibration and then a thump. I don't know what to do. Is there something new going on? Is there a special test I should get? I don't want to go on a beta blocker because my BP is low and my heartrate during palps is around 64. What do I do next? I am so scared.,2003,2006,,,,,I 40 year old femal gener healthi bicuspid aortic valv My last echo 2 yr ago note stage 1 regurgit for last week I increas palpit I day long especi bad night the exact minut I lay flat start go crazi I dont think case notic quiet etc they realli frequent stronger I sit order slow still keep come I notic I lot heartburn late I take nexium 40 mg twice daili 4 year someday I still heartburn I care I eat I havent caffein 5 year I dont exercis palpit scare stuff I cant make go gym I told cardio light weight I go weight I bad bout palp around christma went ER ran ekg I lot pac 4 pvc the palpit week kind settl bearabl amount last week It start it like big vibrat thump I dont know Is someth new go Is special test I get I dont want go beta blocker BP low heartrat palp around 64 what I next I scare
986,Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping to get some help on this problem I have had for about 3 years. I get a strange feeling in my chest like I could feel each heart beat in my chest and it is very bothersome. My heart is not skiping although I do get that palpatations at times also;but this is more like energy jumping around in my chest. This is an all day thing I get for days at a time. Sometimes it gets alot worse after eating a meal. My heart will feel like it is racing but most times if I take my pulse it is 72BPM but it FEELS much faster. I have been for every heart test(Holter; 30 day monitor; stress test; echo) and the only thing they found was an elongated mitral valve and trace regurgitation which they tell me both are nothing; is this true?? or could that be causing these feelings? Also If I am sitting still watching TV my eyes seem to flicker along with each heart beat. I now this sounds wierd and I am hoping you may have heard of this before but it's like every time my heart beats my eyes pulse. My blood pressure is not high at all so I dont know why that happens. I am 31 female; not overweight; non-smoker. I also have days where I feel out of breath and a rapid pulse just from walking up a flight of stairs and the very next day I feel fine walking up the same stairs. I really need to know whats going on any ideas....thanks so much and have a Happy Thanksgiving Jean :),2001,2002,,,,,I hope get help problem I 3 year I get strang feel chest like I could feel heart beat chest bothersom My heart skipe although I get palpat time alsobut like energi jump around chest thi day thing I get day time sometim get alot wors eat meal My heart feel like race time I take puls 72bpm feel much faster I everi heart testholt 30 day monitor stress test echo thing found elong mitral valv trace regurgit tell noth true could caus feel also If I sit still watch TV eye seem flicker along heart beat I sound wierd I hope may heard like everi time heart beat eye puls My blood pressur high I dont know happen I 31 femal overweight nonsmok I also day I feel breath rapid puls walk flight stair next day I feel fine walk stair I realli need know what go ideasthank much happi thanksgiv jean
987,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello all! Am I ever glad I found this site. I'm a newbie but definately not new to these dang pvc's. I was wondering if anyone else has what I call ""positional pvc's""? By this I mean I can trigger them by lifting my right arm over my head; bending over; turning/twisting when only moving my upper chest; not turning my waist; reaching for things especially when reaching with my right arm over to the left side of my body. (Just seems to be my right arm) Even riding on a bumpy road can set them off which I think is very strange. Also with my last pregnancy; when the doc would have me lay on my back and she'd palpitate my belly it would set them off as well. Other things that trigger them are stretching while holding my breath; working on a burp that is stuck in my throat and talking without taking a breath. So basically anything can set them off! Just wondering if I'm the only weirdo here.

988,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks to a doctor's answer to a previous post about my chest pain; my family dr. has diagnosed me with costochondritis and I am finally starting to feel better; however; in the past few weeks; I have begun to have some PVCs. Can stress cause PVCs to happen? My father died unexpectedly on Dec. 22 and both my brother and I have had episodes of PVCs (I am 31 and he is 29). I also had a baby 5 weeks before my father died; so I have been under some addition stress! We have never had PVCs before. The only reason I know that I'm having them is because my brother is a nurse and told me what they feel like. Both of us have had treadmill stress tests and I have had a Thallium stress test; which all came back normal. How do you cope with PVCs? Is there any deep breathing technique that can help with them? Is just de-stressing enough to make them go away? I usually have 1 every other day; but yesterday; I had 4; and I got a little worried. Thank you!,2001,2001,,,,,thank doctor answer previou post chest pain famili dr diagnos costochondr I final start feel better howev past week I begun pvc can stress caus pvc happen My father die unexpectedli dec 22 brother I episod pvc I 31 29 I also babi 5 week father die I addit stress We never pvc the reason I know Im brother nurs told feel like both us treadmil stress test I thallium stress test came back normal how cope pvc Is deep breath techniqu help Is destress enough make go away I usual 1 everi day yesterday I 4 I got littl worri thank
989,Atenolol+hypertension,Doctor; A few months ago while checking my pulse; I first noticed my heart skipping beats. This now happens regularly throughout the day. I never had this problem before. Are these also referred to as PVC's? What caused this to happen? Will these skipped beats go away? I started taking Zestril for high blood pressure right before these skipped beats started to occur. Did the Zestril do this to me? Could a blockage cause these skipped beats?

990,Atenolol+hypertension,I have horrible pvc's; bigeminy; trigeminy; supra ventricular contractions; and they happen to me everyday nonstop. I was referred to by my cardiologist to an electrophysiologist; and he refused to do the electro test on me. He said it was just stress. But; I still feel that it is stemming from the electrical system in my heart because I get it mainly after I eat; or if I move a certain way such as bending over. He suggested a beta blocker; and the first time I talked with him; he said if I could handle the pvc's then it would be best not to take it. But the 2nd visit; he said that I NEED to take it; because in the long run my heart will weaken because of them. Is this true? Because I bought my prescription of Coreg; and am terrified to take it; and I CAN deal with the pvc's as long as I know it's NOT gonna weaken my heart later.

991,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 35 yr old male in reasonably good health (Chol is little high at 230). I have had palpitations on and off for about 4 yrs; however; recently they have been worse.

Its a very uncomfortable feeling; but eventually I can fall asleep. However; recently; I was getting palpitations so bad (very strong beats); that I was awake all night. I went to my Drs and he put me on 25mg of Antelol. It didn't do much. He also had an EKG;ECHO;blood test; and Holter monitor which all came back normal.

I have been on WW). Well I have gone in SEVERAL times within the last year for heart palpitations and each time the Dr. says I am fine it is normal dont worry about it. But no ekg or anything they suggested see a mental health person to discuss stress. they did do a blood test and all is fine. they also took BP and it is 118/68. My pulse although elevated shortly after the episodes will drop right back down to my normal range 70-80 BPM. Well here is my dillemma. I went to a DR. outside of the Kaiser organization and he did an ekg that was normal and put me on a 24 hour monitor. Durning the 24 hour monitor I had a couple of episodes. during one episode the paramedics were called. Well the paramedics did an ekg and said they saw some premature beats. (the episode was over by then and i was in my ""recovery"" mode) This was something that the dr. did not see the day before when they did the ekg in the office. my ?? are as follows: can the 24 hr. holter indicate wether the ""palpitations"" are life threatening what is a premature beat and is this a point of major concen? One paramedic said that as i took slow deep breaths in my heart rate would go up then as i slowly exhaled it would go down. is this normal?

994,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question: I went in to the ER last week due to PVC's that have been with me for about 40 days now- I get a few hundred per day. I typically get them once every 3-4 months lasting a few days and then dissappear for another 3-6 months. All echo's; holters; stress tests- normal. I am 40; male; non smoker; non drinker; perfect weight. Why all of a sudden do we see a change in them ie: lasting longer than typical? I have been under stress lately ie: move; career etc ... My cardiologist says that they could go on for months or dissappear tommorow for months again. Question: 2- I am not a diabetic but I do notice that when my blood sugar is low I start getting PVC's almost instantly. Is this some coerrelation between PVC's and low blood sugar? Note: mom is type 2 diabetic Finally; I noticed on the blood results my cholesteral readings have come down: Total Chol- 214 down to 155 LDL - 118 down to 80 HDL - 43 same no change Trig - 26 up to 99 Blood sugar- 90 this after having eaten 3 hrs before blood was taken when at emerg.

996,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I am a 23 year old woman who has been having PVC's since I was 16 years old. I was only lucky enough to have them recorded and diagnosed as of last August 2005. I have had a echo; holter monitor; 2 stress tests; blood work and ekg; all results normal except for PVC's. I have elevated cholesterol since it is heridatary on my fathers side but it is just above borderline right now; I am thin and eat very healthy. I have had 4 spurts of unrecorded events that felt like PVC's and tachycardia together (hr at 180+ during the events). This has me concerned. Also I have lately found a coorelation of PVC's with exercise; though I can get them at any time during the day; it just seems to happen with exercise lately. I also tend to have chest pain that can be a sharp pain right in the apex area of the left side of my chest or hard in the centre and feels like it spreads to the right and left sides of my chest. I also get intense upper back pain. My questions are: 1.)should it be a concern to me about the pvc's on exercise so much lately? could a pvc at that rate stop my heart or somthing worse? 2.)What do you think of my chest pain? It can be pretty intense and last 5-10 mins other times it's only for a second. 3.)during the very fast hr spurts (not diagnosed) where it feels like my heart is just going crazy and it feels like pvc's at the same time; is this symptoms typical of those who end up with v-fib?What is happening if it is just ""normal""? 4.)I have seen a cardiologist and I am wondering is it nessacary or important that I see an electrophysiologist?

997,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Again; I am still being plagued by these new sensations and feeling quite fed up with it all!I am getting an unusual palp sensation that feels like it grips me completely;it isn't a usual palp I can ignor;it comes on STRONG and forces me to listen.I had a bad palp yesterday that afterwards felt like someone was choking me and I had alot of pressure in my face.My face was hot and very flushed as too my arms and chest.It then passed.I am fearing I am having a very bad new arrhymia of some kind.I have tested normal on ecg;ekg;holter;bloodwork and stress test. Can I still be having a heart palp that is potientially fatal even after these good tests?Should I fear these new sensations?What should I do next?I went to the ER and had a 10 sec ekg that was good; but I also didn't feel anything unusual when it was on me.What do you infer about my situation?I am at the end of my rope and need some sort of explanation as to why I shouldn't fear dying from this.I am 23;female;normal weight & currently in councilling for my nervousness over this new sensation.I fear multiple pvcs and v-tach;since v-fib is a great rish at that point. HELP! Help me to understand my risks; what this may be(possibly;the chances that it is what I fear and why I should not fear dying from this. Thanks again for your time and I hope you can really give me some insight as to what to do next and what exactly is going on with my heart.I know you suggested anitarrhymics if pvcs effect my QOL. But if I can get past the stress; do I really need a drug like that?Wouldn't a beta-blocker be safer for me?

I'am a 35yr mother of 3 (ages 4 - 3 - 11m) whom after the birth of my last child started down that long tiresome road we all seem to travel. Can i just say this; now that i know what i know about what seems to be going on with my heart and when i think back to THE DOOM DAYS as i call them was not the palpitation as such but the fear of what i thought was going to happen to me. And i think there would be a few of us out there who had there self (dare i say it) dead and buried !! Too many trips to doctors; trips in ambulances; ER departments the lists goes on but always leaving with what seems like no answers. However thankfully for me a chance meeting one night in the ER department with a wonderful doctor who arranged for me to see a great cardiologist that day of which neither fogged me off but instead gave me answers; which after all seems to be the best medicine of all. So in a nut shell i get palps; skips; flutters and my all time favorite svt; I don't know which one they are; pvc or pac or why i sometimes get svt i just know this i need to learn to live with them and not let them BE my life but accept that they are apart of my life; for how long who knows ?? Here are my questions; why do i sometimes get a flushed face and hands when having palp/svt. : finally; what damage can all these episodes do to my heart and am i at risks of having a HEART ATTACK ??,2007,2007,35.0,Female,,,Hi well first would like say big thankyou bottom palpit heart forum iam 35yr mother 3 age 4 3 11m birth last child start long tiresom road seem travel can say know know seem go heart think back the doom day call palpit fear thought go happen and think would us self dare say dead buri too mani trip doctor trip ambul ER depart list goe alway leav seem like answer howev thank chanc meet one night ER depart wonder doctor arrang see great cardiologist day neither fog instead gave answer seem best medicin So nut shell get palp skip flutter time favorit svt I dont know one pvc pac sometim get svt know need learn live let BE life accept apart life long know here question sometim get flush face hand palpsvt final damag episod heart risk heart attack
999,Atenolol+hypertension,Age 36/male. Had panic attacks/skipped beats @ 21; recently returned 6 months ago. Tests: nuclear stress test; echo; several ekg's; xray of chest and two 24hour halter monitors all in past 6 month's; all showed normal. The recent 24hour monitor captured my symptoms. Was told that they were 40 PAC's and 7 single point PVC's. PVC's are the one's I believe that happened during sexual arousal. Two cardiologists said it's harmless. The 24hour monitor recorded 4 PVC's this time during sexual activity. I had a couple of occasions of intense arousal where I had what I believe to be a run of these for a minute or two. I believe the symptoms were the same; just longer and it feels like: Skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; etc. for the whole minute or two. It feels as if it's locked in and will never return; then it does... Could this continue endlessly? I don't feel short of breath or anything. When the run happens; it feels like my heart rate slows; becomes steady and consistent also. Sometimes it will speed up a little afterward,2007,2007,,,,,age 36male had panic attacksskip beat 21 recent return 6 month ago test nuclear stress test echo sever ekg xray chest two 24hour halter monitor past 6 month show normal the recent 24hour monitor captur symptom wa told 40 pac 7 singl point pvc pvc one I believ happen sexual arous two cardiologist said harmless the 24hour monitor record 4 pvc time sexual activ I coupl occas intens arous I I believ run minut two I believ symptom longer feel like skipregbeat skipregbeat skipregbeat etc whole minut two It feel lock never return could continu endlessli I dont feel short breath anyth when run happen feel like heart rate slow becom steadi consist also sometim speed littl afterward
1000,Atenolol+hypertension,I read the article from Science Daily Feb. 08 and the articles on Hepatitis Central; Liver Foundation and Hepatitis Foundation International. They seem real positive about grapefruit. They also list a few drugs which can't be taken with grapefruit. Just came back from my doctor and he said I could have it. He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit! Going to be shot 17 tomorrow and feel good today! UND at 12 week and doc says I have a 60-65% chance of clearing. Thanks to all of you for helping to keep me positive.

1001,Atenolol+hypertension,I came across the Article below on Liver International. Now I have never been a fan of Occult HepC. To me if it did exist there would be signs of it such as relapse during Chemotherapy or when otherwise immune suppressed. This doesn’t seem to occur that often if at all. So Occult HepC was never an issue for me. Might have to re-think that attitude after HCV was found in the kidney yet the patient was PCR neg and no hcv found in a biopsy sample. Classicly cured apart from the detecable HCV in his kidney. A somewhat intriguing article really. I never knew HCV had been detected in the kidneys of HCV+ people. As for being detected in someone who was HCV-; well not sure what to make of that. Other than I might owe DoubleDose an apology. Anyway here is the article Liver International 28 (6) ; 889–891 doi:10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01672.x Renal hepatitis C in the absence of detectable serum or hepatic virus Abstract We report an apparently unique case where hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was identified in renal tissue from a patient with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and treated chronic hepatitis C; despite the absence of detectable virus in the serum or liver (COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). The implications of this finding are discussed; with particular reference to current concepts regarding ‘occult’ hepatitis C infection. Case A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with lower-limb swelling and was found to have stigmata of chronic liver disease and abnormal liver biochemistry. Hepatitis C serology was positive; as was an ‘in-house’ serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (lower limit of detection; 50 IU/ml). Liver biopsy revealed features of established cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. His only known possible risk factor for HCV was a course of dental treatment in southeast Asia 30 years earlier. He was initially treated with two 12-month courses of interferon-α monotherapy with normalisation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and negativity for HCV RNA by the same ‘in-house’ assay. However; he became PCR positive 3 months after cessation of interferon therapy. Three years later he was given a 12-month course of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin with similar results (PCR negativity during treatment with relapse 3 months afterwards) and also started on treatment with atenolol for mild essential hypertension. Given the increasing evidence in support of maintenance interferon therapy; 2 years later he was given a further course of pegylated interferon–ribavirin combination therapy; with withdrawal of ribavirin after 6 months. Pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued over the next 3 years; during which he remained in good health (other than the occasional episode of gout treated with colchicine and allopurinol) and had a normal ALT and undetectable HCV RNA on repeated testing with the previously described assay. Baseline creatinine was normal and there were no documented episodes of renal impairment. He did; however; on one occasion; develop a rash on his lower legs; which was typical of that seen in cryoglobulinaemia. At this time he was found to be positive for serum HCV RNA and on further questioning explained that in the preceding month he had been injecting interferon that he had inadvertently left inside a hot automobile rather than stored in a refrigerator. Two weeks later he presented acutely with a 10-day history of general deterioration; abdominal and leg swelling and then development of a florid blistering erythematous rash over his lower limbs. Pertinent investigative findings included low serum albumin; raised serum creatinine; low C3 and C4 levels; positive urinary dipstick testing for blood; raised urinary protein at 1.5 g/24 h and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M κ band on cryoprecipitate and Ig electrophoresis. Hepatitis C IgG was positive while serum HCV RNA was undetectable on this and subsequent occasions using a COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay (Roche Diagnostics Limited; Burgess Hill; UK; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). A computed tomography scan of the chest; abdomen and pelvis showed features of cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites; but no lymphadenopathy. His remaining liver biochemistry and prothrombin time were normal. A liver biopsy (obtained via the transjugular route) was also negative for HCV RNA by the same PCR assay and histologically showed advanced cirrhosis with minimal interface hepatitis. Skin biopsy was consistent with bacterial cellulitis and this responded to ongoing treatment with intravenous antibiotics; leaving a residual (minimal) rash of purpuric appearance. Renal biopsy confirmed a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). PCR assay of renal tissue was positive for HCV RNA; in contrast to simultaneous serum and cryoprecipitate samples that were negative. The HCV genotype was not determined. In view of the diagnosis of HCV-associated cryoglobulinaemic MPGN; treatment with pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued and his condition slowly improved with normalisation of serum creatinine and albumin. Unfortunately; he was subsequently readmitted to the hospital with an episode of severe septicaemia and multiple organ failure secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; and died despite aggressive therapy including ventilatory and inotropic support.

1002,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi all; Sorry for the long 'history' - this is my first post on this board! : ) Been battling PVCs that I know of since 2007; suspected I've had them prior; but just didn't know what they were. Oh to be that ignorant again!! : ) Dx in 2007 from Cardio & EP was ""benign; frequent PVCs"" and that treatment would be worse than just living with them. So I went on my way; had some off & on; but this winter had a bunch & ended up in ER twice. New cardio did Holter; Stress Echo; Bubble test; 72 hr event monitor. Results were PVCs; PACs and a 4 beat run of NSVT. I have a floppy intraatrial septum; but no PFO & no aneurysm. Her recommendation was to take a low-dose BB (Bystolic); but since everything was structurally normal; to just do follow-ups every few years. Well; the whole thing got me on the anxiety ""must find answers"" treadmill; so had consult w/ original cardio & new EP in that old practice. Basically told me the same thing; no red flags; but EP said we ""should"" treat the PVCs bec. I have ""so many"". I do get a lot and I DO feel them. I mostly get them at rest; when my pulse is LOW; so 2 very short trials on BBs (atenolol & Bystolic) seemed to increase the PVCs which is NOT what I wanted. So EP was all ""you should take Flecanide"" and I said ""go jump off a bridge""! If the PVCs are ""benign"" then WHY do I need treatment? I was having dizzy spells; so we did a TTT; which was ""positive"" for POTS; but EP didn't want to dx me with that until I ruled out other causes; like medication/blood sugar things. ???? I have other symptoms of dysautonomia; so I'm still not sure that's not a component of the whole PVC thing. SO - today had 3rd EP consultation - where he said looking at my EKG; the PVCs seem to originate in the RVOT; which can be amenable to ablation; but sometimes only a 50/50 chance of complete success. He also mentioned Flecanide or Rhythmol - bec. I have a ""healthy heart"" the dangers aren't there that people think. I asked what is the danger of NOT treating it and he said ""there is none; you're basically treating a symptom and when the symptom becomes too much to handle; we'll treat it"". Seriously? I'm not sure who else knows where there PVCs come from - and can you really tell just from an EKG? and is this really NOT life-threatening? He kept saying they were not - they wouldn't cause me to drop dead; which is the reason I'd seek treatment. Yes; they drive me crazy some days; but if it's really & truly NOT dangerous; why would I want to mess around w/ a strong anti-arrhytmic med and/or an ablation? I am exhausted by all of this - worrying about the PVCs; worrying they are missing something; worrying they are ""different today"" & I need to go back to the Drs.; wondering if there is some other underlying cause that can be 'fixed'?? My husband thinks I need a moratorium on even thinking about these things & just go back for annual cardio visits; but I'm so freaked about missing a ""new symptom"" that may change my diagnosis; I can't stop researching. I am seeing a counselor for the anxiety; just in case you were wondering! : ) These things really do make me crazy; but I'm not crazy enough to do the meds or ablation. Yet.

1004,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and paroxymal hypertension in my twenties. I've always felt skipped beats to some degree. About three years ago I had onset of paroxymal atrial fibrillation; this was diagnosed in the emergency room. My heart rate was 153 bpm and irregular. I've had about twelve bouts of this atrial fibrillation since this time. It does seem to be triggered by stress; but no one can figure out the cause. Echos show a mild mitral valve prolapse; that's all. I started having many skipped beats around October last year. I went to the doctor; who put a holter monitor on. It showed approximately 680 skipped beats in the 24 hour period. She diagnosed this as PSVT. I then followed up with my cardiologist who did a thallium stress test; which revealed all was normal. He then put a holter monitor on last week. The computer print out said I had 1;127 narrow beats within the 24 hour period. I believe that; as my diary showed almost constant skipped beats. My cardiologist told me I was imagining them; that I had only truly had 14 skipped beats; and that the computer errored.He feels it's my esophagus causing this. If it was my esophagus; why would I feel skips in my pulse? Does any of this sound dangerous to you? I am currently on tenormin 25mg t.i.d. It doesn't seem to help this PSVT from occuring. The only two things I know is they are worse at period time; and they are worse depending on how I move (bending over can cause them to start) and once they start sometimes they just won't quit for awhile. Is there a cure for all of this? I am also wondering if these ""narrow beats"" which he also referred to as PAC's are to do with the atrium and maybe my heart is trying to convert into a-fib full time rather than paroxymal? Any info you can give me is much appreciated.

1005,Atenolol+hypertension,"I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying ""well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous"" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this.

1006,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a healthy 37 year old woman; who went through surgical menopause two years ago. [Other than many repeated viral illnesses in the past six months] I am at an ideal body weight; I exercise 3-4 times weekly; and I don't smoke. I take Premarin and progesterone daily. This past winter; after suffering a fairly severe flu; I began to experience what has been diagnosed as inappropriate sinus tachycardia for the first time. For the 37 years prior; I never had any cardio issues whatsoever. Then I suddenly began to experience unexplained bouts of rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. At first my symptoms abated when I increased my estrogen replacement; only to return again in a more severe form about two months later. I began to have bouts of rapid heart beat and ""skipped beats"" daily from about 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. -- bothersome enough to prevent me from being able to do anything; with a BP of about 150/95 during these episodes. Advice to just ignore it really wasn't helpful -- I was too short of breath during the episodes to be able to really function. Chance in diet; relaxing; completely avoiding caffeine; alcohol; etc. made no real difference. I have run the gamut of tests; holter monitor; echocardiogram; stress tests; VQ scan; blood work; pheo testing -- all has come back normal. Event monitors captured my rapid beats and premature beats. Now I am taking 25mg of Toprol each day; which seems to really help; although I still feel the side effects a bit -- sleepiness; etc. Two questions: 1. Does anyone have any idea as to what causes this condition to begin in the first place? I'm very frustrated by suggestions that it ""must be stress"" in the absence of an obvious physical cause. I know myself well; and stress is not the answer; nor is caffiene; alcohol; etc. Could a virus have triggered this? If so; is this type of condition generally life long; or time limited? I somehow feel either hormones or a virus must be the underlying culprit. My doctors seem more interested in just treating the symptoms and not getting to the cause; and I haven't been able to find any info on origins of inappropriate sinus tachydardia. 2. My cardiologist advised me to continue to exercise as much as possible. When beta blockers slow the heart rate; does that bar the aerobic benefits of exercise? Thank you so much!

1007,Atenolol+hypertension,I would like to know why it is during activity as simple as walking up the stairs makes pvc's and pac's more noticable? Can you reccomend any books that deal with panic/pvc's.. I have had panic disorder many years...fast heart rate was a common complaint but in all my years I never noticed the skipping til one day I was ehausted and dehydrated.. I am getting better and have learned to ingore them..I still do tend to notice them after excercise. I have just come to the conclusion I have probably had them but neve noticed them before.

1008,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 35 year old; 145 lb. woman with two small children. No known health issues; generally pretty healthy. B/P usually 120/70. Ever since I had my first daughter; I have had episodes of what they tell me are pvc's and pac's. I will be standing making dinner; or sitting with my children and it will feel like this heavy sinking feeling in my chest (almost throat) area. For the most part; it is quick; and if I brace for literally a few seconds; it's over. Since this past August; I have had 5 different episodes where it feels as though it is fluttering and my rythym does not reset immediately; the longest one lasting close to 6 minutes. It is a very strange feeling which starts like the sinking feeling I get from the premature beats but doesn't stop. It is difficult to catch my breath during the episode and it is very frightening. I am not an anxious person; and am generally able to stand and ride it out; but there are times where it feels like it will not reset and it can make me a little nervous. Only once; it made me very dizzy and short of breath; but that lasted less than 30 seconds. I wore an event monitor for 30 days; where they were able to record the PVC; PAC activity. I was also told that I was having a supraventricular tachycardia. I am told by my cardiologist that she is ""very confident"" that it is nothing to worry about. I had an echo/stress test and blood work and was thankfully told my heart is just fine; but these episodes are quite scary. What is a svt and can this really all be nothing to worry about?

1009,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone! I’m female; about 120 lbs; 5.4” tall. I’ve had Syncope and pre-syncope since my early 20’s and I’m 35 yrs old now. I’ve had 4-5 of these/year but this year I’ve already had 4 pre-syncopes and one full blown Syncope. During these episodes I have: Extreme nausea; palpitations; ringing/ buzz like sound in my ears and then no sound at all; feel hot and sweaty and then cold after it passes;etc..I usually know I’m going to faint because of these symptoms but I have also fainted sometimes with no previous warning or presyncope. I’ve also had 2 episodes of very severe palpitations which lasted for 15-20 min just after I had started mild exercise ( Felt as if my heart was in my throat). I have never taken this very seriously until recently because I’ve been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia for pain in my back and arms and I started swimming as recommended by my Rheumatologist but now I’m scared to get into the pool. On a daily basis; I feel extremely fatigued; dizzy; dis-oriented; sometimes short of breath after even slight activity. I have been recording my vitals recently. I have low normal BP of 90-100/60-70; Heart rate while sitting is in 80s and on standing is from upper 90s to sometimes in 120s. My Cardiologist said that I might have Neuro=cardiogenic Syncope but I had a negative tilt-table test result and normal Echo and Stress tests. So; now he is suggesting an implantable loop recorder since my syncope is so infrequent but I got scared and asked for a 30 day event monitor instead. He has also referred me to a EP Cardiologist. Now; I’m having second thoughts and thinking of getting the Implantable loop recorder instead of a 30 day event monitor as I’m really desperate to find out what is wrong with me and just want to have a normal life and not worry constantly about fainting as I live alone. I’m really confused and would highly appreciate any input/suggestions on where to go from here.,2012,2012,,Female,,,Hi everyon Im femal 120 lb 54 tall ive syncop presyncop sinc earli 20 Im 35 yr old ive 45 theseyear year ive alreadi 4 presyncop one full blown syncop dure episod I extrem nausea palpit ring buzz like sound ear sound feel hot sweati cold passesetci usual know Im go faint symptom I also faint sometim previou warn presyncop ive also 2 episod sever palpit last 1520 min I start mild exercis felt heart throat I never taken serious recent ive diagnos fibromyalgia pain back arm I start swim recommend rheumatologist Im scare get pool On daili basi I feel extrem fatigu dizzi disori sometim short breath even slight activ I record vital recent I low normal BP 901006070 heart rate sit 80 stand upper 90 sometim 120 My cardiologist said I might neurocardiogen syncop I neg tilttabl test result normal echo stress test So suggest implant loop record sinc syncop infrequ I got scare ask 30 day event monitor instead He also refer EP cardiologist now Im second thought think get implant loop record instead 30 day event monitor Im realli desper find wrong want normal life worri constantli faint I live alon Im realli confus would highli appreci inputsuggest go
1010,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 26. At the end of February I have started to feel some singular; strong heart beats every day. The feeling was that as if I had forgotten to breathe for a second; then had take one deep breath and then those heart beats were comming with a feeling of anxiety and scare. I have decided to go to a specialist with those symptoms. I got reffered to blood test (morphology); holter ecg 24 monitor; 24 h blood pressure monitor and hearts echocardiography. The blood test was ok - I have got a bit too high level of sodium (146 mmol/l with max of 145 mmol/l). The 24 hour blood pressure monitor showed small hypertension (my average day result was 141/81 when standard should be 135/85; and my averagenight result 129/69 when a norm is 120/70). My echocardiography was ok; it didn't show anything; which could have influence on the hearts rythm; the anatomy was correct. And there it comes to 24 hour holter ecg monitor... It has caught nsVT episode with 11 beats with fastest V-Tach 161 bpm - at 8:25. The whole VENTRICULAR ECTOPY statystics are shown below: All VE: 118 VE Pairs: 0 V-Tach: 1 Longest V-Tach: 11 beats at 20:25 Fastest V-Tach: 161 bpm at 20:25 Slowest V-tach: N/A VE`s per 1000/per hour: 2/6 VE total : 118 V-Pair total : 0 V-Run total (V-Tach) : 1 Longest V-Run (V-Tach) : 11 beats at 20:25 Max HR V-Run (V-Tach): 161 bpm at 20:25 Min HR V-Run (V-Tach): N/A VE's per 1000/per hour : 2/6 Ventricular R on T : N/A And the rest: HEART RATE Min HR : 46 bpm at 8:06 Max HR : 135 bpm at 8:59 Avg HR 24 hours : 87 bpm Min HR hourly : 70 bpm at 4:00 Max HR hourly : 105 bpm at 9:00 Analyzed beat : 116365 SUPRAVENTRICULAR ECTOPY SVE total : 0 SV-Run Total : 0 Longest SV-Run : N/A Max HR SV-Run : N/A SVE's per 1000/ hour : 0/1 Total aberrant beats : 0 Atrial Fib/flutter : 0.0% ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS Total ST Minutes Ch.1 : 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.2: 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.3 : 0 Max delta ST depression : N/A Max delta elevation : N/A Max ST episode : N/A Max HR in ST episode : 0 First; I need to confess; that I am really scared after speaking with my cardiologist; when she had seen the results of my 24 h holter monitor examination - the point of her(and; from now on; mine especially) concern is V-Tach noticed on 20:25. She told me; that it is a very dangerous type of arrhythmia which can cause fainting or even death. I need to tell you that I am true valetudinarian - I tend to analyze the worst possible scenarios when I feel any ailment and to be worried about it. So when I have seen the concern of my cardiologist I don't need to describe you; what influence on me it has... I have been prescribed betaloc 50 mg once a day; and 2 magnesium 500 mg pills twice a day. One important thing: on January and March I have got some serious issues on personal nature which was a really stressful time for me (in fact it is still); this combined with difficult situation in my job made me feel really bad at that time - I have got holter examination then so I suppose that it could have an influence on its results. Now with one more problem - being so worried about my health; I am totally down:/ What concerns me the most... is this episode of V-Tach really so serious? Am I in danger of loosing consciousness in every moment; or even have sudden cardiac death? Is it really something bad with my body; heart; psychology; my mind; so in case of stressful situations I have described; it ends with nsVT like the one caught during holter examination? I am not sure if my cardiologist did well by prescribing me strong heart medicine stright away; and frigtening me with possible serious consequences of my illness (I have been told that I am ill). When I was coming back home after this visit; suddenly I felt very fast hart beating with a feeling like my hart would jumped in into my stomach; I was in panic; for the seconds I was sure it is the end... After couple of minutes everything was back in normal. Now I know it was a panic disorder - first one in my life. I don't think it was accidence that it happen after seeing with my doctor ... I wouldbe grateful for help with analyzing my results and telling me a bit more about nsVT episodes regarding to young people; without earlier heart issues. PS.

1011,Atenolol+hypertension,Patient is 48 year old Cambodian female w/ family hx hypertension and autoimmune disorders (multiple drug/food allergies; IgM nephropathy; asthma). Prior hx: 1) post-traumatic seizure disorder; well controlled on gabapentin1200 mg daily 2) hypothyroidism; euthyroid on 100mcg synthroid daily. Onset was after commencing gabapentin; ? secondary to the drug? 3) hypertension; generally well controlled on irbesartan 300mg daily but exacerbates emotionally stressed Management of the above has been greatly complicated by allergic reactions to: dilantin; phenobarbital; valproic acid; ACE inhibitors; atenolol; thiazide diuretics. Excepting valproic acid; all these reactions occurred 2-4 weeks after exposure with rash; urticaria; photophobia; malaise. s. Reaction to valproic acid occurred almost 2 years after initiating therapy and was of Stevens-Johnson type. 1 year ago for gradual onset on neck and shoulder pain radiating down the arms; and numbness in the hand. MRI showed nerve root compression at C5-7. EMG showed median nerve compression. She was treated with physiotherapy and with NSAIDs but latter had to be stopped after allergic reaction. Carpal tunnel release in June 2004 resolved numbness of hand but stiffness and pain at wrist and fingers con tinued & progressed to generalized polyarthralgias; impairing ADLs. 6 months ago; a rheumatologist dx'd RA based on clinical exam & elevated ESR. Placed on ASA and hydrochloroquine with initial e improvement in joint pain but allergic reaction required discontinuation . Switched to methotrexate. Joint pain did not improve and about 3-4 weeks into treatment she had another allergic reaction; this one of Stevens-Johnson type and very severe. Next placed on SSZ;t pain improved allergic reaction (rash/urticaria) required discontinuation. A second rheumatologist/immunologist conducted more comprehensive exam including hand/wrist xrays; ANA; rheumatoid factor; C-reactive protein etc. All tests negative except for ESR which was elevated. Hand/wrist films showed only mild osteoarthritic changes disproportional to the amount of pain and functional impairment. He dx'd serum sickness rather than RA and rx'd prednisolone 30mg/day tapering down to 10mg. Now 3 months later; prednisolone is 10 mg daily and joint pain continues to severely limit ADLs. Severity flunctuates but pain never completely absent. She has had 2 mild allergic reactions to drugs during this period. Every effort is made to avoid new drug exposures but unfortunately her other medical problems sometimes result in hospital or doctor visits where; despite being provided with the history; new drugs and/or drugs she is known to be allergic to (e.g. NSAIDs) are given. Q: How likely that arthralgia due to past drug reactions? If so; what is long term prognosis? Suggestions on management? Could it instead be a adverse effect gabapentin or irbesartan? If so; what to do given allergy to most alternatives,2005,2005,,,,,patient 48 year old cambodian femal w famili hx hypertens autoimmun disord multipl drugfood allergi igm nephropathi asthma prior hx 1 posttraumat seizur disord well control gabapentin1200 mg daili 2 hypothyroid euthyroid 100mcg synthroid daili onset commenc gabapentin secondari drug 3 hypertens gener well control irbesartan 300mg daili exacerb emot stress manag greatli complic allerg reaction dilantin phenobarbit valproic acid ace inhibitor atenolol thiazid diuret except valproic acid reaction occur 24 week exposur rash urticaria photophobia malais reaction valproic acid occur almost 2 year initi therapi stevensjohnson type 1 year ago gradual onset neck shoulder pain radiat arm numb hand mri show nerv root compress c57 emg show median nerv compress she treat physiotherapi nsaid latter stop allerg reaction carpal tunnel releas june 2004 resolv numb hand stiff pain wrist finger con tinu progress gener polyarthralgia impair adl 6 month ago rheumatologist dxd RA base clinic exam elev esr place asa hydrochloroquin initi e improv joint pain allerg reaction requir discontinu switch methotrex joint pain improv 34 week treatment anoth allerg reaction one stevensjohnson type sever next place sszt pain improv allerg reaction rashurticaria requir discontinu A second rheumatologistimmunologist conduct comprehens exam includ handwrist xray ana rheumatoid factor creactiv protein etc all test neg except esr elev handwrist film show mild osteoarthrit chang disproport amount pain function impair He dxd serum sick rather RA rxd prednisolon 30mgday taper 10mg now 3 month later prednisolon 10 mg daili joint pain continu sever limit adl sever flunctuat pain never complet absent she 2 mild allerg reaction drug period everi effort made avoid new drug exposur unfortun medic problem sometim result hospit doctor visit despit provid histori new drug andor drug known allerg eg nsaid given Q how like arthralgia due past drug reaction If long term prognosi suggest manag could instead advers effect gabapentin irbesartan If given allergi altern
1012,Atenolol+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement.

1013,Atenolol+hypertension,I started again to have these feelings of skipped heart beats beginning on 7/23. Sometimes maybe 2 per minute but may go as high as 10 per minute. The come and go during the day which is very frustrating. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Paxil CR for anxiety for about two years now. I haven't had any issues with these skipped beats since 3/03. Then all of a sudden they return. In March I went to see a cardiologist I met during my anxiety issues and he assured me that my heart was in great shape and these skipped beats can re-surface and disappear just like that. In 2000 I developed anxiety symptoms and was treated for them. I had numerous tests at a cardiologist's offce during this time since some of my anxiety symptoms were causing what I thought were heart issues. I had a stress echo in 9/99 and a cardiolite stress test in 6/01. All negative. Twenty-one day event monitor; X-rays and numerous blood tests along with re-visits to a cardiologist since 2000. I am an avid cyclist and tennis player three times a week. I drink coffee in the morning but it is a light caffeine version. Alcohol on the weekends and sometimes during the week with neighbors. I am not overweight and watch what I eat. Giving you all this backgound; why do these skipped hearts beats keep coming and going. They create a very uncomfortable; anxious feeling when they happen and I am quite sure they feed my anxiety. Can I do anything about them. Are they serious? Do you have any advice or should I expect to live with them.,2003,2003,,,,,I start feel skip heart beat begin 723 sometim mayb 2 per minut may go high 10 per minut the come go day frustrat I take 125 mg paxil CR anxieti two year I havent issu skip beat sinc 303 then sudden return In march I went see cardiologist I met anxieti issu assur heart great shape skip beat resurfac disappear like In 2000 I develop anxieti symptom treat I numer test cardiologist offc time sinc anxieti symptom caus I thought heart issu I stress echo 999 cardiolit stress test 601 all neg twentyon day event monitor xray numer blood test along revisit cardiologist sinc 2000 I avid cyclist tenni player three time week I drink coffe morn light caffein version alcohol weekend sometim week neighbor I overweight watch I eat give backgound skip heart beat keep come go they creat uncomfort anxiou feel happen I quit sure feed anxieti can I anyth are seriou Do advic I expect live
1014,Atenolol+hypertension,.....The advance involves two new discoveries. One is that a protein called NS4B is instrumental in binding some of the genetic material; or RNA; and allowing the hepatitis C virus to replicate. The other is that the former anti-itching drug clemizole hydrochloride could hinder that protein; resulting in a tenfold decrease in virus replication with no apparent harm to infected liver-like cells. Because the drug has already been used by people; it is eligible for human testing.....

1015,Atenolol+hypertension,"Thank you for your response to my CURIOUS TACHYCARDIA of Nov.11; 1998. You mentioned in your response additional tests that should be taken. I apologize for not giving that data initially: I was trying to keep the inquiry short and I felt (mistakenly so) that the symptoms were explicit enough to warrant additional comments. Specifically; I have had a 24 hour Holter monitor which showed several bursts of tachycardia during the day. My blood chemistry (several tests) is normal including the potassium levels. Thyroid function is normal. Other tests for the hypertension show no renal artery stenosis and no pheochromocytoma on the kidneys. The echogram shows my carotids are clear. The carotid sinus massage and the Valsalva maneuver are discussed in Harrison's INTERNAL MEDICINE. Reading up on the various forms of tachycardia there seem to be two candidates: sinus tachycardia due to bouts of hypotension or volume depletion and paroxysmal supraventicular tachycardia. The sinus tachycardia seems a poor candidate since it is chracterized in some of the material I have read as having a slow and gradual response to the carotid sinus massage; whereas my own experience was an immediate cessation once the massage was applied. That would leave the PSVT which has a fast response to the massage but seems to have many origins. If this material clarifies the situation; I would deeply appreciate you opinions on the following: 1. Does it seem that this could be one of the tachycardias that can be fatal at times? 2. With this additional data; can you express an opinion as to the most likely form of tachycardia? 3. Since I am under heavy medication; could my condition be due to interaction between several of the drugs? My present doctor is a cardiologist and he seems puzzled by these symptoms. Thank you for your help. George. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear George; Thank you for your question. There are many causes of tachycardia (fast heart beat) and they can be divided roughly into sinus (originating from the sinus node or heart's natural pacemaker) and non-sinus tachycardias. Nonsinus tachycardias are either supraventricular (coming from the upper chambers of the heart) or ventricular (coming from the lower chambers of the heart). Supraventricular tachycardias include: paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; atrial flutter; atrial fibrillation and AV nodal tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardias are more serious in nature and are due to a rapid depolarization of the ventricles. Sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate of greater than 100 beats per minute originating from the sinus node. Sinus tachycardia is classified as either appropriate or inappropriate. There are many causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia such as exercise; anxiety; panic attacks; dehydration; deconditioning; volume loss due to bleeding or other loss of body fluids; hyperthyroidism; electrolyte abnormalities and many other conditions. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia can only be diagnosed when all causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia have been ruled out. It is not clear what causes inappropriate sinus tachycardia but possible etiologies are an increase in the rate at which the sinus node depolarizes and an increased sensitivity to adrenaline. Once the diagnosis has been made by ruling out all of the potential causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia there are several treatment options. If the symptoms are not overly concerning no treatment needs to be done. There is no increase in morbidity or mortality in persons with this condition and they can expect to have a normal life-span. For persons in whom the symptoms are unbearable medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used; usually with good results. In the rare person unable to tolerate medical treatment catheter ablation (burning) of the sinus node with insertion of a pacemaker or surgical removal of the sinus node have been used in the past. Newer techniques are being developed using catheter ablation to modify and not destroy the sinus node thus avoiding the need for a pacemaker. This procedure is still in it's infancy and should only be undertaken at a major medical center after consultation with an electrophysiologist. Below are some journal articles that address this topic in depth. Your local medical library should be able to help you find copies. Review Articles: Krahn AD. Yee R. Klein GJ. Morillo C. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: evaluation and therapy. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology. 6(12):1124-8; 1995 Dec. Abstract Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is an ill-defined clinical syndrome characterized by an increased resting heart rate accompanied by an exaggerated response to exercise or stress. It is not associated with underlying structural heart disease. The mechanism may involve a primary abnormality of the sinus node demonstrating enhanced automaticity or; alternatively; a primary autonomic disturbance with increase sympathetic activity and enhanced sinus node beta-adrenergic sensitivity. The diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is one of exclusion. It is most common in young females; with a disproportionate number employed in the health care field. Autonomic and electrophysiologic testing may be required in selected individuals to clarify the mechanism and rule out sinus node reentry or right atrial tachycardia. Therapy of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is empiric. Pharmacologic approaches include beta blockers or verapamil. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the superior portion of the sinus node shows promise as a useful alternative in patients with refractory symptoms. Sims JM. Miracle V. Sinus tachycardia. Nursing. 26(6):49; 1996 Jun. Articles Concerning Catheter Treatment Options. Lee RJ. Kalman JM. Fitzpatrick AP. Epstein LM. Fisher WG. Olgin JE. Lesh MD. Scheinman MM. Radiofrequency catheter modification of the sinus node for ""inappropriate"" sinus tachycardia. Circulation. 92(10):2919-28; 1995 Nov 15. BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias refractory to medical therapy. However; in symptomatic patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia resistant to drug therapy; catheter ablation of the His' bundle with permanent pacemaker insertion is currently applied. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency modification of the sinus node as alternative therapy for patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with disabling episodes of inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to drug therapy (4.2 +/- 0.3 drug trials) underwent either total sinus node ablation or sinus node modification. The region of the sinus node was identified as the region of earliest atrial activation in sinus rhythm during electrophysiological study. This region was further defined by use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in 9 patients; in whom it was found that an ablation catheter could be guided reliably and maintained on the crista terminalis. Radiofrequency energy was delivered during tachycardia between either a standard 4-mm or custom 10-mm thermistor-imbedded catheter tip and a skin patch. Total sinus node ablation was performed successfully in all 4 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a junctional escape rhythm. Sinus node modification was successfully achieved in all 12 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a 25% reduction in the sinus heart rate. For the group as a whole; exercise stress testing after ablation revealed a gradual chronotropic response; with a significant reduction in maximal heart rate (132.8 +/- 6.5 versus 179.5 +/- 3.6 beats per minute [bpm]; P < .001) without evidence of an exaggerated heart rate response to a light workload (103.0 +/- 4.1 versus 139.5 +/- 3.5 bpm; P < .001). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring revealed a significant decrease in maximal heart rate and mean heart rate after ablation (167.2 +/- 2.6 versus 96.7 +/- 5.0 bpm; P < .001; and 125.6 +/- 5.0 versus 54.1 +/- 5.3 bpm; P < .001; respectively). There was a significant decrease in the number of applications of radiofrequency energy required in patients undergoing modification of the sinus node when guided by ICE compared with fluoroscopy alone (3.6 +/- 0.8 versus 10.4 +/- 2.1; P < .01) as well as a decrease in fluoroscopy time (33.0 +/- 9.5 versus 58.5 +/- 8.4 minutes). After a mean follow-up period of 20.5 +/- 0.3 months; there were no recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent a total sinus node ablation. However; 2 patients who had a total sinus node ablation subsequently required permanent pacing because of symptomatic pauses; and 1 patient developed an ectopic atrial tachycardia. After a mean follow-up of 7.1 +/- 1.7 months; there were two recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent sinus node modification. However; no significant bradycardia or pauses were observed. Complications encountered during the study included 1 patient who developed transient right diaphragmatic paralysis and another patient who developed transient superior vena cava syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus node modification is feasible in humans and should be considered as an alternative to complete atrioventricular junctional ablation for patients with disabling inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to medical management. Sinus node modification may be aided by ICE. Jayaprakash S. Sparks PB. Vohra J. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST): management by radiofrequency modification of sinus node. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Medicine. 27(4):391-7; 1997 Aug. BACKGROUND: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a rare form of supraventricular arrhythmia. It can cause disabling symptoms and may be refractory to medical treatment. In symptomatic drug refractory patients; sinus node excision or total ablation of the sinus node with permanent pacemaker implantation was the only therapeutic option. Recently; radiofrequency (RF) modification of the sinus node has been reported to be an effective treatment for this condition. AIM: To present our experience with sinus node modification using RF energy in the management of IST. METHODS: Between 1989 to 1996 three patients (two females and one male); aged 28-36 years were diagnosed with symptomatic IST. All had failed multiple drugs and hence underwent sinus node modification using RF. In the first two patients; the site of RF application was guided by anatomical landmarks using fluoroscopy to localise the presumed most superior portion of the crista terminalis and also the earliest site of atrial activation. In the third patient; a 20 pole electrode catheter was used to map the crista terminalis and guide the ablation. Success was defined by 20-30% reduction in the heart rate with normal atrial activation sequence after ablation. RESULTS: The three patients described here had IST by clinical; electrocardiographic and electrophysiological criteria and were refractory to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs. The number of RF applications were 11; 15; and three applied at the site of earliest atrial activation for the control of heart rates. Patient 3 had a early recurrence at one month and underwent repeat sinus node modification (five RF applications). All three patients who underwent RF modification of the sinus node had a successful outcome. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patients remain asymptomatic during follow up (20; 12 and three months) with satisfactory control of heart rate; although one patient requires atenolol which was previously ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: RF modification of the sinus node is feasible and effective for IST; and should be the treatment of choice in patients refractory to medical therapy.

1016,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

1018,Atenolol+hypertension,Last night I had a vibration thing happen in my chest off and on for about 2 hours. I am almost positive that my pulse was normal just fast (100-110). It was scary but I didn't panic and my breathing stayed normal. I have had a panic attack before (full on heart attack thinking kind) and this wasn't like that. I was just wondering if the heart can be spasming and yet not be arrythmic. Does that make sense? Is an anxiety attack and a panic attack the same thing? (I did post on the anxiety forum too; I just feel like it is a heart related issue so I thought I'd try it here too!!) I have mentioned that I am heading to Mayo and I would like to go up there with only the relevant chest related issues and although I FEEL like last night was one; I really honestly don't know anymore.

1019,Atenolol+hypertension,"Had a stent placed in L main coronary artery (95% blockage) 2 months ago. Prior to the stent I had been extremely athletic.

1022,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello*** I was wondering if anyone could provide me a little information and possibly some relief to the problem I am experiencing right now. Every night for the past week or so; when I try to fall asleep; my heart rate accelerates tremendously and pounds like crazy. Normally I never have any trouble falling asleep so this is becoming somewhat of an annoyance because I actually FEEL sleepy but because my heart beats so fast and so hard it keeps me awake. I can feel it throughtout my body and it lasts for hours. I try so hard to fall asleep that I have come up with little tricks to kind of ""pych myself out"". Like I try rolling over in different positions trying to offset the rhythm so hopefully when it starts again it will be normal. I try to clear my mind totally. After a while I will doze off; (without me knowing but I'm not complaining) but I'll wake like 45 min later only to realize that my heart is still beating as hard as ever. If I get really annoyed I'll try to stand up; walk around or go for a drink of water. But nothing helps. And I'm so sleepy. As soon as I settle back in it starts again. I have had anxiety issues in the past but I think what made it worse for me is that at first I didn't know what it was. Then once I became more aware of what an actual ""anxiety attack"" was it just kind of went away on its own. And I do admit I was dealing with a whole lot at the time. But now; on the contrary; there has been no extreme changes in my life or anything I would say I am really stressed or worried over; @ night all I pretty much want to do is sleep and I can't. It's coming to the point now that I am almost expecting my ""nightly episodes""; like I'm looking for it to start. And this is an obsession (an unhealthy one at that) that I don't care to have! The way my heart beats it feels like to me that it is pumping way too much blood throughout my body for too long of a time; my heart might burst; or I may die in my sleep. Its poisoning my thoughts and I wish I knew what to do to make it stop. I'm afraid.

1027,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations?

I too have the same thing so it may not be all in your head if your suspect this to be the case. Most dr.'s think your crazy or never heard of this when you even suggest it. Thats whats wrong with most dr's atleast in my experience in that they don't think outside the box enough possibly because this is what they learned. I think I/we can guess or prognose just as well or better than they can at times particularly if we know something about health and or ourselves and our own health. Never be afraid to speak up because I feel strongly that digestive tract problems are real and translate into other real nasty symptoms like this. Fortunately we can prevent much of this & need to prevent it from happening. I do feel the more you get afib the worse it can become either physically; emmotionally or both no matter what the cause. I thought up until now that I may have been the first to discover this but would like to know if anyone else has any real answers to this as being a connection? I would like to know how many people feel that they get atrial fibrillation and feel that it may be related to gas or full; bloated stomach; intestinal or digestive tract troubles etc? Isn't it possible that the gas; bloat; perhaps inflamed digestive or intestinal tract can disturb the vagus nerve thereby possibly causing you to go into an afib attack? Any real dr's out there any more with some real info about this? Even conjecture? Any way I also would be interested in what anyone might have to say about it and or what they may have learned from this? If you know or even think this to be the case for you I would also like to correspond with you to trade stories and info on what you''ve learned and done. Be well.

I first thought my cell phone may have started it since I have had it attached to my belt; on the vibrate status. I stopped doing this and still feel it. It is either a vibration or a sensation of filling up with liquid. No other symptoms are there. No pain in urination; no pain in sex; have been married for many years with one partner; and no urge to go to the bathroom. It happens randomly; and lasts for 3-6 seconds then goes away.

1031,Atenolol+hypertension,"There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the ""spot"" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?",2008,2008,,Male,,,there sever us similar eye complaint see bright flash like afterimag flash bulb blink sometim upgaz thi transient symptom us last anywher day week when spot visual field pass dark background spot appear light when spot pass light background appear dark So far doctor havent abl diagnos us perhap mean simpli idiopath phenomenon but case Im wonder similar might could bring us closer explan for instanc factor might clue I take 100 mg zoloft day I would describ highanxieti stress I clench teeth usual side effect eye I alot sinu problem around eye I doubl vision due weak muscl one eye I mani floater one promin one eye without bright spot how

I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago.

1034,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi. I've been taking Lisinopril 40mg; and crazy dizziness and headaches occurred and brought my blood pressure down to around 90/50; so my doctor had me take only 20mg lisinopril per day. With 20mg; my blood pressure was constantly at 160-170/100. Then; the doctor told me to take Atenolol 25mg at night and lisinopril 20mg in the morning. It brought my blood pressure down to around 100/60 regularly; but recently it started going up again. I often have electric tingling/weakness in my hands/arms/legs and feel like I will faint. Blood pressure fluctuates from 160/100 to 100/60 from one day to another. Doctor thinks I have panic attack and should take Xanax for it. But; I feel like the medication combination (atenolol/lisinopril) is giving me hard time. I asked doctor to please change the medication but he refuses; and he thinks it's the anxiety attack that's the cause for all this. What should I do? Is Lisinopril/Atenolol a proven combination to help hypertension? Thanks.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,,,Hi ive take lisinopril 40mg crazi dizzi headach occur brought blood pressur around 9050 doctor take 20mg lisinopril per day with 20mg blood pressur constantli 160170100 then doctor told take atenolol 25mg night lisinopril 20mg morn It brought blood pressur around 10060 regularli recent start go I often electr tinglingweak handsarmsleg feel like I faint blood pressur fluctuat 160100 10060 one day anoth doctor think I panic attack take xanax but I feel like medic combin atenolollisinopril give hard time I ask doctor pleas chang medic refus think anxieti attack that caus what I Is lisinoprilatenolol proven combin help hypertens thank

1037,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I believe I suffer from white coat hypertension. Earlier (until a year ago); when I didn't care about my blood pressure; I always had excellent results when my doctor measured it (115-120/60-70). After I started worrying about my heart (not so much anymore; I usually try my best to help people on the heart rhythm community) my BP readings are higher. I feel my muscles get tense and my heart starts pounding when the cuff inflates; and blood pressure is 140-155/80-95. At home; I get similar symptoms on the first measuring; but it resolves and gradually slows to 120/70 after some tries. I measured it one weekend after a good night of sleep and it was 105/55. I was completely relaxed; for once; at that time. What is quite strange; is that I imagine this started when I started using propranolol (20 mg) for PACs and sinus tachycardia. After this; my heart didn't race when I got scared; but beat harder instead. When I was really scared; I actually had bradycardia; but I got a strange sensation that my blood vessels were constricted (may be imagination..) I got my beta blocker changed to metoprolol (25 mg) and I feel my anxiety getting a bit stronger. But now my heart races a bit more in response to anxiety. Can propranolol actually contribute to higher blood pressure with stress? Are my assumptions correct that propranolol works better on anxiety due to the non-selective effect? Is my BP really normal? My heart is otherwise fine with normal chambers; wall dimensions and excellent contractility (EF 78%). I have some PACs but I'm otherwise healthy; exercise 3 times/week and normal weight.

1038,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I can't sleep and was up thinking. As I said before; I just started getting the symptoms that everyone is experiencing 6 months ago around the time that I started taking Lisinopril-HCTZ for my high blood pressure. I was told by my primary doctor that Lisinopril-HCTZ was a water pill and that it was safe and a low dosage. After going to the emergency several times for a tickle on one side and sometime on both sides of my throat; coughing; watery eyes; and running nose; the emergency doctor asked me if I ever had COPD. I explained to him that I had never had any illnesses except High Blood Pressure; which was diagnosed around 6 months ago. The Emergency doctor kept questioning me about the time I starting Lisinopril-HCTZ and the time my symptoms started. He told my to stop taking Lisinopril-HCTZ and to call the hospitial today for a physcian. He also said that one of the side effect of Lisinopril-HCTZ is a dry cough. Once I arrived home I decided to took up the side effects of Lisinopril and found that it is not a water pill after all. I am wondering if Lisinopril-HCTZ can some how be contributed to my symptoms.,2009,2009,,,,,Hi I cant sleep think As I said I start get symptom everyon experienc 6 month ago around time I start take lisinoprilhctz high blood pressur I told primari doctor lisinoprilhctz water pill safe low dosag after go emerg sever time tickl one side sometim side throat cough wateri eye run nose emerg doctor ask I ever copd I explain I never ill except high blood pressur diagnos around 6 month ago the emerg doctor kept question time I start lisinoprilhctz time symptom start He told stop take lisinoprilhctz call hospiti today physcian He also said one side effect lisinoprilhctz dri cough onc I arriv home I decid took side effect lisinopril found water pill I wonder lisinoprilhctz contribut symptom
1039,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril. About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG; X-rays; MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and gave me one dose of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist. Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg); Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment.

1040,Lisinopril+hypertension,The patient (50 years old) had a very high systolic pressure ranging 180-210 mmHg. Used Lisinopril for 4 days in this way: 20 mg in 7 am ; and 20 mg Lisinopril in 7 pm (so total = 40 mg Lisinopril per day). During the day (systolic) hypertension goes 150-160 mmHg and only in 2-4pm it is 130 mmHg (and at 10-12 pm). What should be done for this patient. Maybe trying a diuretic (hydrochlorthiazid) and lowering the dose of Lisinopril? Please tell what do you think of the doses to start trying; how often and when during the day? (P.S. if you think of another drug/combination may be more effective trying; it would be a great help).,2011,2011,,,,,the patient 50 year old high systol pressur rang 180210 mmhg use lisinopril 4 day way 20 mg 7 20 mg lisinopril 7 pm total 40 mg lisinopril per day dure day systol hypertens goe 150160 mmhg 24pm 130 mmhg 1012 pm what done patient mayb tri diuret hydrochlorthiazid lower dose lisinopril pleas tell think dose start tri often day PS think anoth drugcombin may effect tri would great help
1041,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; thank you for taking the time to answer this question. I have been diagnosed with Mitral Valve Leakage. I do not know the specific RF numbers associated with this. I read via the net that in time either mitral valve repair or replacement may be needed. The Cardiologist I am seeing has placed me on 5mg of Lisinoril. I am wondering if this is a theorpy for deplaying surgery or is it a long term plan to treat the leakage. I am also on 25mg Metoprolol twice daily. I will be having a heart cath in 2 weeks to investigate the valve further and to rule out any other damage. Please advise of the results of other Lisinopril treatment history.

1044,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi everyone; I was recently in the ER because I felt a consistent fluttering in my chest which later turned out to be PVCs. The ER kept me in; monitored me for 18 hours; and I seem to have averaged around 3-7 PVCs per minute for all of my waking hours there. This was a totally new experience for me. In the past I had felt this flutter maybe 3 or 4 times a year for about 15-30 seconds total and therefore didn't know what it was. I am in my early 50s. The tests showed no signs of MI; thryoid appeared good; and the echocardiogram was perfectly normal. So I was sent home and basically told not to worry about it. Now; I did mention the docs that about 5 days prior to this event; my GP had doubled my lisinopril from 20 mg. to 40 mg; once a day. I also take 200 mg Toprol. I am not taking a diuretic because the darn stuff was making me 'go' 15 times a day. So the Toprol and then Lisinopril was used for my hypertension. At the moment my hypertension is not as well controlled as I'd like with these two meds. I am quite overweight and struggling to lose it (I've lost about 8-10 lbs in the last few weeks) with slow progress so getting that part of my life under control is going to take time. I am aware that this could have happened coincidentally; and had nothing to do with my lisinopril being increased. But I'd like to know if it's possible that this could be the culprit.,2006,2006,,,,,Hi everyon I recent ER I felt consist flutter chest later turn pvc the ER kept monitor 18 hour I seem averag around 37 pvc per minut wake hour thi total new experi In past I felt flutter mayb 3 4 time year 1530 second total therefor didnt know I earli 50 the test show sign MI thryoid appear good echocardiogram perfectli normal So I sent home basic told worri now I mention doc 5 day prior event GP doubl lisinopril 20 mg 40 mg day I also take 200 mg toprol I take diuret darn stuff make go 15 time day So toprol lisinopril use hypertens At moment hypertens well control Id like two med I quit overweight struggl lose ive lost 810 lb last week slow progress get part life control go take time I awar could happen coincident noth lisinopril increas but Id like know possibl could culprit

1048,Lisinopril+hypertension,I started having BP issues after I had my kids. I have been on the highest dose of Azor; benicar and would get so/so bp but my pulse was high and I was always out of breath. I switched to 10mg of lisinopril with a low dose diuretic and it seems to be ok over all; but I will get readings in the doctors office such as 164/108. At home it's much lower and sometimes when I wake up it's 108/85. When I have a headache or sick my bp spikes to 180/110. My husband has been in pain from surgeries etc.. and his bo never spikes like mine. This new doc suggested a beta blocker but I really want to avoid taking those. He doesn't seem to really care about my health history and I think he just pushes pills and wants his patents out the door.

1049,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi! I'm a 21 year old female who just got back from overseas. While abroad; it was discovered; from a visit to the doctor for an ear infection; that I had high blood pressure. I visited the doctor twice for the ear infection. The first time; I had normal bp; but the second showed an elevated bp and pulse (though he thought at the time that it was due to my taking Claritin-D). I have since stopped taking Claritin-D; but the bp never went down. My most recent reading (about 3 months ago) was 140/95; but the previous 4 before that averaged around 150/85. While overseas; I had the usual blood tests and 24-hr urine; but that showed nothing. I was then referred to a cardiologist; had an EKG and renal ultrasound; (which I assume were both normal since I never heard anything back). I have since returned to the US; so I was never able to complete the other tests (echo; 24-bp monitoring; Holter monitoring) which the cardiologist recommended. I have not been to a doctor in the US since returning because of busy schedule (college and work). How worried should I be about this? Is this something that needs to be taken care of right away or can it wait? What are the likely causes of this sudden change in bp? If I discover that my bp has dropped since returning to the US; is it still an issue? Thanks so much!,2005,2005,,,,,Hi Im 21 year old femal got back oversea while abroad discov visit doctor ear infect I high blood pressur I visit doctor twice ear infect the first time I normal bp second show elev bp puls though thought time due take claritind I sinc stop take claritind bp never went My recent read 3 month ago 14095 previou 4 averag around 15085 while oversea I usual blood test 24hr urin show noth I refer cardiologist ekg renal ultrasound I assum normal sinc I never heard anyth back I sinc return US I never abl complet test echo 24bp monitor holter monitor cardiologist recommend I doctor US sinc return busi schedul colleg work how worri I Is someth need taken care right away wait what like caus sudden chang bp If I discov bp drop sinc return US still issu thank much
1050,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; Feeling dreadful but relieved the doctor's found the cause: hypothyroid (TSH 5.41; T3 2.5; T4 10.6) and started yesterday on levothyroxine 50ug. My Mum's got the same thing and takes 150ug levothyroxine after being diagnosed 12 years ago. My blood pressure's 175/115 and my pulse is 95. Any little thing makes be feel panicky but before all this I was a happy; calm person. Family all has low-normal blood pressure; and my triglycerides are too LOW: 0.53 g/l when the minimum should be 0.7 g/l. Cholesterol normal. Done an internet search and found that hypothyroid can cause hypertension because lack of thyroid leads to loss of strength in the heart; and stiffening of the blood vessels. So; added to this I'm asthmatic; (since age 3; now 43) and take seretide. The asthma's under control. Medicines: Seretide once a day. Since last week I'm on half a beta-blocker at night and calcium-blocker in the morning to reduce blood pressure; and it's helping: panic feeling's gone; pressure was 145/95 yesterday. Since yesterday 50ug levothyroxine; which will probably be increased next month I expect after blood tests to see how it's working. QUESTIONS: Are these medicines okay together; and how long does it take to feel better? I'm a zombie at present; can hardly get out of bed; am freezing cold etc I'm desperate for improvement.

1051,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a professional violinist and recently developed an essential tremor in my bow arm which interferes greatly with my playing. My neurologist tried primidone but it has helped only a little. I asked if he could put me on Inderal which I understand can help with essential tremor. However -- the doctor pointed out that I am already on lisinopril (for hypertension) which; he claimed; ALSO is effective in treating essential tremor. So the upshot was that according to him; there was 'no point' in substituting Inderal for the Lisinopril I'm already taking since Lisinopril is JUST AS EFFECTIVE in treating essential tremor as Inderal. But is this right?? I've read about lisinopril and see no mention whatsoever of its being helpful for essential tremor (Of course I know it's effective for high blood pressure),2008,2008,64.0,Male,,,I profession violinist recent develop essenti tremor bow arm interfer greatli play My neurologist tri primidon help littl I ask could put inder I understand help essenti tremor howev doctor point I alreadi lisinopril hypertens claim also effect treat essenti tremor So upshot accord point substitut inder lisinopril Im alreadi take sinc lisinopril just AS effect treat essenti tremor inder but right ive read lisinopril see mention whatsoev help essenti tremor Of cours I know effect high blood pressur

My cholesterol is also slight elevated. MY bp off the Lisinopril is 145/85 and I see a cardiologist for the first time on Wednesday is it safe for me not to take the Lisinopril till then?

1054,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had type 1 Diabetes for 21 years. For the last five years I've had excellent control. I've had two healthy babies and an A1C of 5.0-6.5. Unfortunately I've had more years out of control than in control. Today my lab results showed protien in my urine. I am not taking this well; even though I knew it was inevitible because of my history. My Doctor has perscribed Lisinopril after I have my third child. My questions are: Are there many type 1 who have to be on this type of pill for life? Is there a way to stop the protien from spilling over even with good A1C? I feel like this is the beginning of a long road of battles. Like it's all downhill complications from here. Is this accurate? So far I've been very healthy; am I a walking time bomb?

1057,Lisinopril+hypertension,On Aug. 7; 2009 I had a dual chamber; rate adaptive pacemaker implanted. The surgery was successful; but I became hypertensive within 12 hours after the implant with a reading of 160+/80 which rose to 203/93. I was given medication to reduce my blood pressure which did eventually drop to about 145/75 . I was discharged and prescribed 10 mg. of Lisinopril daily. However; my bp has remained high at 177-155/93-74. Before the implant it was 140-125/70-62. The pacemaker is set to pace at 50-130 bpm. Has anyone had a similar experience of their bp undergoing a significant increase in bp after an implant and; if so; what was done to overcome the increase ?

1063,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real ""symptoms"" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the ""silent killer"". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its ""gentle"". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now.

1064,Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you. I was recently diagnosed with #1 Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension #2 Essential hypertension; by two PH specialists at a PH Clinic. I had an exercise echocardiogram with PP's of 32mm at rest increasing to 60mm on exercise. My systemic BP also increased from 160/80 at rest up to 180/105 on exertion. I did a 6-minute walk where my initial BP was 142/100; 175/110 at completion of 1580 feet. I was extremely nervous during all these events. The diagnoses was that my PH is related to my high BP being inadequately controlled - Cardizem CD 120mg qd + 325mg aspirin; with my BP on average 142/75 at home. So; the Cardizem was increased to 320mg qd; with the understanding that after follow-up with my (new) doctor 2 weeks hence; if my BP was still high then this dosage should be increased or a second agent added. (Other tests were done during my two days at the clinic; but no RH cath.) On follow-up with my PCP; Cardizem was reduced to 120 mg qd PM and Lisinopril 2.5 mg added AM. I also continue to take 325mg aspirin AM and Lipitor 10mg PM. My question: I recently have been experiencing muscle pain in both the upper and lower portions of my arms - mostly the right arm - pain which comes and goes in frequency and level; PM on average the worst. Is this something I need worry about? I am due to revisit the doctor in three months. I have previously posted here; on the initial diagnosis; of pulmonary hypertension.

1065,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension 15 days ago. I was first put on Lisinopril which after 10 days did not bring my blood pressure down. At which point my doctor wanted to put me on Coreg CR. I have asthma; and have been suffering somewhat from shortness of breath so I had concerns being put on a beta blocker. So he put me on Norvasc. I have been on that since May 29th. My blood pressures are still running somewhat high at times. The problem is the diastolic and the heart rate. Earlier today it was 144/102 but at that point my heart rate was 73. Some of my recent readings are 141/101 pulse of 104: 129/104 with a pulse of 90; 137/102 with a pulse of 102. I have a couple of questions. 1) is it a danger when the systolic minus the diastolic are less than 40 in difference? 2) I did not get to see my physician but did see the PA...and I told her that there is a history of strokes (dad; sister) in my family. And told her that was a concern; is it? She did not seem to think so. My chest does not feel normal. Could that be due to the changes with the hypertension and the medications? I did make an appointment with a cardiologist; but it is not until the 10th.

1066,Lisinopril+hypertension,I just got recently diagnosed with Adult ADHD and started the treatment process. My doctor put me on adderall XR Oral (but on the bottle it says amphetamine salts). I know that there is usually a feeling out process when it comes to ADHD and the various treatments. However; I have hypertension and in my research; I've noticed that this is not recommended for people with hypertension. I started taking it on Saturday and noticed that my blood pressure; (that I was being treated for with atenlol and lisinopril) shot up to about 160/100 on average. This has me obviously concerned. I've noticed the difference in my overall behavior and concentration but the spike in blood pressure makes me nervous. So my questions are this: 1. (and I think I know the answer to this) should I really be concerned yet? 2. Are there recommended treatments for people with ADHD and hypertension? 3. What medications should I look into with my physician? 4. Could increaseing my dosage on my blood pressure medication maybe reduce the effect of the adderall? 5. Is there any blood pressure medication that could help?

1070,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I have posted on this forum in the past in regard to my ""unexplained"" LAD blockage and subsequent CABG. At age 54 after 30 years of very active running and cycling; I was diagnosed with a blockage of the LAD at the bifurcation. The only symptoms I was having was shortness of breath in the first 1/4 mile or so of my daily runs.Presumably; this was due to my fairly extensive collateral network. My risk profile appeared to be benign with LDL of 130; HDL 60; never smoked; not diabetic; and normal ambient blood pressure. Family history was not perfect as father had CABG at age 68 after lifetime of smoking. Mother well at 82. I did find post surgery that my homocysteine was high. In a stress test some months prior to the blockage diagnosis it was reported that the test was terminated due to exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise. I was never told of this. Peak systolic pressure reached 230mm at about 15 METs. More recently; I was found to have LVH with septal wall of 15mm. It reversed to 11mm after 8 months of 5mg of lisinopril. I have now run into an an article documenting severe atheroscherosis and calification in a 30 year marathon runner with exercise induced hypertension with an otherwise ""clean"" risk profile (Am J Cardiol 2007;99:743-744). Is it possible that this exercise induced hypertension is what is behind my otherwise unexplained disease? Do I need to quit running?

1072,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I'm a 63 yr old female who has recently been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and hypertension. I haven't really experienced any overt symptoms of hypothyroidism beyond dry skin and possibly ""brain fog"" (after reading some of the comments of other posts - I think I can identify with that!). My TSH was extremely high (52 -- normal lab values to 2.5) and can't figure out why I didn't have more symptoms. My BP in Dr's office was very high - 177/90.

1075,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a male in my 40's with elevated cholesterol; high triglycerides; slight hypertension and pre-diabetic. I do take crestor; tricor; and metformin to control those and they are now normal. I take Lisonopril for BP. A few days ago; I woke up from sleep with my heart racing; slight angina and feeling a bit dizzy. Went to the ER where they did a EKG; and echo and chest x-ray. None of them indicated any blockage. However; my HR didn't go down even when I was lying down and on IV fluids. It stayed steady art 110-120 and my BP was high. They did a test to measure my BP while I was lying down (135/100) and when I was standing up (168/117) .. so my BP went up on standing. They sent me home with a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and that slightly lowered my heart rate to the 90s and my BP is around 130/90. The doctors couldn't figure out the cause for the episode. I am resting at home at the moment; but I am concerned about taking the beta-blockers. Will this mask a larger issue? I read that higher HR rate typically is accompanied with lower BP; but with me it is the opposite. Also; right after I take the BB; I feel a bit numb and woozy ... it does go away after a while. And a few hours after I take the BB; the HR gets back to the 100s... Any advice on what could be the underlying cause?

1078,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi - I am new to this forum. Starting a few mos ago; I had sudden onset malignant hypertension (250/150!) - always had low BP before this. Coincidently; also developed a 7cm ovarian cyst on left ovary. I have had US (both kinds); CT; and MRI and some descriptions were simple cyst; hemmoragic cyst; complex cyst; endometrioma (depending on who was reading it). Every Dr I've spoken to has acted like it was a something we could wait and watch while they searched for a cause of my sudden-onset hypertension. However; I also stopped having periods since Sept (the hypertension started in mid-summer) and my FSH and LH are very high; so the Drs say I am in menopause. I just turned 44; which I realize isn't young; but sudden menopause? and why is it a functional cyst if I'm in menopause? Also; my estrogen and testosterone are in the range of someone in normal reproductive years. I keep thinking all these things are related; but the Drs act like they are all unrelated coincidences (one guy actually said I simply had incredibly bad luck - rofl). Has anyone else developed hypertension w/ an ovarian cyst or ovarian cancer? My CA125 was 15 and I have a history of endometriosis on the same ovary (endometrioma removed 12 yrs ago). I also have the creepy bloating that many people on here have mentioned and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Has anyone else else had this sort of combination of things happen suddenly?

1079,Lisinopril+hypertension,"This is my first time using this website. I hate to bother all of you; but I have gone 13 months with symptoms now and the only sure diagnosis I have been given is stubborn hypertension. I understand this website is not intended to make any diagnosis; but I would appreciate if anyone could point me in a direction in which to seek help. I am a 22 year old Male. 6'0; 210 lbs. Starting in 10/2014 I started to experience severe sweating (warm); splitting headaches; cob-web vision and tension behind my eyes. Along with this came dizziness; a heavier heart beat; occasional shakiness; and general fatigue. At the time of these symptoms I was not necessarily healthy. I was around 240lbs.; I was taking pre-workout supplements (creatine; nitric oxide); drinking too much alcohol; and chewing tobacco. I went in to get checked out and had severe hypertension in 180s/100s. I was put on meds (20mg lisinopril) and then saw a cardiologist who performed an ECG & Stress Test. He said that all was fine and to take my meds and start living ""healthier"". In the following months I cut-out all workout supplements and quit chewing tobacco which I never used heavily to begin with. I also cut down on drinking and lost about 15 pounds; but my symptoms only seemed to worsen. Within the next few months I had a Kidney & Liver ultrasound; CBCs; 24-Hour Urine Catecholamine Tests; Brainwave Tests; you name it. I saw several radiologists and a neurologist who put me on 25mg of Topamax to control my headaches. Nothing abnormal in the testing; but still symptoms. That leads up to this summer. I had to move to a new city; so I decided to give it another shot. I have had another ECG & Stress done as well as basic blood work; a CT Scan; and an ANA anti-bodies test. Still nothing. My doctor has diagnosed my symptoms as ""generalized anxiety"" and put me on .5 mg of xanax a day as needed. As of now; being on Lisinopril; Topamax; & Xanax my headaches are somewhat controlled. My blood pressure is in the mid-130s/mid-80s; & the xanax seems to chill me out sometimes; but I have begun to build a tolerance. The core symptoms still exist though. I still sweat noticeably easier. I have cob-web vision and tension behind my eyes. I am dizzy and a little shaky as I type this and my body feels like it needs a nap; despite being awake just 4 hours and having had a cup of coffee. As of now I take no supplements. I do not chew tobacco and the only bad habit I have is the occasional binge drinking with my friends once every few months. Having seen a cardiologist; neurologist; radiologists; and multiple general practitioners it is frustrating to have no clear diagnosis and to have only slightly lessened my symptoms. My current doctor has done her due diligence and I do not believe she has done anything wrong or has ""failed"" necessarily. I would appreciate any advice as far as specialists to see or tests to suggest that may help me reach a diagnosis and ultimately a comfortable living condition.

1080,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 36 year old female; 8 months post-op MVR; malignant hypertension; with the following concerns: obviously; the malignant hypertension; for which I have been seeing a hypertension specialist at the University of Michigan for since 2007; and the persistence of the following symptoms: extreme fatigue; shortness of breath with minimal exertion; peripheral edema; pulmonary congestion; cough; and palpatations since surgery. I’ve had two echocardiograms and one transespophagal echocardiogram since MVR all indicating moderate to moderately-severe tricuspid regurgitation; mild aortic regurgitation; stage 2 diastolic dysfunction; mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension (42 to 69 mmHg) and 42% ejection fracture. I’m on the following medications: Lasix; Lisinopril; Spirolactone; metopropol; libatolol; norvasc; potassium; and . BP averages between 165/100 - 245/155. Again; I’ve been seeing a Hypertension Specialist since 2007 and all tests have been ran and repeated numerous times. No cause can be identified. My concern is obviously the malignant hypertension and what it is doing to my heart and other organs but also the progression of TR since MVR. Prior to MVR; TR was trace. I’ve read much on the subject of TR following left-sided heart surgery and am aware that often it progresses instead of correcting itself following the correction of the left sided lesion. I also know that TR following MVR/AVR has a poor prognosis. My question is; should I be concerned with it’s progession at this point? If not; when should I? Also; will my hypertension exassperate all these issues? I sincerely thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I also should add that I sought two opinions for the mitral valve regurgitation; one from your institution; that told me that there was nothing anatomically wrong with my MV and that it was functional in nature.

1081,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I am a 53 year old female without a history of hypertension. In the past 6 weeks; I have had three episodes where I ended up in the emergency room. My initial symptoms came on suddenly . They were light headedness; dizziness and then I would start to get really shaky and almost faint. My blood pressure reading at the emergency room were very high 220/110. I had a full cardiac workup but everything was negative ( ECG normal; no elevated cardiac enzymes; blood glucose normal; pulse ox normal) etc) After the third episode my family doctor put me on lisinopril (20 mg) but I continued to have elevated BP's and some of the same symptoms intermittently but not to the magnitude I had without the meds. The doctor increased the ACE inhibitor to 40 mg and is having me do a 24 hour urine collection to see if I have epinephrine/norepinephrine in my urine to identify whether I may have a tumor on my adrenal gland. Is there anything else i should be evaluated for. is an ACE inhibitor the right med? My resting heart rate is about 65 bpm. Any recommendations or suggestions would be helpful.

1082,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am seventeen years of age; have ideopathic hypertension that is controlled for the most part by Lisinopril; weigh 200 pounds; and am experiencing severe chest pain with exercise. This pain occurs for the most part after moderate or heavy exercise once my heart rate begins to drop back to its resting rate. I can run about 1 lap around the track at my school; its the normal high school track and field running track; before I'm panting for breath and feeling like I'm going to fall over dead if I don't stop. It takes about half a lap to get me all out of breath. The same goes for high intensity sports like Lacrosse; Soccer; or American Football. The pains are best classified as a very severe ache in the middle of my chest. I was placed on a bronchodialator for supposed ""asthma"" and noticed no affect one way or the other. I was then placed on Albuterol and noticed no positive improvement when I tried it before running. It did however cause the pains to occur sooner after exercise and much more severely. I then tried the medication again later that day to try to cure the remains of the pain; and had the pains come back even more severely. I did not seek emergency medical treatment at the time and therefore have no idea what the cause of these pains was. The pains were seemingly timed to my heart beat in that they became more intense when my heart beat. I have experienced these pains for almost two years now. I received an extensive cardio workup in spring of 2010; multiple ekgs (none at the time of the pains); an echo-cardiogram; a stress exercise test (which did not cause the pains to occur; but did leave me very dizzy); and pulmonary function tests (which came up normal); and was told that the only problem was an inconsequential thickening of my aortic valve. The pains have been becoming more and more severe as time progressed since then. They are now far more severe than they were then. I have experienced these pains at rest and as a result of stress as well as a result of exercise. The pains occur when I exercise indoors and when I exercise outdoors. The pains are not accompanied by fever; cough; or abnormal muscle strain. The pains do not occur as a direct result of upper body movement. The pains cannot be recreated by pressing on my chest. The pains do not become more severe when I breathe deeply. The pains do not occur as a result of my breathing deeply. Other symptoms that I have experienced include dizziness after exercise; pounding heart beat at rest and after minor activity (standing or walking a short distance); irregular pulse paired with a tight feeling in my chest; and rapid heartbeat (in the range of 180 bpm) after lifting weights. I exercise regularly at the gym and lift weights. The pains were occurring long before I started lifting weights and were as severe as they are now before I started lifting weights. I have low LDL; high HDL; and high cholesterol. I am not diabetic and I do not have thyroid issues. I do not take medication to control my cholesterol. I do not drink enough water most of the time; but have had the pains occur when I was well hydrated. I was born with a seemingly rare and hard to document non-degenerative congenital myopathy. I have Asperger's Syndrome that could be classified as high functioning Autism. I have not tried taking an antacid tablet when the pains occur. Eating neither causes or cures the pains. Drinking milk neither causes nor cures the pains. I also have frequent and severe headaches. I do not know if these are caused by migraines. I have tried using ibuprofen and aspirin to cure the pains. Ibuprofen did nothing; but aspirin seemed to help. I have never sought emergency medical care as a result of these pains. I am considering seeking emergency medical care the next time they occur. I have not yet seen a pediatric cardiologist again; but I plan to. I am very sorry for the length of this post; I just want an answer to my problem.Thank you.",2010,2011,16.0,Male,,,I seventeen year age ideopath hypertens control part lisinopril weigh 200 pound experienc sever chest pain exercis thi pain occur part moder heavi exercis heart rate begin drop back rest rate I run 1 lap around track school normal high school track field run track Im pant breath feel like Im go fall dead I dont stop It take half lap get breath the goe high intens sport like lacross soccer american footbal the pain best classifi sever ach middl chest I place bronchodial suppos asthma notic affect one way I place albuterol notic posit improv I tri run It howev caus pain occur sooner exercis much sever I tri medic later day tri cure remain pain pain come back even sever I seek emerg medic treatment time therefor idea caus pain the pain seemingli time heart beat becam intens heart beat I experienc pain almost two year I receiv extens cardio workup spring 2010 multipl ekg none time pain echocardiogram stress exercis test caus pain occur leav dizzi pulmonari function test came normal told problem inconsequenti thicken aortic valv the pain becom sever time progress sinc they far sever I experienc pain rest result stress well result exercis the pain occur I exercis indoor I exercis outdoor the pain accompani fever cough abnorm muscl strain the pain occur direct result upper bodi movement the pain recreat press chest the pain becom sever I breath deepli the pain occur result breath deepli other symptom I experienc includ dizzi exercis pound heart beat rest minor activ stand walk short distanc irregular puls pair tight feel chest rapid heartbeat rang 180 bpm lift weight I exercis regularli gym lift weight the pain occur long I start lift weight sever I start lift weight I low ldl high hdl high cholesterol I diabet I thyroid issu I take medic control cholesterol I drink enough water time pain occur I well hydrat I born seemingli rare hard document nondegen congenit myopathi I asperg syndrom could classifi high function autism I tri take antacid tablet pain occur eat neither caus cure pain drink milk neither caus cure pain I also frequent sever headach I know caus migrain I tri use ibuprofen aspirin cure pain ibuprofen noth aspirin seem help I never sought emerg medic care result pain I consid seek emerg medic care next time occur I yet seen pediatr cardiologist I plan I sorri length post I want answer problemthank
1083,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 47 year old hypertensive male. Quick hypertension history: 25-35 years old: normal/high blood pressure; 135/85 36 years old: 140/90; official hypertensive diagnosis 36-43 years old: many meds tried; no medicine significantly brought down blood pressure; but gave bad side effects. 44 years old: lost weight; from 230 to 205 pounds; blood pressure dropped to 135/85; stopped taking meds I now weigh 195 pounds and until recently my blood pressure has been in the 130/80 range and I've felt great. I don't smoke; sleep well; eat well; take long walks with my dogs; lift weights; life is great. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and a shot of whiskey and a beer at night; my only vices. I gave blood at the red cross two months ago; I give every two months. Blood pressure was normal at that time. Then I go to give blood early last week and it was 160/106. Whoa. Talked to my primary care doc; and the readings were confirmed; but she didn't prescribe anything as I have a shaky history with any med working. She just had me monitor at home. Since then I'm getting readings typically about 177/112; with some readings into the 190/120 range; but some lower around 160/105. A nurse friend made me go to the ER over the weekend she was so worried when it stayed over 185/115; but since I wasn't having organ failure; they just gave me a single 0.1 mg clonidine and sent me away. I saw my urologist on Monday for a followup to the kidney stone event I had last year. I had a small stone pass back then and on x-ray they saw a 4 mm stone sitting in my right kidney; so I had a scheduled follow up to check on it. The stone has moved to my ureter and has gotten stuck; about halfway. I've been feeling significant pain on that side since the end of December; but I had a kidney infection which was treated with ampicillin at that time and thought it was all related to that. Oh; my blood pressure at the end of December was slightly elevated (148/92); probably due to the PSGN (it was strep bacteria in my kidney; which causes elevation). Now I have a partially; maybe intermittently fully blocked ureter. My right kidney showed mild enlargement; but kidney functions are normal. The urologist prescribed Cardura to help open up the ureter to pass the stone; and it also lowers the blood pressure about 30/20 points for a few hours. Been on it a couple of days now. If in 3 weeks it hasn't passed; they'll remove it surgically. I'm also getting nausea; palpitations; nervousness; sweats; cold intolerance; racing pulse; irritation; etc.; and have been since early January. . So..... my question is; can a blocked ureter cause a very high spike in hypertension like I'm seeing? I mean; I've basically gone from normal-high to acute severe hypertension in about 2-3 weeks. Nothing about this seems right and I'm very concerned.,2016,2016,47.0,Male,,,Im 47 year old hypertens male quick hypertens histori 2535 year old normalhigh blood pressur 13585 36 year old 14090 offici hypertens diagnosi 3643 year old mani med tri medicin significantli brought blood pressur gave bad side effect 44 year old lost weight 230 205 pound blood pressur drop 13585 stop take med I weigh 195 pound recent blood pressur 13080 rang ive felt great I dont smoke sleep well eat well take long walk dog lift weight life great I cup coffe morn shot whiskey beer night vice I gave blood red cross two month ago I give everi two month blood pressur normal time then I go give blood earli last week 160106 whoa talk primari care doc read confirm didnt prescrib anyth I shaki histori med work she monitor home sinc Im get read typic 177112 read 190120 rang lower around 160105 A nurs friend made go ER weekend worri stay 185115 sinc I wasnt organ failur gave singl 01 mg clonidin sent away I saw urologist monday followup kidney stone event I last year I small stone pass back xray saw 4 mm stone sit right kidney I schedul follow check the stone move uret gotten stuck halfway ive feel signific pain side sinc end decemb I kidney infect treat ampicillin time thought relat Oh blood pressur end decemb slightli elev 14892 probabl due psgn strep bacteria kidney caus elev now I partial mayb intermitt fulli block uret My right kidney show mild enlarg kidney function normal the urologist prescrib cardura help open uret pass stone also lower blood pressur 3020 point hour been coupl day If 3 week hasnt pass theyll remov surgic Im also get nausea palpit nervous sweat cold intoler race puls irrit etc sinc earli januari So question block uret caus high spike hypertens like Im see I mean ive basic gone normalhigh acut sever hypertens 23 week noth seem right Im concern

1087,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am 26 and have taken lisinopril (10mg) and metoprolol (25mg 2x per day) for several years to control high blood pressure. I occasionally smoke tobacco from a hookah. For the last two years or so I have noticed that after I do so my entire rib cage feels very tight; swollen and achy. Then for a few days when I breath deeply or move around I sometimes get pains between ribs (it does not feel like lungs... more like between lungs and ribs or between ribs). This never used to happen and is very uncomfortable. I don't have any issues breathing... no coughing; no mucus; no wheezing... I don't have any trouble doing vigorous exercise. I just get this very irritated/inflammed/tight feeling in my rib cage. Does anyone know if either of my meds can cause/contribute to this? What bothers me is that this never used to happen even when I smoked much more frequently; and the discomfort seems not to have anything to do with my lungs/breathing. Any thoughts or advice???,2011,2011,25.0,Male,,,hello I 26 taken lisinopril 10mg metoprolol 25mg 2x per day sever year control high blood pressur I occasion smoke tobacco hookah for last two year I notic I entir rib cage feel tight swollen achi then day I breath deepli move around I sometim get pain rib feel like lung like lung rib rib thi never use happen uncomfort I dont issu breath cough mucu wheez I dont troubl vigor exercis I get irritatedinflammedtight feel rib cage doe anyon know either med causecontribut what bother never use happen even I smoke much frequent discomfort seem anyth lungsbreath ani thought advic

1090,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter.

Are there safer; just as effective alternatives to Atonolol for her? We are also concerned with the elevated dosages of Lisinopril & Omeprazole.

1128,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 29 yr; overweight and was diagnosed with MVP from an ECHO in Feb. The cardiologist referred me for further eval bc it also showed an est. EF of 45%. I took a MUGA scan in Sept which confirmed this. EF was 47.8%; I had also started Lisinopril from my visit 1-2 wks prior. I was then sent for stress thalium to rule out CAD in which it came back negative and an increased EF of 62%. I also have had symptoms of extreme fatigue very often; chest discomfort; inc HR; and swelling legs. The cardiologist believes my symptoms are most likely due to MVP and not a major heart condition. I would like to believe that and it does make sense from the literature but the reason as to why my EF was low in the first place is still unanswered. He also mentioned a virus could have caused the EF situation but I doubt a virus from Feb-Sept. He increased my Lisinopril to 20mg. What other conditions could cause my EF problems? The cardiologist says that EF fluctuates all the time but it is just odd to me that from Feb - Sept it is approx in the same range and only improved once I got Lisinopril. I never have been diagnosed with HTN but my BP did fluctuate alot meaning sometimes in the pre-HTN stage. Please advise as I am very frustrated that this is taking so long to find out what to do. I would love that it be simple as MVP but the EF bothers me. What should I do? They also eluded to f/u for CT diseases as a cause of the EF problems. I was tested some years ago for Lupus and sarcodosis when these symptoms 1st arrived but they both were negative.

1134,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi! My daughter is a swimmer and runs track in high school (weight:115; height: 5'3) she was found to have high blood pressure while she was at the oral surgeon having a tooth extracted 205/135; we thought the machine was broke. the following couple of days her bp was aprox. 170/120. She is now seeing a pediatric nephrologist who has done blood tests; echo; and kidney angiogram all which came back negative. 1 1/2 months later she is on Norcasc 10 mg. and lisinopril 5 mg. which now is back in the normal range most of the time. Last October at her sports physical her bp was 115/67. So in the last 6 mos sometime her bp went crazy.

1136,Lisinopril+hypertension,Had RAI in 1997; Was on .05mg synthroid until 2006. Taken off meds due to supressed TSH. My last labs showed elevated TSI and TPO antibodies; TSH 1.96 range .34-5.6. T4 .88 range .58-1.64. T3 3.6 range 2.3-4.2. I have been having transient episodes of muscle weakness mostlly in the legs; bouts of diahrea; a rash along my shin bone; get tired eaisly and when working in the yard it is harder to breath. I sometimes get light headed; and very warm when working and sweat alot. At first I had these episodes once or twice a year but have had 15-20 withing the past few month's. I have seen a geriactic dr and an endo who both say that the symptoms are not related to my thyroid because it is normal. Seems like hyper symptoms to me or am I going nuts. Heart; Liver; Spleen; Kidneys all are normal but am on Lisinopril for systolic hypertension and have occasional premature ventricular contractions.

1137,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 42 year old male and having Hypertension since the age of 32. I have tried several Beta Blockers & ACE Inhibitors in the past 10 years. I used to change the medication every 2~3 years when they were found ineffective. Following is a list of medicines I have consumed in the order : Atenolol; Lisinopril; Enalapril & Bisoprolol. Recently when my BP was at a rate of 170/110; my doctor prescribed following medicines : Metpure XL 25 (Metoprolol 25Mg) & Arbitel-H (Telmisartan 40Mg). Now the BP at a controlled level. As I can understand it; first one is a Beta Blocker & other is an ACE-Inhibitor . But; after starting these medicines ; I feel very weak & exhausted . Though I have been taking different medicines in the past; I never felt so lethargic. I can't run a 100 Mtrs or climb a hill.

1145,Lisinopril+hypertension,I recently visited a Cardiologist due to experiencing left sided chest aches. This is not the first time I have visited a Cardiologist as I underwent a Nuclear Stress Test in 2010 (Which came back normal) Continuing to experience the aforementioned chest discomfort I visited another Cardiologist as the former had relocated his practice to another state. Anyway; this time (two weeks ago) I was given yet another Nuclear Stress Test and an Echo. Went back to the doc and received what I perceived as good news / not so good news. Normal Nuclear Stress Test; and “Moderate” thickening of the heart muscle. That is all I remember unfortunately but if I understand correctly this is called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy correct? Anyway; I am a 41 year old white male; no diabetes; no kidney issues; and take Lisinopril and Cardizem.

1148,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello I am a 46 y/o female; NS; ND; who is now at a healthy weight. About 2 years ago-I had several episodes of what seemed to be classic angina. I had a stress test and echo done; and no cause was found. I was diagnosed with MILD hypertension; and treated with Lisinopril at that time. I was about 25# overweight then; and was advised to lose weight and begin an exercise program. The plan was to investigate the chest pain further if it recurred. I had no furthur problems until last week. I (with my docs ok) came off the Lisinopril slowly last month; to see if my weight loss and exercise program would allow me to get by without it. I had a 5 hour episode of chest pain at work last week; characterized by an intense pressure/pain in my chest; radiating to my throat and lower jaw. This pain eased when I rested for a bit; only to resume when I would get back up and resume work. Maalox did'nt help. Saw my doc the next day; who did an EKG (just some LAH noted on that) has scheduled a stress test; and put me back on the Lisinopril (BP running about 140/mid 90's at this point again). and gave me some nitro to carry. Once I began the Lisinopril again; no furthur problems. What would be your recommendations regarding furthur investigation; assuming the stress test will once again be negative? Could the Lisinopril be helping in some way? I don't obsess about my heart; in fact I rarely think about it at all. Just seems funny I don't have these pains while I am on it. Do you think a cath is indicated? Lipid profile pending; OK 2 years ago.

1149,Lisinopril+hypertension,Good morning Dr. I go to see my Gastro doctor ever three months. 523 days ago I was diagnosed with end stage alcoholic cirrhosis. Here are a list of my symptoms: End stage cirrhosis Gall stones Splenomegaly Portal hypertension Varices grade 3 Spider nevi Hepatic encephalopathy Hiatal hernia Umbilical hernia During my last visit to the doctor he told me that “he guarantees that in about 5 years I will be needing a liver transplant; 10 years on the outside.” I imagine he is basing this on the severity of my portal hypertension. My platelet 67; ammonia 61; bilirubin 2.4; GGT 127. 6 months ago meld score 8. At the time of diagnosis 17. So I feel recovery has been going amazingly well for me. The rest of my numbers are all within normal ranges. l limits and I drink probably 10-12 16oz bottles of water a day. Medications: I take vitamin C; B-complex; milk thistle. Other daily meds include xifaxan; lactalose; lexapro and metoprolol. Blood pressure diuretic Lisinopril;Hydrochlorthiazide 20mg/12.5mg. BP is 100/58. Diagnosed at age 38 currently 39 male. 1) Finally on to my question; is it really strange that I don’t have or never have had Ascites or Edema? Is this a problem you see in my future? 2) I’ve tried to provide as much information as possible so I could ask you if you agree with my doctors assessment of transplantation. 3) I currently have great medical insurance through my wife’s work. If we relocate and she loses the insurance I would be eligible for Medicare. Would having different insurance effect the procedure or my ability to have the procedure in any way? Should I consider not relocating? 4) Is there a large risk of a liver not being available at the time of my needing one? 5) Do you have any suggestions for me?

1151,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension/high BP in June when the nurse at work sent me to ER with a BP of 210/120. I was immediately put on Norvasc 10mg and HCTZ 25mg daily. My pressure came down to 160/80 and after seeing my doc he said come back in 6 months. After questioning why I had high blood pressure and not getting any answers I asked to see another doc and he added Lisinopril 10mg and said come back in 6 months. Since then BP has been steady at 130's/40's. After bugging the doc enough about why at 32 i have to take 3 meds to keep BP under control he has finally set me up to see a kidney specialist. I have been experiencing soreness and weakness in my elbows; like tendonitis; extreme fatigue and burning in my arms when doing light work; tiredness and overall fatigue; since beginning these meds. I have to tell you that I also had a diskectomy in my lower backbecause of a herniated disk shortly after being put on these meds; but have fully recovered and take no pain killers.

1152,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi there. First timer with a question about Losaran for hypertension. My BP runs about 140/90 without medication. I am not overweight (BMI of 22; age 57). My GP put me on Lisinopril last year but switched me to Losartan after the Lisinopril failed to help. The Losartan brought my BP down a lot with a 50 mg daily dose. I was down to 110/70 and even 100/65 at times. I even got light-headed when I stood up quickly. The GP said this was normal and good. He likes my BP to be well below 120/80. So far so good. I was getting the Losartan from Walgreens as a 30 day supply. My insurance wanted me to go to a 90 day 'Express Scripts' route since this was a long-term maintenance drug and so I did. Gradually; I notice my BP creeping up and up until now it is back to the 135/85 range. I am using an Omron 785 cuff meter which I have proven to myself is fairly accurate. I even took it to my GP's office and compared it to his reading with a sphygmo. Right on the mark. I notice that the Express Script drug I now use is made by Apotex whereas the original Walgreen brand was Cozaar. I went back to Walgreens and asked the pharmacist if there was any chance that the Apotex was inferior/impotent to the Cozaar for some reason. She assured me that could not be the case and that there could be no difference. Losartan is Losartan is Losartan. As an experiment(with GP consensus); I doubled my dose of Apotex Losartan from 50 to 100 mg a day for one week. No change in BP. I am baffled. GP does not have a clue either. I want to try going back to Cozaar.

1153,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am a 51 year old female with a long standing history of high blood pressure. Up until a couple of years ago; it was well controlled with enalapril and HCTZ. About 2 years ago; when it started going up; Toprol XL 50 mg was added. Still not well controlled; the enalapril was dropped and 20 mg of Lisinopril added. I seemed to tolerate this well without any noticeable side effects. Just recently; BP noted to still be on the high side so a second dose of Lisinopril 20 mg added for a total of 40 mg daily. Since adding the 2nd dose of Lisinopril; my heart rate and BP have dropped significantly. My heart rate has been as low as 48 and more typically is in the 50's or low 60's. My blood pressure is in the range of 100/68 - 110/85. I do not like the way I feel since adding this 2nd dose of Lisinopril. I am very fatigued and almost have a ""drugged"" feeling throughout the day. Questions: 1. Can this medication make me feel like this? 2. Should I be concerned about the low heart rate? 3.

1154,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi All; I'm a 26 year old male with a heart rate question. My sitting heart rate during the day usually ranges from 60 to 80; however when I am standing my heart rate ranges from 80 to 100. When I am walking for exercise; between 3.3 to 4 mph my BPM is between 100 to 120; sometimes 125;130 if its really hot outside. I'm 6ft 240 lbs. I was at 280 lbs just 4 months ago so I've lost a lot of weight through exercise and diet. However I'm not really seeing any improvement in my heart rate. I was an athlete growing up; always active; lifting; running; sports etc; then three years ago I got a desk job and put on 50 lbs over the course of a year. I don't understand why my heart rate increases so much simply by standing. When I'm laying down after waking or before going to sleep my heart rate is sometimes as low as 50. I should also mention I have pre-hypertension; so my blood pressure is slightly high but below 140/90; however my doctor doesn't have me on any meds. I have GERD as well. Additional Information: In February of 2014 I was on Lisinopril for high blood pressure; but after two weeks I had sudden heart attack like symptoms that landed me in the ER. I had several tests done including chest x-ray; chest CAT scan; blood work; EKG; Ultra sound of my heart before and after a stress test. All the tests concluded my heart was fine so they don't know what caused it. However my primary doctor took me off Lisinopril because she believed it was an allergic reaction. However she did put my on a 4 week heart rythm study where I wore a mobile EKG device. They didn't discover anything concerning other than some occasional early heart beats. My doctor said we have all the evidence to say my heart is healthy so I feel confident my heart is okay.,2014,2014,26.0,Male,,,Hi all Im 26 year old male heart rate question My sit heart rate day usual rang 60 80 howev I stand heart rate rang 80 100 when I walk exercis 33 4 mph bpm 100 120 sometim 125130 realli hot outsid Im 6ft 240 lb I 280 lb 4 month ago ive lost lot weight exercis diet howev Im realli see improv heart rate I athlet grow alway activ lift run sport etc three year ago I got desk job put 50 lb cours year I dont understand heart rate increas much simpli stand when Im lay wake go sleep heart rate sometim low 50 I also mention I prehypertens blood pressur slightli high 14090 howev doctor doesnt med I gerd well addit inform In februari 2014 I lisinopril high blood pressur two week I sudden heart attack like symptom land ER I sever test done includ chest xray chest cat scan blood work ekg ultra sound heart stress test all test conclud heart fine dont know caus howev primari doctor took lisinopril believ allerg reaction howev put 4 week heart rythm studi I wore mobil ekg devic they didnt discov anyth concern occasion earli heart beat My doctor said evid say heart healthi I feel confid heart okay
1155,Lisinopril+hypertension,When I recently went in for a chest infection my blood pressure was way out there. The doctor put me on two 10mg capsules of Lisinopril a day.

1156,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am a 54yo white man; mild high BP (140/90) and cholesterol (220) but otherwise no medical problems. Two weeks ago I noticed my right arm was feeling ""floppy"" -- loose and weak. Had it checked out by my PCP a couple of days later; nothing clinically significant found. This has progressed to both arms and sometimes legs though the right side is always more than the left; and the arms more than the legs. My limbs are not actually weak; e.g. I can still pick up my 80# daughter w/ no extra effort; and did gardening all weekend no trouble. Grip strength is normal; but I feel uncoordinated and stiff in the fingers and a little clumsy; I've had pens fly out of my hand twice for no reason; and tripped when there wasn't anything unusual to trip over. I have occasional fasciculations (right arm; left calf and shoulder) and tremors in my right hand and occ the left. Tremors are not new but seem a bit worse; there is a family history of essential tremor. I have also noticed some minor speech difficulties; particularly with ""sh"" sounds followed by things like ""ts"" or ""st"" -- for example in conversation I pronounced ""crushed stone"" as ""crush shtone"" and had to try 3 times to get it right. All this started w/in a week after BP meds were increased from 10 mg to 40 mg lisinopril/day; but I know neuro effects are rare w/ lisinopril. I am an anxious type re health and my big worry of course is ALS. I also wonder about brain tumor; stroke; etc. I know you can't diagnose online but just would like to know what impression all this gives and what the possibilities are.

1157,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello all My doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 40mg when my blood pressure was 170/105 at hospital about 6 months ago. I had dizziness (electricity going through my brain feeling) and fatigue; hard time breathing before the doctor's visit; but even after the medication; the symptoms continued. But; my blood pressure was regulated to around 110/80. Then; slowly; my blood pressure started coming down even more to 100/80; 90/70; then 80/60. So Doctor told me to take only 20mg of lisinopril every day. I did. Then; even more serious headaches; dizziness; and feeling like fainting; and high blood pressure. So Doctor then prescribed Atenolol 25mg per day. One week of trial. Even higher blood pressure around 170/110. So Doctor then advised that I should take both Lisinopril 30mg in the morning; and Atenolol 25mg at night. This has been working quite well for few weeks; bringing my blood pressure to 100/60 almost every time I measured it. But; recently; I started having those peak moments where I would start freezing/trembling; severe headaches/dizziness; and my legs had no strength that I fell few times. My arms/hands felt like there was no circulation; that I coudnt even hold a drug bottle. Blood pressure around 165/110. Then; I took Xanax. This helped almost every time I had this happened to me. But; these days; those happenings where I would have crazy dizziness and weakness in all my body and my blood pressure going up skyhigh come to me more often. Everytime I take Xanax; it does help; but only temporarily. Doctor tells me that I am having panic/anxiety attacks; and the medications actually do work; because all that matters is the average blood pressure; not just few incidents per week. I feel like there must be some other hypertension medication out there that should get rid of these symptoms and get my blood pressure stable. Because when it's stable; I feel OK. These days; not. I have high blood pressure very often even with the medications... not the anxiety attacks... I don't know what to do. Doc tells me to stop worrying and keep my current meds; but I want to change them.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,,,hello My doctor prescrib lisinopril 40mg blood pressur 170105 hospit 6 month ago I dizzi electr go brain feel fatigu hard time breath doctor visit even medic symptom continu but blood pressur regul around 11080 then slowli blood pressur start come even 10080 9070 8060 So doctor told take 20mg lisinopril everi day I then even seriou headach dizzi feel like faint high blood pressur So doctor prescrib atenolol 25mg per day one week trial even higher blood pressur around 170110 So doctor advis I take lisinopril 30mg morn atenolol 25mg night thi work quit well week bring blood pressur 10060 almost everi time I measur but recent I start peak moment I would start freezingtrembl sever headachesdizzi leg strength I fell time My armshand felt like circul I coudnt even hold drug bottl blood pressur around 165110 then I took xanax thi help almost everi time I happen but day happen I would crazi dizzi weak bodi blood pressur go skyhigh come often everytim I take xanax help temporarili doctor tell I panicanxieti attack medic actual work matter averag blood pressur incid per week I feel like must hypertens medic get rid symptom get blood pressur stabl becaus stabl I feel OK these day I high blood pressur often even medic anxieti attack I dont know doc tell stop worri keep current med I want chang
1158,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'll try to keep this brief; but want to include some medical and overall life details. I'm 41; been divorced for just over five years; and met a lady a little over two months ago; and we've fallen in love quickly. I'm not used to falling fast; but I don't regret it. We decided we wanted to be intimate last night; but it didn't work too well. It's been about a year and a half since my last sexual experience. I've also struggled with porn; and am making a big effort to stay away from it; though it's not easy. I want my source of arousal to come from my partner. But there could be a medical root to this as well. I've had issues with high triglycerides and was taking niacin with nicotinic acid and flaxseed oil for a long time. Back in February 2015; I had a heart scare that turned out to be left ventricular hypertrophy brought on by hypertension. My blood pressure was around 145/80; and no telling how long that had been going on. Doc put me on 12.5mg of lisinopril with a diuretic and a statin drug. This helped; but I was totally unable to get an erection. I wasn't sexual with anyone; but that didn't seem normal. Doc prescribed 20mg of Levitra and changed me to 20mg of lisinopril without the diuretic. I used the Levitra to make sure blood still flowed to my penis; but even without it; things seemed to be more normal. After about 2 months and some lifestyle changes that included exercise and cutting sugar; doc took me off the statin drug. When I was married; my ex was really bad about withholding intimacy; and did that off and on for several years. I've been with a few women since my divorce and have been satisfied; but have deliberately kept that number small. Last night; we'd had a fun but busy day. We decided to lie down; and one thing led to another... I took a Levitra and we had foreplay while the drug took effect. I achieved an erection; but couldn't sustain it. I was laying on my back and she gave me oral; and it still seemed to shrink. We got it back up and she climbed on top; and it would last for awhile; but it would shrink. I was never able to climax. Needless to say; it's frustrating. I just wonder if this is a medical problem; or a psychological one. I really want things to work properly. Thank you;,2015,2015,40.0,Male,,,ill tri keep brief want includ medic overal life detail Im 41 divorc five year met ladi littl two month ago weve fallen love quickli Im use fall fast I dont regret We decid want intim last night didnt work well it year half sinc last sexual experi ive also struggl porn make big effort stay away though easi I want sourc arous come partner but could medic root well ive issu high triglycerid take niacin nicotin acid flaxse oil long time back februari 2015 I heart scare turn left ventricular hypertrophi brought hypertens My blood pressur around 14580 tell long go doc put 125mg lisinopril diuret statin drug thi help I total unabl get erect I wasnt sexual anyon didnt seem normal doc prescrib 20mg levitra chang 20mg lisinopril without diuret I use levitra make sure blood still flow peni even without thing seem normal after 2 month lifestyl chang includ exercis cut sugar doc took statin drug when I marri ex realli bad withhold intimaci sever year ive women sinc divorc satisfi deliber kept number small last night wed fun busi day We decid lie one thing led anoth I took levitra foreplay drug took effect I achiev erect couldnt sustain I lay back gave oral still seem shrink We got back climb top would last awhil would shrink I never abl climax needless say frustrat I wonder medic problem psycholog one I realli want thing work properli thank

Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a night of AFib episode ( I was urinating frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out. After the fainting; cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on blocker); I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16 two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark below 50 & record beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin; they were going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on before I was switched off to Lisinopril). Since going to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress; very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp.

1161,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; I am a 32 year old; male; 6'3""; 269 lbs. I have been using Ocean's nasal irrigation and spray for a few months now. My sinuses are still very dry and irritated. As of now I stopped using it and have now noticed that every time my nose gets runny the mucus taste very salty. Is it possible that there is a salt deposit in my sinus cavity due to all the saline use? Also; I was not aware that you should be bent over while using an irrigation spray in your sinuses; so the whole time I have been using it I have stood upright and then leaned over slightly to drain. Also; since then I have recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure. i have never had an issue my whole life...always a 120/80 kind of guy. I was trying to make sense on whether or not this is possibly related or whether it is even possible to have a salt residue left inside the sinus cavity after using saline.

1162,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My age is 70 years and 7 months; but I look and feel maybe 10 years younger. I am very active outdoors especially; with a large garden and yard. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to dig dirt; clear land; cut up firewood with a chain saw; etc. Up until 5 months ago I could work fairly hard for 4 or 5 hours and then feel tired; but a good tired (if you know what I mean) - ready to eat; shower and go to Walmart with my wife.I smoked one PPD until 6 months ago when wheezing was interfering with going to sleep at night. I was able to abruptly quit with the help of nicotine lozenges; and my dosage of them today is down to about 20 mg./day. For one month after I quit; there was a dramatic improvement in my breathing and well-being - the wheezing disappeared after a few days.Then; 5 months ago; I started experiencing dizziness; tachycaria (120's); hypotension (lowest 78/43 - barely able to make it back to the house from the yard) and extreme fatigue - all this with any kind of exertion. My hypertension disappeared a few months after smoking cessation except for something like 134/93 every few days whereupon I take 5 mg. of Lisinopril (half a little blue tablet) with good result. This fatigue is getting worse. Just bringing groceries into the house from the car is exhausting; and I'm very SOB. Occasionally I feel a tiny bit of pressure over my sternum; but nothing to run to the doctor with My medical conditions: cervical spinal stenosis; hypertension controlled with lisinopril; left diaphragmatic hemiplegia; peripheral neuropathy; mild sleep apnea and moderate COPD. The CSS occurred about 6 years ago and was diagnosed with an MRI when I complained of very severe neck pain. They ordered daily morphine which I later refused; afraid of addiction. In any case the pain gradually faded. I believe it was around this time that the left diaphragmatic hemiplegia was diagnosed; but I'm not very good with placing and remembering the occurence of past events with accurately.A recent PFT showed an FVC of 4.16 L. with an increase of 20% with a bronchodilator. The interpretation was: "" Spirometry reveals a moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. There is a bronchidilator response. My PCP has tried every blood test in the book.

1166,Lisinopril+hypertension,I had an MI about 21 months ago. Left me with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. LVEF is approx. 45% (no change over this time period). From echo report of last November there were changes - Tricuspid valve doppler indicates elevated right heart pressure calculated at 55 millimeters of mercury; most likely due to diastolic dysfunction; but abnormal considering patients age (I was 59) Mean pulmonary artery pressure calculated at 30 millimeters of mercury consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension During the period when my echo was done my systemic BP had been running high (140s/90s) for a couple of months; due to added stress in my personal life; but I do not know if my BP was high during the echo; but I think it was likely. For most of the year before last November’s echo my BP had been fine; averaging about 115/70 with a HR of about 60 (I take BP at home routinely and have checked my monitor against the Doctor's BP readings several times so have confidence in my home readings). I was on 6.25 carvedilol and still am. Taken off lisinopril early 2013 due to cough. I was prescribed 50 mg Losartan which I started in January after my doctors visit in which he noted the elevated pressures and BP. My at home readings have been fine all year; running about 115/70 HR of 60); except for the occasional pressure a little above 130/90; and these have always occurred when I feel stressed. During my last doctors visit of a few weeks ago my BP was 143/92 in his office and my home monitor; which I took into the office; agreed. So it appears that at times I have the white coat response. So my question - If the echo was done when my systemic BP was elevated (say 140s/90s) would this make the right heart pressure readings and pulmonary artery readings higher than they would be if my BP had settled back to its normal levels of < 120/80? thanks,2012,2014,59.0,Male,,,I MI 21 month ago left systol diastol dysfunct lvef approx 45 chang time period from echo report last novemb chang tricuspid valv doppler indic elev right heart pressur calcul 55 millimet mercuri like due diastol dysfunct abnorm consid patient age I 59 mean pulmonari arteri pressur calcul 30 millimet mercuri consist moder pulmonari hypertens dure period echo done system BP run high 140s90 coupl month due ad stress person life I know BP high echo I think like for year last novemb echo BP fine averag 11570 HR 60 I take BP home routin check monitor doctor BP read sever time confid home read I 625 carvedilol still taken lisinopril earli 2013 due cough I prescrib 50 mg losartan I start januari doctor visit note elev pressur BP My home read fine year run 11570 HR 60 except occasion pressur littl 13090 alway occur I feel stress dure last doctor visit week ago BP 14392 offic home monitor I took offic agre So appear time I white coat respons So question If echo done system BP elev say 140s90 would make right heart pressur read pulmonari arteri read higher would BP settl back normal level 12080 thank
1167,Lisinopril+hypertension,My mom is 72 and had a 5 way bypass in 1998. She is very active and not overweight. Her meds are Aldactazide every other day; 50 mg Toporal daily; 40 mg lisinopril daily; 20 mg lipitor daily. About 6 months ago; she started having erratic BP with blurry eyes; pain in jaw. BP got as high as 295/135. Went to ER; run blood work and EKGs--nothing shows and they doubled meds; blood pressure comes down sometimes as low as 90/50. Then meds are changed again. Blood pressure spikes. Another trip to the ER. The trips to the ER about every 2 weeks. Over Thanksgiving; she was admitted was high BP-more tests--nothing. Yesterday; she was fine until she took aldactazide at 3:30 and by 8:30 her BP was 232/99; pulse 77. It seems her BP only rises at night.

1168,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I work for a nonprofit company reviewing medical information for MR clients who live in a group home. One of these individuals is taking 5 blood pressure meds: Coreg; Tekturna; Clonidine; Lisinopril; Verapamil. He also takes Lasix. His PCP prescribes him these medications. He also has other health problems; including Diabetes; Gout; Neurogenic bladder; renal failure; anemia; degenerative joint disease. Needless to say; he takes many meds to control these other conditions. I was wondering how many blood pressure medications is common to take? Also; he doesn't have a cardiologist and his PCP is prescribing these meds; which is good that his PCP likes to keep track of all of this; however; I feel that a physician more experienced in cardiology should look at him. His hemotologist also has recently stated he may have myelodysplasia - considering that if thats the case; his blood will be more thin and possibly not require all of these medications. Anyway; I just wanted to get an idea of how many blood pressure pills is common; or rather; how many blood pressure pills is too many to take?

1172,Lisinopril+hypertension,In a previous question posted June 16; Dr. Brown indicated that diabetes and high blood pressure; even if well controlled; are contributing factors to the development of retinal swelling after cataract surgery. I would like to read more about this. Could you suggest resources or published studies backing this up? I have corresponded on this site for three years post-lens replacement surgery with very persistent chronic CME that is refractory to treatment of every possible kind you can name. One retina specialist is most lately suggesting a membrane peel at this point; hypothesizing that epiretinal membrane traction is the cause. This is his hypothesis since there is no inflammatory source; no vitreous traction because I had vitrectomy; no retinal vein occlusion; no diabetes. Could it be something as simple as blood pressure? I have mild high blood pressure that is well controlled with 10 mg daily lisinopril. I would like to know what studies show about this.Can you help?,2007,2010,51.0,Female,,,In previou question post june 16 Dr brown indic diabet high blood pressur even well control contribut factor develop retin swell cataract surgeri I would like read could suggest resourc publish studi back I correspond site three year postlen replac surgeri persist chronic cme refractori treatment everi possibl kind name one retina specialist late suggest membran peel point hypothes epiretin membran traction caus thi hypothesi sinc inflammatori sourc vitreou traction I vitrectomi retin vein occlus diabet could someth simpl blood pressur I mild high blood pressur well control 10 mg daili lisinopril I would like know studi show thiscan help
1173,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had high blood pressure for 10 years now. I have been on just about every medication on the market. I have had a lot of bad reactions to medications especially calcium blockers. I sometimes respond to the initial treatment but eventually; they always seem to lose their effectiveness. Recently after being hospitalized for 5 days (Blood Pressure at time 210/130) I have several doctors with different opinions ; one believes I have Liddle Syndrome and another group believes I have hyperaldosteronism. I have elevated sodium levels;(I follow a low sodium diet) and occassionally have very low potassium levels. I am currently taking the maximum dosage of Toprol; clonidine; spironolactone and lisinopril. This worked fine for several weeks but now my pressure is climbing again; does anyone else have this problem? My test results for various test keep coming back inconclusive or they keep saying different medications may be throwing th results off.

My left leg has always had pain since; so I decided to go see a Chiropractor to see if he or she could alleviate it. After my 5th session I noticed a tingling sensation in my penis and a pulling/retraction pain. I awoke the next morning with a painful erection and ever since it has been painful. Also when I stand or stretch my penis retracts into my body and when I lie down it relaxes. I had an MRI of my back and they said they found nothing remarkable. The doctor also did a physical exam and found nothing wrong. I am in a lot of pain and frustrated. Any help would be extremely appreciated.

1181,Lisinopril+hypertension,Well; diagnosed just a little over a year ago; and other than the initial bout of repeated UTI's; I am relatively symptom free...but then again; perhaps not. I checked this out at the time but it truly scared me more than helped. I was diagnosed with prehypertension the same time I was diagnosed with MSK (by IVP which was the most miserable thing I have done in my life!) and pretty much just thought the pre hypertension was related to menopause. Dr. put me on 10mg of Lisinopril. Check up this week revealed that it was still high - though there were valid life issues such as an unanticipated and last minute mandated trip to India (I live in Michigan and have traveled no where) the very next week which meant 5 immunizations just prior to the blood pressure check. I have also noticed my hair starting to fall out (not a good thing) and have spent much of the morning looking at MSK. I must admit; I do feel bad; because if I have stones; I am not bothered by them...or at least not yet. My Dr. told me when I was diagnosed that I didn't have to be concerned with any foods to avoid and gave me a prescriptio for an antiobiotic that I could take whenever I felt an UTI coming on. So far; I haven't even had to do that. Basically; I guess; there is no real question. Just an introduction; I suppose. Oh; my nickname stands for the standard who; where; why; how and when; thoughts we all must ask ourselves when getting the diagnosis.,2011,2011,56.0,Male,,,well diagnos littl year ago initi bout repeat uti I rel symptom freebut perhap I check time truli scare help I diagnos prehypertens time I diagnos msk ivp miser thing I done life pretti much thought pre hypertens relat menopaus Dr put 10mg lisinopril check week reveal still high though valid life issu unanticip last minut mandat trip india I live michigan travel next week meant 5 immun prior blood pressur check I also notic hair start fall good thing spent much morn look msk I must admit I feel bad I stone I bother themor least yet My Dr told I diagnos I didnt concern food avoid gave prescriptio antiobiot I could take whenev I felt uti come So far I havent even basic I guess real question just introduct I suppos Oh nicknam stand standard thought must ask get diagnosi
1182,Lisinopril+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65.0,Female,,,both parent number close rel vari degre hypertens I start chest pain 2006 BP found 168110 It respond quit well treatment I sent investig I echocardiogram show definit although slight left ventricular hypertrophi felt I must hypertens time I exercis ecg radionuclid scan the result show slight narrow lad consid insignific pain disappear My BP remain 13084 14595 I lisinopril increas 20mg diltiazem 120mg In 2011 I diagnos type 2 diabet I eat healthi diet although overweight lose wellcontrol metformin howev famili histori mean BP consist 13080 june 2012 I start propranolol 40mg twice daili A month ago I start develop similar central chest pain similar 2006 although radiat wors exert sometim present rest My GP would like investig the last two day ive resum home BP monitor seem consist 166100 tonight pain sever enough requir gtn rare thi reliev instantli would point angina I took even medic befor gtn BP 170108 higher five year although I consist medic now still 16393 I think I need medic increas longterm
1183,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi Folks; I recently visited a Cardiologist due to experiencing left sided chest aches. This is not the first time I have visited a Cardiologist as I underwent a Nuclear Stress Test in 2010 (Which came back normal) Continuing to experience the aforementioned chest discomfort I visited another Cardiologist as the former had relocated his practice to another state. Anyway; this time (two weeks ago) I was given yet another Nuclear Stress Test and an Echo. Went back to the doc and received what I perceived as good news / not so good news. Normal Nuclear Stress Test; and “Moderate” thickening of the heart muscle. That is all I remember unfortunately but if I understand correctly this is called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy correct? Anyway; I am a 41 year old white male; no diabetes; no kidney issues; and take Lisinopril and Cardizem. Doc says he wants to see me a couple of times a year for BP / weight check (I’m kind of a big guy) Question is: Do I need to freak out about this? Or is this something that comes with age etc.,2011,2013,,,,,Hi folk I recent visit cardiologist due experienc left side chest ach thi first time I visit cardiologist I underw nuclear stress test 2010 which came back normal continu experi aforement chest discomfort I visit anoth cardiologist former reloc practic anoth state anyway time two week ago I given yet anoth nuclear stress test echo went back doc receiv I perceiv good news good news normal nuclear stress test moder thicken heart muscl that I rememb unfortun I understand correctli call hypertroph cardiomyopathi correct anyway I 41 year old white male diabet kidney issu take lisinopril cardizem doc say want see coupl time year BP weight check Im kind big guy question Do I need freak Or someth come age etc
1184,Lisinopril+hypertension,I always had labile blood pressure after the birth of each child. It jumped up 10 180/110 and stayed for months even with meds. I am done with kids and finally got my bp stabilized on 10-12.5 lisinopril. However even then it has it 's ups and down. I am out of breath often and small activity can drive my bp back up to 180/100 until I sit down. 8 months ago I had a MS relapse; they thought it was a stroke. At any rate my bp dropped to 110/70 without meds. It stays stable for 7 months. Now it's back up and higher doses do not make a difference. I feel so bloated and full; I went to the GYN I do have several fibroid but he didn't seem to see a need to remove my uterus. I been having abnormal sweating and nausea. My blood pressure now is 132/102 or 120/99. If i get up and walk around it jumped to 155/107. All my doctor wants to do is unload heaps more meds on me which will make me ill. I am at my wits end.. tired of feeling tired and out of breath; headaches; chest pain and fullness AND this crazy BP.

1185,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril. About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG; X-rays; MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and gave me one dose of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist. Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg); Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment.

1188,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Age: 28 Height: 6' 1"" Weight: 165lbs Gender: Male Medications: 10mg Lisinopril Smoker: No Current Medical Issues: Mild Hypertension; and Chest Pain. I have been experiencing these symptoms for the past 6 months. As my title states I am concerned about a particular measurement I noticed while reviewing my test results. Here is the test results in total: CALCIUM SCORING: LM: 0LAD: 0LCX: 0RCA: 0Total calcium score = 0 The coronary circulation is right dominant. There are no anomalies of the coronary artery origin or course. Left main coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Left anterior descending coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Left circumflex coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Right coronary artery:No coronary artery atherosclerosis is visualized. Heart:The left ventricle is normal in size. The left ventricular myocardium is homogenous in appearance; there is no hypertrophy. There is no intracardiac thrombus. No congenital abnormalities noted. Valves:All valves appear normal. There is a trileaflet aortic valve. The ascending aorta measures 3.6cm at the level of the sinus of Valsalva and 3.0cm at the level of the main pulmonary artery. Pericardium:The pericardium appears normal. There is no pericardial effusion or calcifications.

1189,Lisinopril+hypertension,So lately I have been having this pain in my right temple. It's kind of on my brow ridge on the right side. I guess you could say it is where my brow ridge is ending on the right side. Anyway; lately I have been getting sharp pains there. They go away in about 30 sec. and usually happen when I stand up and get a head rush. It only happens every once in a while but it always freaks me out. About a month ago I got a CAT scan done because of this and other headaches. The doctor said my CAT scan came back totally normal. No signs of anything bad. Is that good enough? I don't want to go in there and demand another CAT scan or anything. Should I only be concerned if it becomes more frequent and more intense as well as longer lasting?,2007,2007,,,,,So late I pain right templ it kind brow ridg right side I guess could say brow ridg end right side anyway late I get sharp pain they go away 30 sec usual happen I stand get head rush It happen everi alway freak about month ago I got cat scan done headach the doctor said cat scan came back total normal No sign anyth bad Is good enough I dont want go demand anoth cat scan anyth should I concern becom frequent intens well longer last
1190,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

1191,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi Dr. Lupo; I have a few questions about hyperparathyroidism and taking thiazide diuretics and I'm really hoping you can help! I was diagnosed with genetic/weight-related hypertension in August 2006 at 20 years old. At the time I weighed 210 pounds and it was decided I should go on medication to attempt to resolve the problem. I started taking Lisinopril (10mg) and Triamterene/HCTZ (25.5/37.5) and my blood pressure began to creep down to normal. About 8 months later (April 2007) I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's after several years of elevated TSH values and symptoms. I dropped about 45 pounds in the year after starting Levoxyl and was running regularly (have completed 5 half marathons in the past year and have kept the weight off). However; my blood pressure still runs on the high side and has yet to stabilize even with the increased exercise and weight loss. Last fall (2008) my endocrinologist ran a basic metabolic panel and found that my calcium was elevated and my vitamin D was low. She followed the ""watch and see"" approach to see if things evened out. My labs since then have been: Calcium: 10.4; 10.8; 10.3 (range 8.5-10.2) Vitamin D (25-OH): 26; 25 (range 20-100; optimal >30) Vitamin D (1; 25): 74 (range 18-72) PTH: 45 (According to my PCP; my calcium levels in Jan/Aug 2007 were 10.1 and 10.1; respectively; with a range of 8.5-10.5). I know that being on the thiazide diuretic can increase calcium values; but I'm wondering if my hypertension may be a result of an underlying parathyroid condition. I do feel I am symptomatic of hyperparathyroidism (moodiness; loss of energy; tiredness; and my thyroid numbers all seem to be in check); but this one in particular spoke to me. Are there are questions specifically I should be asking my endocrinologist? (I just moved to a different state and am starting all over again).

1192,Lisinopril+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement.

1194,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI of 43.5 and a moderatively active lifestyle due to school/work. I walk 30 minutes every day; at a brisk pace. I have primary hypertension despite a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril (I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide but due to my IBS-D I ended up dehydrated and requiring FRT in the ED). Due to my HR being chronically low; I'm not a good candidate for beta blockers so I'm on Lisinopril which just can't seem to manage my BP. My average resting heart rate is 48! I have a pulsation visible in 4/10 nailbeds that coincides with my heart rate; I've since learned it's called Quickne's pulse. I can't remember the last time I DIDNT have edema in my feet and legs. Some days it's worse than others; but every day it's pitting edema. I get a tightness in my chest sometimes and I can't seem to catch my breath. I'm tired all the time. I've gone to my PCP and had several several blood panels; urinalysis; etc with no conclusive results. I've gone to the ED due to the pain in my chest and inability to catch my breath and was tucked away to finish the cardiac enzyme protocol then shipped home with some Maalox as if it was some acid reflux causing my feet; hands; arms and face to swell.

1195,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm 23 year's old. I recently began to have extreme trouble with dizziness (about 3 months ago) and was told I had high blood pressure. They put me on Lisinopril. I ended up in the hospital a month later (Christmas Day) with chest pains. They then told me they thought the Lisinopril was to blame. They took me off Lisinopril and put me on Atenolol. The Atenolol (over the course of a couple of weeks) lowered my pulse rate too much and started causing my heart rate to become irregular. I ended up back in the hospital where they took me off of the Atenolol and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide. Unfortunately; it too seems to be disagreeing with me; and we still haven't figured out what the cause of it all is. I'll occasionally wake up in the middle of the night; sometimes right after I fall asleep; with a sudden jerking feeling and a need to breathe which usually raises my blood pressure bad. This would lead me to believe I had sleep apnea or something similar; but this doesn't always happen; and the majority of the time; my blood pressure is bad during the day as well. They've done numerous blood tests; thyroid tests; heart and kidney ultrasounds; elecrocardiograms; ran nuclear stuff through my blood stream and tracked it through an MRI; done chest x-rays; stress tests; and hooked me to heart monitors. So far; everything turns up fine according to everyone. I'm still having heart pains; irregular heart beats; bad dizziness; and my blood pressure runs high almost daily.I've been living off of grilled chicken salads with no dressing and drinking water for the past three months; but even a switch in diet doesn't seem to have helped. I really hope I can figure this out soon. My blood pressure this morning was 126/110... the bottom number being the highest it has for some time; while the top was actually low for once. However; the pulse was also 110; and I was only laying down still sleeping just moments before I checked it.

1197,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report. Third echo since Nov 04; this at PHClinic; normal left 'side' at rest incl RV size and function. Est. RV S.Pressure; 32 mmHg (BP 158/90) inc. to 60 mmHg (BP 184/82)at peak exercise(supine bike). Ejection fraction response to stress from 65% at rest to 75% peak stress. LV end-systolic volume decr. with stress. There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'.

1199,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi all; I'm a newbie; so if I'm posting this in an inappropriate spot; please feel free to bring it to my attention. I wanted to do the ""ask the doctor"" forum; but I don't really have 20 bucks to spare right now. ;) Okay; so here is my story. I am a relatively healthy 26-year old female who was diagnosed with hypertension about three months ago. It was discovered during an ER visit for an unrelated illness (allergic reaction to cleaning chemicals at work). At that time; it was 170/110; and the lowest it ever got was 150/105. They chalked it up to ""ER anxiety"" (even though I really wasn't that ruffled) and referred me to my family physician for follow-up; just to be on the safe side. Sure enough; followed up with family doc who found out my baseline was anywhere from 150-160 systolic and 90-110 diastolic. He had me keep a log for about a week; taking it at different times and places; and then after that I was placed on Lisinopril. Hypertension did not respond to that; so then I was switched to Cardizem LA. Still nothing; but it was a $50 co-pay; so I'll be darned if I don't finish them out! ;) Anyway; I've been feeling fine up until Friday. Around 9:00 am that day; I began to feel extremely dizzy (I blacked out for a second; but luckily came right back; still sitting in the same position I was in!) Later in the afternoon; I began feeling chest pressure and sort of an ache in my right breast area. It wasn't a sharp pain; it was as if someone was squeezing my heart. The pain was not constant in nature; but the pressure was. I also noticed that my feet and ankles were very puffy; which is completely new for me. Anyway; I headed to the Immediate Care center after work; an EKG was done and the doc was concerned about some things that he thought could be abnormal. I ended up in the ER; where a cat scan and bloodwork were done; and heart attack and pulmonary embolus were ruled out. I was told it was ""anxiety"" and to ""go home; put my feet up; and rest."" I don't know where they get the anxiety thing from. I do not have a history of anxiety; nor do I feel I have an abnormal level of anxiety. I'm just frustrated because I feel like I've been ""blown off"" because of my age. I just feel like this is not related to simple ""anxiety.""

1200,Lisinopril+hypertension,"This will be my second and last question per the forum rules. I am 49 y/o female; nonsmoker; light drinker; mildly overweight. I have mild hypertension; well controlled on Lisinopril 30mg and HCTZ 25mg. Mild asthma; no meds- rarely need Proventil inhaler. About 3-4 months ago; I began developing exercise intolerance; with severe tachycardia and SOB with only mild exercise; such as walking around the block or going up a flight of stairs. My resting HR is 100-120; without symptoms. I had a stress echo; everything reportedly normal except for my post exercise PA pressure; which was 60. The cardio said he saw ""no cardiac reason"" for this; sent me to a pulmonologist. Had a chest CT; essentially normal. PFT's normal. I had a month long event monitor; which confirmed tachycardia to the 180's with any mild or brief exercise. A sleep study showed no apnea. Tests are pending for collagen disorders. Cholesterol levels great. I was formerly active with no problems. I have no problems at rest. Can you think of anything else that could/should be done or evaluated? Now the cardiologist is backtracking a bit and saying that the PA pressure of 60 ""could be normal"". Is that a fair statement? I know it can vary; but in light of the recent development of the exercise intolerance/tachy/SOB;it still concerns me. He's putting me on Cardizem (while cutting down Lis/HCTZ) to control the heart rate; and plans to ""see how things go"". Is this reasonable; or should there be further investigation?

1201,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 24 year old male. For the past 8 months I am taking a dosage of 2.5mg daily of Lodoz(beta blocker) to counter my hypertension. Although this medicine has brought my blood pressure right back to normal; I experience the following things: 1. These days I usually have a very slow heart rate(45-50). Is this heart rate normal? It has dropped to these low levels only after I started taking the medicine. 2. Sometimes I experience a mild pain in my chest. The pain occurs after every few seconds and then fades away. It is very mild though and does not cause me any discomfort. I sometimes experience a chest pain which I can descibe as a 'pinching' pain. Again it does not cause me discomfort but surely makes me worry. What could be the cause of this pain? 3. I use a digital meter to check my blood pressure. It is always within the normal range 100-110/60-70. However sometimes it falls to something like 98/55. Is this too low?,2008,2008,,,,,I 24 year old male for past 8 month I take dosag 25mg daili lodozbeta blocker counter hypertens although medicin brought blood pressur right back normal I experi follow thing 1 these day I usual slow heart rate4550 Is heart rate normal It drop low level I start take medicin 2 sometim I experi mild pain chest the pain occur everi second fade away It mild though caus discomfort I sometim experi chest pain I descib pinch pain again caus discomfort sure make worri what could caus pain 3 I use digit meter check blood pressur It alway within normal rang 1001106070 howev sometim fall someth like 9855 Is low
1202,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was recently prescribed apo-lisinopril for high blood pressure. I had been getting reading lately at about 130/96. That being said; I have also been under enormous stress lately (new job; finances; child with illness ect) I am not the type of person who takes stress on; but it's been hard to ignore lately. I've been checking my blood pressure at home and usually get readings of 120/85. So I'm just not sure if I want to begin taking the pills if this is something that will pass as I find ways to handle the stress better. Secondly; I occasionally smoke a little bit of pot....to unwind. I find it quite effective....that being said; I'm concerned that this medication may interact with the pot...any input on both questions would be appreciated.,2011,2011,,,,,I recent prescrib apolisinopril high blood pressur I get read late 13096 that said I also enorm stress late new job financ child ill ect I type person take stress hard ignor late ive check blood pressur home usual get read 12085 So Im sure I want begin take pill someth pass I find way handl stress better secondli I occasion smoke littl bit potto unwind I find quit effectivethat said Im concern medic may interact potani input question would appreci
1203,Lisinopril+hypertension,I can't find the person who said his diastolic dysfunction was on the echo one year and gone the next. I would like to know how that happened. My left ventricle is right on the edge of normal 1.1 thickness and I have SOB and chronic chest pain. The heart dr said my shortness of breath is not from my heart and his nurse practitioner said neither is my chest pain and cramping. I'm on 5 mg lisinopril a day cuz I have high blood pressure and that makes me feel lightheaded and faintly . If I just stand up I feel like I can't get any air and feel like I'm suffocating. But oh no;this has nothing to due with my heart. My lungs are fine;they checked that. In 2011 an echo showed I had early stages DD but my heart dr never even told me about it. He told me my heart was fine. I was 61 then. I lost weight and my breathing went ack to normal. Then last yr I gained the weight back and the breathing problem came ack with chest pains. I went to ER and had echo and stress test. I was told no blockage;negative results. Then I asked the nurse for copies and read I developed hypertension during the stress;BP WENT UP TO 180/100 and echo showed E/A ratio .7 DD;stage 1. Now mind you;no one said anything abnormal was found. And I was not on HBP medicine either. So my resting BP is ok but when I exercise it goes way up on the bottom number. I'm on a diet and the heart dr said the million $ question is: does exercise help DD? They don't even know. So I'm exercising will make my heart stiffer sone it makes my diastolic go up when it's supposed to make it go down. This DD is like a nightmare esp. With constant chest pain and SOB.,2011,2013,62.0,Female,,,I cant find person said diastol dysfunct echo one year gone next I would like know happen My left ventricl right edg normal 11 thick I sob chronic chest pain the heart dr said short breath heart nurs practition said neither chest pain cramp Im 5 mg lisinopril day cuz I high blood pressur make feel lighthead faintli If I stand I feel like I cant get air feel like Im suffoc but oh nothi noth due heart My lung finethey check In 2011 echo show I earli stage DD heart dr never even told He told heart fine I 61 I lost weight breath went ack normal then last yr I gain weight back breath problem came ack chest pain I went ER echo stress test I told blockageneg result then I ask nurs copi read I develop hypertens stressbp went UP TO 180100 echo show EA ratio 7 ddstage 1 now mind youno one said anyth abnorm found and I hbp medicin either So rest BP ok I exercis goe way bottom number Im diet heart dr said million question exercis help DD they dont even know So Im exercis make heart stiffer sone make diastol go suppos make go thi DD like nightmar esp with constant chest pain sob
1204,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I was taking Lotensin/Benazepril for a couple of hears for mild hypertension (~145/95) and it was being effective. A few months ago I started having various neurological symptoms including: 1) Numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. 2) Needle-stick like pains in my feet. 3) Trembling of my hands; arms; and thighs. 4) Feelings like being splashed by cold water in my legs; arms; and torso. I had some tests (an MRI of the cervical spine and an EMG/NCV) for possible herniated disk. The MRI was normal and the EMG was ""inconclusive"" according to the neurologist. The connection to the benazepril didn't hit me until one day. I stopped it and over the next couple of weeks the symptoms decreased markedly but not entirely. I had an appointment with my doctor and we talked about it and he changed be to lisinopril. I took it one time and about 2-3 hours after I took it the symptoms; all of them; were back stronger than ever. Especially the trembling. It's pretty clear to me that there is a cause-effect relationship here. So it's been about 3 weeks since I took the lisinopril and I'm back to where I was before I took it. I have some symptoms; mostly the tingling and the needle-like pains. I see that some of these symptoms; while uncommon; are associated with ACE inhibitors. So my questions are do you think these problems are actually caused by the benazepril and lisinopril? If so; are is the damage they may have caused permanent or should I see improvement over time? I'm obviously very leery about trying another hypertension med. I am seeing my GP doctor in a week.

1205,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I'm a 41 yr old female; 5'3""; 130lbs and recently had a abnormal echo stress test. I then had a left catherization done and was diagnosed with ""hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction"". I am on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide meds of which I take 1/2 tablet of a 12.5 mg tablet daily. My cardiologist stated that the diastolic dysfunction is caused by untreated high blood pressure; but I've been on blood pressure meds (hydrochloritiazide) for over 3 years prior to getting this latest diagnosis. My question is whether or not there are any other possible causes of diastolic dysfunction. I've had other symptoms over the last few years (fatigue; weakness/loss of strength; numbness in hands/feet; dizziness; foggy memory; slight carpal tunnel in both wrists per EMG test) and have undergone a few tests (checking for Rheumatoid Arth.; Lupus; EMG test) all of which came back normal. My blood pressure has always been low; in fact too low (81/48 lately) since I've been on the blood pressure meds. I'm just trying to find out if there may be another root cause of why I'm not feeling well.

1206,Lisinopril+hypertension,Started having foot pain and swelling in my right foot only. I have been to the ER and to my doctor. (about 3 years ago; I had tendonitis) At the ER they thought it was gout; but only did an xray (which only showed swelling). My doctor doesnt think its gout; because its affecting the middle of my foot up towards my ankle.(more towards the right side of the middle of my foot) It has also climbed up to my ankle now and starting to get slight pain above my ankle. I have been staying off of it by using crutches - it was to the point I couldnt walk or even put pressure on it.

1208,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests.

1209,Lisinopril+hypertension,I’m experiencing an intermittent dull pain in the center of my chest that feels like it’s coming from my breast bone as opposed to deeper within my chest. It worsens when I lie on either my left or right side. Pressing on my sternum and ribs worsens the pain only very mildly; not nearly as badly as with the bruised ribs or pleurisy I’ve had in the past. I also have “skipped-heartbeat” palpitations. Sometimes when walking briskly; I have a palpitation that produces the sensation that my breast bone is being struck as if by a hammer from behind. Background: I’m 56 years old and have experienced the single “skipped-heartbeat” palpitations for many years; which my doctor has concluded are benign. I’ve also experienced intermittent episodes of lightheadedness and faintness (without passing out) for eight months. Recent tests; all within the past five months; all normal: Treadmill and cardiolite stress tests 24-hour holter monitor EKG Echocardiogram Blood studies; including TSH Chest x-rays CAT scan (head) Ultrasounds of my liver; pancreas and gall bladder. I’ve also suffered from heartburn for years; so I know what that feels like; and my current pain is not similar (I take OTC 20mg Prilosec daily; which has almost totally relieved my heartburn). Other meds are Mirapex for restless legs syndrome and 20mg Lisinopril for mild hypertension. Any clue what this breast-bone pain might be?

1210,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe L3-L4 and L4-L5 stenosis. The MRI report also indicated moderate foraminal narrowing at 3 or 4 disc levels; and the report mentioned desiccation at all but one of the disc levels. The L4-L5 also indicated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet athrosis. What does this mean? 34 years - 6 foot 4 inches; 230 lbs. I have episodic numbness and pain in legs; but also have this problem in arms and hands too (numbness and slight tremor). I also have abdominal pains (mostly ULQ) and fluctuation in stool. I don't smoke or drink. I'm on paxil (mood); lisinopril and small dose of atenolol (hypertension). I have taken paxil and lisinopril for years. I had two ablations for SVT in 2006 - second one caused a PE which I took warfarin for 6 months. No clotting factors. The numbness started in my legs and affects my hands and forearms as well. Sometimes I feel this squeezing feeling either in my hands or in my lower back. When I sit for long periods and then stand up and walk I sometimes get episodes of numbness and weakness that make me have to walk slow and/or sit down and rest. Also I get some strange sensations in my hands and forearms...like holding a phone my hand gets tense and heavy and I have to switch hands. Also; both arms fall ""asleep"" at night; and I am not laying on them. I have a stiff/aching neck for over a year that waxes and wanes; but stays sore all the time. I have had several workups before the MRI. I have normal cbc; liver blood tests; mri of head; abdominal ct; no lyme; b12; no hepatitis; no cmv; blood smear neg pathogens; etc. Normal ncv/emg Could the arm involvement indicate some cervical stenosis? Can lumbar stenosis to affect the arms? Also; the digestive issues - testing (colonoscopy; endoscopy; etc) is normal. Could this stenosis cause this? Are there any diseases that cause the stenosis or cause a more rapid degeneration of my discs?

1211,Lisinopril+hypertension,Two part medical questions : I have been treated for high blood pressure for last 15 years (was taking Atenolol-50 mg & Lisinopril-30mg). Recently; I was diagnosed with palpitations (PVC's) by a Cardiologist. (via EKG test) I was directed by this physician to start taking Atenolol (100MG) and Lisinopril (40MG) as treatment for the PVC condition. Assumption is that by lowering my BP it will eliminate or better control the PVC events. Does this sound appropriate? Since I'm very nervous and apprehensive when these PVC events occur (which probably drives up my PB even more!); would the additional use of Ativan (.05mg) or Celexa (20mg) help calm me while I deal with these conditions .... or would they conflict with current Hypertension medication?

1212,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50 y/o female that has been c/o fatigue; been more extreme since recent bout with viral gastroenteritis. I experienced some SOB and significant edema. Seen by a physician who ran some labwork which came back within normal limits; BNP was 253; she did give me lasix for a couple days for which I dropped 14.5 pounds in 2 days. She also ordered a cardiac echo and stress test for me. Echo showed some regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valve but nothing to warrant further treatment and left atrium dilation; and I believe left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevation...again; told nothing to be concerned with. I've had episodes in the past where my heart rate has dropped down to the upper 30's and then would come back up to 50-60 range. I would say my normal resting HR has always been around 80. So; since they labwork was good; the cardiac tests were fine; my PMD said my fatigue has to be my depression. I personally don't think so but hey; I'll go with it for now. I'm faithfully going to the gym and working out for 1-2 hours 4 days (or more) a week. I work hard while I am there; riding bike for an hour; getting my HR from 130-150+. During that hour though I will see my HR drop down to 60's and then down to the 40's. It will stay there for maybe 3-5 minutes and slowly climb to 70 and then wham; I'm back up to the 130's again. To me this does not seem normal. I'm thinking this may be the reason for my fatigue with the HR fluctuating as it does and not my depression. They have resorted to giving me ritalin to take daily now just so I can function; I hate taking it but if I don't; I certainly wouldn't get anything done. Am I off in thinking that 45 minutes into biking hard and my HR is running in the 40's? I know nothing showed up in the 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill but I can't believe that captured the entire situation. I am on no medications to cause lowering of the heart rate. I do take lisinopril for my blood pressure but no beta blockers or others that would contribute to this. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Would you think a holter monitor be an appropriate thing?

I have been on several medications: Lisinopril 10 mg. (cough); Valsartan 160 mg. (stopped working); Medoprolol 25 mg + Amlodipine 5 mg. (stopped working); now just Amlodipine 10 mg. Since taking the Amlodipine 10 mg. for about a week; my blood pressure keeps going higher and higher. Today readings were between 160/90 - 165/125. Also; my lower legs are sore; I have dizziness and feel light-headed; and are extremely lethargic. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a cleaner medication with better results and less side effects. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

1216,Lisinopril+hypertension,"hi. I am a 21 year old male who is 5'9"" and weighs 160lbs. I NEVER smoke or drink caffeine; and I run four sessions of 3 miles/22 min. of cardio each week. I limit drinking to the weekends (and even then it's minimal); and I do not exceed 1500mg of sodium content daily. I consider myself very healthy and have never had health issues; surgery; or been on meds. nothing at all until now - just out of nowhere. about three weeks ago I had a terrible upper respiratory infection; which sent me to the doctor. he took my BP there and was shocked to learn it was in the 190/105 range; so he ran an EKG and breathing test and both were fine. to be cautious he sent me to the ER; where they performed a urinalysis and another EKG. both were fine. keep in mind; by the time I got to the hospital (10 min later); my BP was down to 156/94 or so. went back to the doctor a week or so later and my BP was still in the high range - now 170/95 or so. he wanted me to go to the ER again; but I refused - saying I prefer taking care of it there since I can't afford to pay $3000 again (I have bad insurance) for the ER. he said fine and prescribed me 5mg of lisinopril and told me to buy a home blood pressure monitoring machine. I have been taking lisinopril and using the monitoring machine I bought (Omron HEM-790IT) for about two weeks now. BP was high at the beginning; but the past week or so has gotten quite better. in the mornings and at night it is around 125/80; and when I return from school/work it is at the most 140/90. I understand the latter number is no good; but I figured it wasn't anything severe enough that an even better diet couldn't change. but again. my diet is already pretty good now here's the odd part: after a week or so of these readings being between 125-140; I went to the doctor's for the first time in two weeks expecting at least SOME improvement. after all; I have been eating extremely healthy; drinking tons of water; and taking lisinopril - in addition to the fact my home BP machine shows readings that are just pre-hypertension or barely stage 1. but when he took my BP; it was STILL in the 170s. I was shocked and he just let out a sigh of disappointment. he prescribed me hydrochlorothiazide to take along with lisinopril; and told me to come back tomorrow after taking a dose of both tonight and tomorrow. he also told me to bring my BP machine; just to compare readings. now; I know what white coat hypertension is; but I thought it only allowed your BP to raise maybe 10 points above normal. I certainly did not anticipate a growth in 30-40 points! I am extremely stressed about this situation... I'm only 21 years old; work out a lot; eat healthy; don't smoke... why is this happening to me? I initially thought it was just due to my respiratory infection; but that has been gone for almost 2 weeks and my high BP is still present. I'm a college student so I am somewhat stressed; but nothing too severe. I feel fine - never any headaches; aches; or anything like that. the only thing that's stressing me out right now is this darn BP. it just seems like I can't do anything... I eat healthy; do everything right; but still... I don't want to be on meds forever it would at least help if the meds were working when I went to the doctor's... any thoughts or suggestions? I have a lot of stress and anxiety BECAUSE of my BP situation; which just makes it worse. I really value my life and will do anything to remain healthy. it's just seems that I can't to do anything to combat this! :(",2011,2011,,Male,,,hi I 21 year old male 59 weigh 160lb I never smoke drink caffein I run four session 3 miles22 min cardio week I limit drink weekend even minim I exceed 1500mg sodium content daili I consid healthi never health issu surgeri med noth nowher three week ago I terribl upper respiratori infect sent doctor took BP shock learn 190105 rang ran ekg breath test fine cautiou sent ER perform urinalysi anoth ekg fine keep mind time I got hospit 10 min later BP 15694 went back doctor week later BP still high rang 17095 want go ER I refus say I prefer take care sinc I cant afford pay 3000 I bad insur ER said fine prescrib 5mg lisinopril told buy home blood pressur monitor machin I take lisinopril use monitor machin I bought omron hem790it two week BP high begin past week gotten quit better morn night around 12580 I return schoolwork 14090 I understand latter number good I figur wasnt anyth sever enough even better diet couldnt chang diet alreadi pretti good here odd part week read 125140 I went doctor first time two week expect least some improv I eat extrem healthi drink ton water take lisinopril addit fact home BP machin show read prehypertens bare stage 1 took BP still 170 I shock let sigh disappoint prescrib hydrochlorothiazid take along lisinopril told come back tomorrow take dose tonight tomorrow also told bring BP machin compar read I know white coat hypertens I thought allow BP rais mayb 10 point normal I certainli anticip growth 3040 point I extrem stress situat Im 21 year old work lot eat healthi dont smoke happen I initi thought due respiratori infect gone almost 2 week high BP still present Im colleg student I somewhat stress noth sever I feel fine never headach ach anyth like thing that stress right darn BP seem like I cant anyth I eat healthi everyth right still I dont want med forev would least help med work I went doctor thought suggest I lot stress anxieti becaus BP situat make wors I realli valu life anyth remain healthi seem I cant anyth combat
1217,Lisinopril+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times.

1219,Lisinopril+hypertension,Am I addicted to Lorazepam after only 2 weeks on .5 mg 2 times a day? A few days ago; I tapered down to .5 mg once a day and it seemed more or less fine but yesterday I didn't take my dose at all and then in the evening started feeling terrible: got really dizzy after some moderate exertion. Things are complicated by the fact that I also two weeks ago started on 10 mg Lisinopril for hypertension. In late evening; my heart and pulse began to race. I then took a .5 mg Lorazepam but I continued to have these frightening symptoms for hours. Could it have been due not to side effects of the Lisinopril but to withdrawal from Lorazepam? How would I taper off such a low dose?

1220,Lisinopril+hypertension,My electrophysiolgist/cardiologist prescribed Coreg and Lisinopril for my condition. I have episodes of ventricular tachycardia; apparently brought on by a focal wall abnormality in my left ventricle. I also have atrial fibrillation. I have an ICD as well. When I mention to other doctors that I take these medications; they insist I must have high blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure and never have. My EP says he prescribed these drugs in order to lighten the work load on my heart and I think increase or at least keep my EF stable. He also says the Coreg can reduce the arrhythmia.

1221,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 44 yo man with chronic refractory hypertension. I am currently taking minoxidil; lasix; lopressor; lisinopril; felodipine and K-dur (not to mention some other drugs for other conditions). Even with these meds; I have only marginal bp control. In the past 6 months; my health has declined significantly. Whereas I had been excercising vigorously for 1-1.5 hours 4-6 times per week; I cannot excercise at all now because I get winded within 30 seconds orso of starting. I am extremely fatigued and am having some trouble with mental status. There are other problems too. I have seen nephrologists and endocrinologists; all to no avail. Some of my blood work has been slightly abnormal to franly abnormal (testosterone severely low; HGH low; mild anemia; metanephrines high; etc.) but the md's all chalk it up to overweight (I am 40 or 50 lbs too heavy for my height and body type. I have gained weight on account of not being able to exercise). Recently; I was sent to a pulmonologist who sent me to have a b-type natiuretic peptide test. I got the result last night. It was 153 pg/ml. I haven't done enough research yet to know what this means. I am having an echocardiogram and nuclear scan to evaluate my lungs next week.

1222,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 71-year-old with a history of hypertension and COPD and now diagnosed with hypertropic cardiomyopathy. I had a syncopal episode in December. My echocardiogram showed septal hypertrophy at 17 mm with a hyperdynamic ventricle with an EF of 75%; with accelerated outflow track velocity outflow of 2 metersper second; corre;ating to a mean gradient of 10 mmHg. There is mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. There was no pericardial effusion. My end-diastolic dimension was 45 mm. My left atrial size was 45 mm.I had a positive tilt table test. The 24-hour Holter monitor showed runs of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. A preliminary electrophysiologic study was done which showed no inducible; monomorphic VT; polymorphic VT; or VF with programmed stimulation; nor could the Doctor induce any automatic VT with burst pacing. My previous medication (Hytrin and a diuretic) was changed to Lopressor; 100 mg twice a day and lisinopril; 40 mg once a aday. I remain hypertensive with blood pressures ranges from 180-205 over 120-140. The change in medication inproved the periodic dizziness and episodes of flushing and near syncope. However; I am still dyspneic on exertion This is worse after eating. DOCTOR SAYS MY dyspnea may; in fact; be multifactorial; including COPD and obesity. QUESTION: I am concerned over my high blood pressure and my short and my shortness of breath. Are these a result of hypertropic cardiomyopathy?

1223,Lisinopril+hypertension,"An echo done early this year shows significantly improved numbers from one two years earlier. EF jumped from 66% to 74%; and LVID dropped from 58mm to 53mm. (The echo report defines the normal range as 37 - 53mm.) MVR was described as moderate in both echos; although the latest one says it may be higher due to an ""excentric jet directed anteriorly.""

1224,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello and thanks for entertaining my question. I am a 58 yo male who had CABG 4 years ago due to an LAD blockage at the bifurcation. I had what I thought was a very good risk profile with LDL/HDL of 130/60; normal BP; and a 30 year history of competitive running and cycling. Family history fairly benign. In trying to find the ""smoking gun""; why I had a blockage; I considered exercise induced hypertension that I was aware of (via a treadmill) considering the 10 to 15 hours of strenuous training I maintained. I also found that blood pressure taken at my ankle was 10 to 20 points higher than that at the arm. I wondered whether I was being fooled by a low arm reading and I was really hypertensive the whole time. More recently; I was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy (vent wall and septum 15 mm)with still normal blood pressure. 6 months of 5mg lisinopril and 3 mo of 25 mg Toprol for atrial fib caused it regress to 11 mm. I have had no further problems with Afib for the last several months either although that may be due to the magnesium supplements I have been taking. I have read some recent medical journal articles talking about the difficulty of finding the true aortic blood pressure with the normal arm cuff. Is it possible that has been my problem all along?

In 2004 I was diagnosed with exercise-induced PH by a specialist in the field; and this was put down as being due to my high blood pressure being uncontrolled. My PAP at the time was 78. The next year I had another opinion with another very well-respected PH specialist; and he told me that he did not agree with the first diagnosis. I now see a cardiologist in the small town where I live; and my PAP at the latest echo was 31. I am 63; my medication is diltiazem; lisinopril; maxide and an aspirin. I don't and have never smoked.

The docs diagnosed me with mono and said to rest. Though I was feeling better; sympoms persisted and blood pressure stayed high (130 to 160/70). Recently my symptoms have come back and I went to the ER one day and they kept me in the hospital for two days doing many tests...ekg; chest xray; kidney ultrasound; blood tests; 24hr urine; etc... nothing. Getting very frustrated but I'm trying to keep cool and figure out my problem. Current symptoms: High blood pressure; dizziness; tingling in hands and feet; fatigue/tiredness; heart pounding and heartbeat sensation throughout my body; forehead pressure; visual disturbances (tired eyes); slight chest tightness/pain; shortness of breath; hard (not enlarged) lymph nodes in groin and neck/jaw. I'm now on lisinopril for high blood pressure because the doc said I had to go on it even though we don't know why it's occuring. It hasn't lowered yet (i just started on it 2 days ago) Thanks for any ideas!,2006,2009,,,,,Hi Im 21 year old male healthi weight 5 year ago I told I blood pressur elev I dizzi spell anxieti occasion pound headach when I 18 symptom got worsechest pain dizzi hbp gener malais lymph node jaw neck groin becam hard swollen still the doc diagnos mono said rest though I feel better sympom persist blood pressur stay high 130 16070 recent symptom come back I went ER one day kept hospit two day mani testsekg chest xray kidney ultrasound blood test 24hr urin etc noth get frustrat Im tri keep cool figur problem current symptom high blood pressur dizzi tingl hand feet fatiguetired heart pound heartbeat sensat throughout bodi forehead pressur visual disturb tire eye slight chest tightnesspain short breath hard enlarg lymph node groin neckjaw Im lisinopril high blood pressur doc said I go even though dont know occur It hasnt lower yet start 2 day ago thank idea
1231,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 32yr old f and have passed out off and on my whole life.....if I get too hot; agitated; sometimes no reason at all. Lately when it happens I have no warning. I've been to the er quite a few times for tachycardia(sinus)....I have mild hypertension.....I take metroprolol and lisinopril. I've also had SOB and palpitations. I seem to be able to do daily tasks but there are days where I feel like my arms and legs weigh a hundred pounds and it takes major effort just to function.....very fatigued like I worked out the day before......I am 112lbs and normally very active so this is very bothersome. My ekgs show up normal except for the tachy and sometimes brady too. The doc heard a murmur and requested an echo...this murmur by the way seems to come and go. THE ECHO STATES: normal lv function at 55%EF;trace MR and TR;no valve vegetations; abnormal apical hypertrophy of the apex....apex shows thickening consistant with focal cardiomyopathy......everything else is normal.There are a bunch of measurements if it helps...I was concerned over the RSVP number being a little high38.3 at rest.........could this small cardiomyopathy be what's causing my problems or should I look somewhere else? I also have chest pain with exertion.....Heart disease runs rampant in my family and both mom and dad died very young of stroke and heart attacks. My doc isn't too concerned and thinks it may be anxiety however my cardiologist wants a stress echo......does she maybe see a problem or just being thorough? I'm willng to except anxiety but I find it really hard to believe....does my age and gender account for the not being taken very seriously?

1232,Lisinopril+hypertension,Since the beginning of this year I have been getting pretty ill. I would feel ok one minute than the next I would have some diarrhea and some vomiting most recently I had a lot of vomiting diarrhea and when I get these episodes I would sweat profusely and get verry weak and tired. I would go to the emergency room and they would tell me that it either my diet change ( as per my Endocrinologist ) or most recently food poisoning ( I was told my white blood cell count was a little high; they didn’t give me antibiotics ) which is why they called it food poisoning or they’d say I had a drop in potassium/dehydration.

He was diagnosed with hypertension and is currently taking metoprolol and lisinopril. These meds seem to be taking care of his blood pressure; but he's still experiencing an ongoing problem with his heart rate; shortness of breath and fatigue. For no apparent reason; his heart rate will jump to 130-165 even at rest. These episodes are intermittent and last less than a minute and occur several times a day. At the advise of this doctor; he stopped drinking beer; pop; and coffee over 3 months ago but has had no affect.

1234,Lisinopril+hypertension,This might be more suited to another forum but the others were closed to comments. Anyways; I'm a 50 year old male that's been having some issues with altitude illness. Last year I had a bout with hypertension as well. This may have resulted from residing at high altitude I'm not sure; but my work requires me to spend time at altitude. Since I will be returning again; I would like to make acclimatization as painless as possible. I had a physical today and my BP is normal without meds now; averaging 119/64. I was on 20mg Lisinopril and 5mg Norvasc earlier this year and they were discontinued. I've been working very hard on physical conditioning and diet to get ready for the altitude again. My cholesterol runs about 100. I asked my doctor if Diamox would help with acclimitization and he said yes; but that it would deplete my electrolytes such as potassium and that he would recommend Triamterene/HCTZ 37.5/25 instead. I'm not sure I understand why. I thought Diamox was the medicine of choice for acute mountain sickness (AMS) since it increases oxygen delivery.,2012,2012,49.0,Male,,,thi might suit anoth forum other close comment anyway Im 50 year old male that issu altitud ill last year I bout hypertens well thi may result resid high altitud Im sure work requir spend time altitud sinc I return I would like make acclimat painless possibl I physic today BP normal without med averag 11964 I 20mg lisinopril 5mg norvasc earlier year discontinu ive work hard physic condit diet get readi altitud My cholesterol run 100 I ask doctor diamox would help acclimit said ye would deplet electrolyt potassium would recommend triamterenehctz 37525 instead Im sure I understand I thought diamox medicin choic acut mountain sick am sinc increas oxygen deliveri
1235,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My question concerns cholesterol values. My wife is 56 yo. She has high a cholesterol value; but very high HDL's. Specifically: TC 285 Trigly 63 HDL 82 LDL 190 Chol/HDL 3.5 To complicate matters; she does have a 2nd risk fa; in that she has had elevated BP readings in the past;(during a period of stress) for which Lisinopril had brought it down to 110/70. In fact; we are weaning her from it currently. Thus; that's only ""sort of"" a risk factor. Of course; even with no risk fa's; I realize the LDL is high.

1236,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have mild hypertension for which I take Lisinopril. My doctor requires that I have lab work every year or so to monitor my cholestrol & HDL/LDL as well as ALT and Triglyceride levels. These were all fine last year (HDL was at the low end of normal). I also have a history of endometriosis and last year my Gyn put me on Jolessa because I increased pain I was experiencing. I took the Jolessa for just under a year and just stopped taking it in mid-January. In mid-February I had new blood work tests performed. My HDL/LDL were good (40/132); my cholestrol was a bit high; my Triglycerides and ALT were very high (373 and 73 respectively). I very very rarely drink alchohol - a glass of wine or beer in a month on average - and had not had any alchohol several weeks prior to this last test (and even then only 1 glass).

I was put on Losartan 100/mg -Hctz 25mg shortly after my Bp was over 140/80 a couple visits to the doc. It now runs 135/75 when I check it usually sometimes 127; or 142 just depends I guess.

1240,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am a 50 year old man and have been diabetic for 5 years now; I have also been diagnosed with hypertension about a year ago. When I was diagnosed I was 5'9"" and 180lbs. and in decent shape. Diabetes is rampant in my family with both my parents and half of my grandparents and plenty of my uncles and aunts are and were diabetic so I know genetics is a big factor here to. I have just started a diet and exercise regime where I'm eating less than a thousand calories a day( no starches; pasta or other high carb food only oats and lean meat and green veggies) and working out with weights for 1/2 hour the running for a half hour ( I can still bench 250 and run a 6 1/2min mile). My next A1c check is in June and I'm hoping that my A1c will be under 6 but half of this one will be before the diet started so I will be patient and also wait till the next and hopefully it will be closer to 5.5. I am on glyburide 5mg 2x a day and metformin 1000mg 2x a day and just started losartan 50mg once a day. Was taking lisinopril hctz 20-12.5 once daily but had some side effects that I didn't like. I was wondering if by doing this I could put my diabetes into remission like some of the participants in the Newcastle study did or if genetics might have me screwed. Has anybody else had any experience with being able to get off there meds with a lifestyle change. I know according to the charts I was overweight by about 12 lbs back then;I wasn't going to the gym at that time but I was far from a couch potato. I'm not sure what is causing my insulin resistance and hbp. I'm just very unhappy with how things have turned out. Turning 50 has caused me to rethink my thoughts on taking meds and winding up like my most of my relatives who take 10 or so meds daily. Three to me is three to many. I was hoping my biggest mid life crisis decision would be what type of sports car to buy not this. Any personal experiences with being able to get off meds or not would be greatly appreciated.

I'm afraid to take anything else. I was told I have essential Hypertension. With the information listed above; what else could be done? The beta blockers seem to work best on keeping the blood pressure down. However I'm told people with asthma should not take them. Q.How exactly do beta blockers cause problems for asthmatics? What is a similiar drug; that could be used in it's place? I feel like my concerns are not being addressed. Maybe I'm not asking enough questions or the right questions. Q.

1244,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Does anyone have experience with hyperparathyroidism diagnoses and the use of thiazide diuretics? I'm new to this board and am trying to find out all I can before I meet with a new endocrinologist in a few weeks so I know what to ask and what issues I should be aware of. Here's a bit of background info: I was diagnosed with genetic/weight-related/idiopathic hypertension in August 2006 at the ripe old age of 20 years old. At the time I weighed 210 pounds and it was decided I should go on medication to attempt to resolve the problem. I started taking Lisinopril (10mg) and Triamterene/HCTZ (25.5/37.5) and my blood pressure began to creep down to normal. About 8 months later (April 2007) I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's after several years of elevated TSH values and being incredibly symptomatic. I began feeling a lot better; started training for a half marathon; and really watched what I was eating. I dropped about 45 pounds in the year after starting Levoxyl and was running regularly (have completed 5 half marathons in the past year). However; my blood pressure still runs on the high side and has yet to stabilize even with the increased exercise and weight loss. Last fall (2008) my endocrinologist ran a basic metabolic panel and found that my calcium was elevated and my vitamin D was low. She followed the ""watch and see"" approach to see if things evened out. My labs since then have been: Calcium: 10.4; 10.8; 10.3 (range 8.5-10.2) Vitamin D (25-OH): 26; 25 (range 20-100; optimal >30) Vitamin D (1; 25): 74 (range 18-72) PTH: 45 I know that being on the thiazide diuretic can increase calcium values; but I'm wondering (sorta hoping; actually) if my hypertension may be a result of an underlying parathyroid condition. I do feel I have other symptoms of hyperparathyroidism; but this one in particular spoke to me. Does anyone have a similar background or experience with something like this? I'd rather not be an athletic 23-year old; 165lb woman with high blood pressure. I recently moved to a new state and am awaiting an appointment with a new endocrinologist at a major university medical center and I want to make sure I'm asking the right kinds of questions.

1245,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been experiencing very bloated; swollen; painful; stiff ankles for about a year now. If my pressure goes up above 110 over 70 flat; then my ankles swell a lot; and it takes doubling up on all hypertension medications to break the cycle and come all the way down to 110 over 70 flat. But if I have to stay up late; or if I have a lot of going to do; or if I have to go up and down a lot of stairs; which happens often; or if I get stressed out for three days in a row; MY ANKLES BLOW UP AND STAY UP UNTIL I OVER MEDICATE DOUBLING UP ON ALL THREE MEDICATIONS FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

1246,Lisinopril+hypertension,Went in to see the doc last week for my annual physical and he looked at my blood pressure history and decided to take me off the meds. I've been averaging 109/65 for the past year or so and he felt it was stable enough to try coming off. Since going on the meds in 2005; I have changed my lifestyle and started exercising every day and doing so lost about 70 pounds; but could still lose another 50 or so. It's been a week; no noticeable difference so far. Don't know how I feel about it yet; I've been on them so long. I wonder how long it would take for my blood pressure to increase again if it was going to. I would love to stay off them; but don't want to go back to the numbers I had before.

I am a 53 yr old female; approximately 35 lbs overweight; with high BP for which I am on several medications to control. I have already lost quite a bit of weight over the past yr (about 40 lbs) and my BP has steadily lowered; resulting in the need to decrease my dosages as I have been bottoming out at mid-day with readings as low as 90/50 and heart rates ranging from 45 to 62; depending on activity; but averaging 52-55 resting rate. I believe that I am on entirely too much medication however an additional health factor makes it dangerous to make drastic changes in medications that could cause rebound highs. I suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm in 2006 that was successfully coiled and I miraculously recovered from with no impairments or after effects. Unfortunately; my family history combined with difficult to manage weight later caused my hypertension to surface which is extremely dangerous to the stability of the coiled aneurysm. It is therefore vital to keep it under control for more reasons than heart health. A sudden spike could cause the aneurysm to re-rupture; leak; or loosen the coils that currently are sealing off the aneurysm; allowing a new re-bleed. Therefore despite a lot of adverse side effects from the BP meds; doctors are slow in reducing or changing them. My main problem now is the slow heart rate which is making me feel tired; have frequent dull headaches; and often dizzy or light headed. My worst time of day seems to be between around 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. I am on several BP meds which include 20-12.5 mg Lisinopril HCTZ; 0.1 mg Clonidine HCL; 30 mg Nifedical XL (recently reduced from 60 mg; which was reduced from 90 prior to that); and 10-6.25 mg Bisoprolol HCTZ. These are FIVE different drugs. I'm honestly surprised I don't have more side effects. My question is; does anyone know which of these drugs would be the biggest cause of the slow heart rate? I have read that some BP medications are known to cause slow heart rate as a side effect however have been unable to find which ones. My doctor agrees that they are what is causing it however we have already had one episode of rebound hypertension when attempting to remove just the HCTZ ingredient. The gradual reduction of the Nifedical XL has been symptom free however it has not reduced the midday low readings and slow heart rate; either. If anyone has any further insight on these drugs and their side effects I would appreciate it. Thanks!,2010,2010,,Female,,,Hi I new member post follow commentquest old post 2007 detail similar situat I question sinc someth I current deal look insight I thought I would repost current question I 53 yr old femal approxim 35 lb overweight high BP I sever medic control I alreadi lost quit bit weight past yr 40 lb BP steadili lower result need decreas dosag I bottom midday read low 9050 heart rate rang 45 62 depend activ averag 5255 rest rate I believ I entir much medic howev addit health factor make danger make drastic chang medic could caus rebound high I suffer ruptur cerebr aneurysm 2006 success coil I miracul recov impair effect unfortun famili histori combin difficult manag weight later caus hypertens surfac extrem danger stabil coil aneurysm It therefor vital keep control reason heart health A sudden spike could caus aneurysm reruptur leak loosen coil current seal aneurysm allow new reble therefor despit lot advers side effect BP med doctor slow reduc chang My main problem slow heart rate make feel tire frequent dull headach often dizzi light head My worst time day seem around 400 PM 600 PM I sever BP med includ 20125 mg lisinopril hctz 01 mg clonidin hcl 30 mg nifed XL recent reduc 60 mg reduc 90 prior 10625 mg bisoprolol hctz these five differ drug Im honestli surpris I dont side effect My question anyon know drug would biggest caus slow heart rate I read BP medic known caus slow heart rate side effect howev unabl find one My doctor agre caus howev alreadi one episod rebound hypertens attempt remov hctz ingredi the gradual reduct nifed XL symptom free howev reduc midday low read slow heart rate either If anyon insight drug side effect I would appreci thank
1248,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks",2008,2008,,,,,hello Dr I 33 year old male hypertens bicuspid aorta for year I great deal health anxieti manifest fast heart rate occasion palpit mayb arrythmia etc doctor believ anxieti play role hypertens I take 25mg atenolol 20mg lisinopril daili bp read avg 13085 My problem Im alway scare sudden death Im athlet I work 45 time week whenev I read athlet suddenli die heart relat problem Im sure also happen ive worn holter monitor get regular echo due bicuspid diagnosi stress echo event monitor theyv never realli found anyth stenosi cardiomyopathi etc So I feel pretti comfort structur heart fine wont caus problem I still worri electr problem would seen thing like brugada syndrom long QT syndrom recogn problem vagal tone etc should I ask see EP cardiologist well basic current symptom occasion flutter especi right I fall asleep occasion rapid heart rate feel weaker normal accompani sensat base neck carotid arteri vagu nerv for reason I shake fear thank

Had total knee replacement 9 months prior and complained of pain in calf & thigh several weeks post-op. History of DVTs in lower legs while pregnant 32 yrs ago.

Had nasty side effects from Coumadin; now on Xarelto. Hemotologist plans to do repeat CT scan W/contrast in 6 months. Planning to keep me on Xarelto for 9 months; then once discontinued; do testing to check for that clotting factor. Still having chest pain; mild shortness of breath; coughing and BP is unstable.

1251,Lisinopril+hypertension,Are connective tissue disorders autoimmune disorders? What types are there? Right now; doc has me diagnosed connective tissue disorder not otherwise specified; though she thinks it's possibly mixed connective tissue disease since I have overlapping things. Have to go see different specialist farther away from home; hoping to get better diagnosis; referred by my primary care physician to this new rhumatologist. I really hope the hour drive up there is worth it; though the appointment won't be for another couple months. Have had joint pain and fatigue for last about 15 years; since I was 18. For awhile; the docs thought it was all in my head; and then they thought lupus; then fibro; then lupus; and then fibro again. Now they think it's a connective tissue disorder because of positive ANA; extremely high SED rate of 60; and other positive tests I can't remember everything my head is so swimming but they think i have other organs involved besides the joints. In meantime; doc is keeping me on Lyrica because it has helped with my joint pain and raynauds syndrome symptoms. And am taking ibuprofin for the inflammation.

1253,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I went to the doctor because my blood pressure stays about 220 / 130 without medication. He prescribed lisinopril. I told him that I preferred a different medication; because sexually active women of reproductive age who are not on birth control are not supposed to take lisinopril. He told me that I was ""being a bit ridiculous"" and said; ""you should trust your doctor."" He refused to prescribe anything else. I have been taking it for two weeks now. My blood pressure is great; but I am having extreme muscle weakness and pain (I find it hard to walk across the room); I have large bruises appearing all over for no apparent reason; and I have developed a blind spot that makes reading difficult.

1254,Lisinopril+hypertension,"For 6 months; I've felt miserable. It began; however; late last year with scintillating scotoma; arm weakness and tingling; tunnel vision; and a feeling that I was going to faint. These episodes would last 20-30 minutes. I was episode-free for awhile; then began to feel terrible with flu-like symptoms 6 months ago. An urgent care nurse practitioner diagnosed me with sinusitis and administered a corticosterioid injection with a round of Clarithromycin antibiotics. For a few days; I felt wonderful and on top of the world. Four days later; I had another episode of wanting to faint. I did not; yet it was everything I could do to steer away from the perceived reality that I was about to die. I literally feared for my life as I counted 1-100 simply to keep my focus. Things went progressively downhill after that episode. I went to the ER that evening with a blood pressure of 150s/115; pulse 125-150. The ER doctor administered a 100mg prescription for Metoprolol. Prior to that; I was only on .88mcgs of Levothyroxine for Hashimoto's Disease; along with 1000mg of concentrated Garlic extract. I had never had excessive hypertension; with an average blood pressure reading of 130s/70s. (Side Note: One year prior; I was having significant heart palpitations; which were checked by a cardiologist via ECG; 24-Hour Holter; Stress Test; etc. The results came back inconclusive for any damage or anything to worry about; other than PVCs and a need for weight loss/exercise.) After being on such a high dose of Metoprolol; within 2 weeks my blood pressure was still higher than before the meds (around 140/90) and the side effects were terrible. They included: dizziness; light-headedness; excessive fear; severe anxiety-like symptoms; feeling of doom; excessive tiredness; weakness; severe muscle twitching; leg swelling; stabbing pains under ribs; headache...and again; I cannot overemphasize the feelings of anxiety; which I interpreted as heart attack or stroke symptoms. They were mind numbing. I was afraid to drive; afraid to stay away from home; afraid to be in public; for fear of something like my own death occurring. To this day; those symptoms exist; to a lesser degree. After about a month on Metoprolol; I found a primary care provider (previously I did not have one); but was only ever given an appointment with a practitioner. Having been in practice only 3 months; they removed me from Metorpolol because of symptoms and a sluggish heartbeat; along with the fact it wasn't doing much for my pressure. It was replaced with Lisinopril; and I was told to followup in 3 months...3 months! I knew I couldn't wait that long. Almost immediately; I switched primary care providers hoping to see a physician. Again; I was assigned a nurse practitioner who lowered the Lisinopril dosage to 2.5mgs and told me I could not be having the symptoms I described; that ""it's in your mind."" Symptoms from the Lisinopril continued; the dizziness became more severe; and the severe ""spurts"" of anxiousness continued. It would feel like an adrenaline rush from the back of my neck; upward to my head; like hot water rushing over me; then I would want to run; literally; because I was worried about passing out or feared death. It was pure fear. Finally; I obtained doctor's permission to discontinue the high blood pressure meds altogether. Within a week; I could time the feelings of anxiety; which began to decrease more and more. The dizziness and most other symptoms subsided; except muscle twitching. For 2 months; I've been without medication; other than Levothyroxine and Garlic. My blood pressure maintains itself at either excellent or prehypertension levels; dependent on work stresses; activity; etc. My current problem is that I still feel sluggish; sometimes slightly anxious to a lesser degree (which I never did before all of this); and now there are continued muscle and neck pains; sometimes to the point of ""am I having a heart attack."" I have also developed something akin to GERD. Not a lot of acid reflux; but stomach pain that can be severe. My thyroid levels; MRIs; pituitary MRI; adrenal levels; chest x-rays; WBC; RBC; ANA; RA Factor; all came back normal. The only thing is; during this period of time; my Sed Rate and CRP levels raised from normal to very high (29 and 13.2 respectively). However; my practitioner; my endocrinologist; and a rheumatologist each say those two results are very ""non-specific."" No further tests have been ordered. Where could all this be coming from? Anxiety? Personally; I don't believe so. Stomach issues? Possibly. Cardiac issues; despite normal testing? Very possibly; I believe; especially since I've been pill free for all this time and still have PVCs that will make me dizzy or cough.

1256,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female,,,I put BP medic januari 2012 I start amlodipin lisinopril lisinopril darn near kill the prescrib doctor would not take I stop take made appoint anoth doctor I take 125 mg metoprolol 10 mg amlodipin 3 month I copd someth aggrav breath problem I went doctor yesterday took metoprolol put 100 mg losartan He told stop take metoprolol I question start high dose losartan I seem sensit medic felt start right 100 mg bit high everyth ive read onlin suggest peopl usual start 50 mg I question stop metoprolol suddenli both question fob I took first dose losartan 630 morn I alway take amlodipin 8 pm due hour A short time ago I suddenli terribl spell I felt like I wasnt go abl get breath go even nebul I felt like BP went ear felt like burn thi spell last 15 minut fast heart rate should losartan step metoprolol left kept rebound effect can anyon comment offer advic If I I would take chanc control high blood pressur natur would put toxic stuff bodi ive done lot research read past six month I read scare I get junk ive feed

1258,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi All; I am a 26 year old male that has been struggling with high blood pressure for over a year now. In that time I began exercising; eating better; and reducing salt from my diet. I've lost around 40 pounds since February of this year. My blood pressure has improved but not by what I was expecting. I used to have blood pressure averaging 135/85 but it ranged from 125/75 to 150/95 at times. Now I am usually around 135 on the systolic number and 80 or below on the diastolic number. I've had good improvement on my diastolic number. However I'm not happy with where my systolic number is. My systolic number is usually 130 to 140. I don't understand why; I eat virtually no salt in my diet. In fact I'm probably not getting enough salt in my diet. I really want to see my systolic number 125 or lower; but even under 130 consistently would be OK. No matter what I do I can't seem to improve my systolic number. I am not on any blood pressure medications. I took Lisinopril for 2 weeks and then went to the ER for heart attack like symptoms. I had the full works of tests done which determined my heart was healthy but did not determine the cause of the symptoms. My doctor took me off Lisinopril and I haven't been taking medications since. What is really confusing is the instability in my blood pressure readings. For example I could take my blood pressure at 130/80 and then 10 minutes later it will be 140/75 with no change in activity or posture. Then another 10 minutes later it might be 125/80. Anyone struggling with something similar or have any advice?

1259,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather ""sloppy"" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms?

Her heart dr. has discontinued the atenolol for her high blood pressure since she is also on revatio (new term for viagra) and he feels this should control her pressure. He also states the atenolol is contributing to her excessive tummy extension and extreme swelling of her feet even though she is on furosemide for water retension. This is the first we have heard of atenolol contributing to water retension. Please give us your opinion.

1262,Lisinopril+hypertension,"im a 43 year old male. have been healthy my entire life. have exercised 3-5 days a week (bicycling) for 20 years. currently way around 186. have never done a single drug in my life; not even smoked pot. never smoked; rarely drank a glass of red wine before; no alcohol at all now (beta-blocker). in march 2010 i crashed on my bike and had my first ever visit to a hospital in my life (well since birth). i ripped open my knee on some gravel and needed to get it sewn back up. upon admitting me in triage; they took my BP and asked if i have high BP. i was like i have no clue. dont even know what is normal or what the numbers even mean. so the sewed me up and sent me on my way and advised that i see my primary doc (i never get sick so it had been 3 years since i'd seen a dr. so i made an appt with a new dr. and told him the ER was concerned with my BP. he prescribed a low dosage of Lisinopril which i began taking immediately. he ordered several blood tests (cholest; etc) and asked me to come back the following week. the Lisinopril began making me feel ill almost immediately and made it impossible for me to sleep so i stopped taking it after the 4th day. the following week; i returned to my dr to go over my test. he looked them over; told me i was as healthy a person as he'd seen and told me to forget about taking the Lisinopril and get back to my normal life as before. that very night; while lying on my sofa watching the Lakers game; and for no apparent reason; the left side of my face went numb. i had purchased a home BP monitor the week before. so after getting up and trying to ""walk it off"" assuming my face had just fallen asleep; i took my BP. it was in the neighborhood of 270/170. knowing this was very bad; i jumped into my car and drove the the hospital 3 miles away. 2 days in ICU; every test known to man (CAT; brain MRI; echo; ekg; every blood test; etc). The diagnosis was that i had a minor TIA and was released and told i have hypertension. before this; i had never even heard of a TIA. to answer the next question; there is not really a family history of hypertension. both parents are now on BP meds; but but are near 70 so that's expected. i was started on Toprol 50mg which i took once a day. i then began seeing a cardiologist. again; endless tests (including stress test) found nothing abnormal. my meds have been changed a bit; i now take Exforge 5/160; which is Norvasc and a water pill in one pill; and for the past 4 months; i've been taking Bystolic 5mg in the evening. i've accepted the fact that i will likely be taking meds for the rest of my life. i've lost around 8 pounds in the past 4 months by changing my diet. i stopped all caffeine way back in April and stopped drinking even red wine once i was put on the beta blocker as im told you cant drink while on one. for the most part; my BP has seemed to be fairly stable and in the ""normal"" range. that said; a couple of times; and for a few days straight; my BP jumps 10-15pts and remains consistently higher for a few days. this happend back in August; and i went to my dr and he told me to just ride it out and see what happens. i did; and it settled back down; even to ""low"" levels of 112/72 (by my standards anyway). then; about 16 days ago; by BP spiked up again. i began feeling like i was getting the flu. my symptoms were dizzyness; slight nausea; slight weakness/lethargy; trouble getting to sleep; and the most baffling; extreme cold flashes; where i can not get warm no matter what i do. last week i had plans to go to hawaii; and decided to go even with these symptoms as i figured i could get better in the heat. i spent 2 decent days there; then on the night of the 7th; i had one of these cold spells that i could not shake. if you cant get warm in hawaii; somethings wrong. after about 1 hour; i ended up going to the ER in Kahuku to see if they could help. but before i left; i took 2 Xanex. they took my BP in the hospital and it was only slightly elevated; no fever; etc. they took some blood and urine samples and did a quick test. the only result they found was slightly elevated white blood cell count. so im not 16 days in and im not getting worse; but only feel slightly better. last night i had another of the freezing episodes; which had me contemplating heading back to the ER; which i did not. i did however; take 2 Xanex; and after about an hour; began warming up and feeling slightly more ""normal"". i did meet with my primary doc on Monday and told him i wanted to be tested for everything that this could possibly be. on Tuesday; they took a few vials of blood to do some tests. however; ive been through this so im not sure how much confidence i have in them finding anything. to say it's frustrating is an understatement. my life has been turned upside down. so; my question. could this really be Anxiety related??? the only reason i ask; is that it seems that the Xanex calms me. im not sure if it's really the Xanex or just the process of the cold flash running it's course. or do all my symptoms add up to something bigger? i honestly dont care if it's something bad; but im the type of person who wants to know. sorry for the long message. any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2010,2010,,,,,im 43 year old male healthi entir life exercis 35 day week bicycl 20 year current way around 186 never done singl drug life even smoke pot never smoke rare drank glass red wine alcohol betablock march 2010 crash bike first ever visit hospit life well sinc birth rip open knee gravel need get sewn back upon admit triag took BP ask high BP like clue dont even know normal number even mean sew sent way advis see primari doc never get sick 3 year sinc id seen dr made appt new dr told ER concern BP prescrib low dosag lisinopril began take immedi order sever blood test cholest etc ask come back follow week lisinopril began make feel ill almost immedi made imposs sleep stop take 4th day follow week return dr go test look told healthi person hed seen told forget take lisinopril get back normal life night lie sofa watch laker game appar reason left side face went numb purchas home BP monitor week get tri walk assum face fallen asleep took BP neighborhood 270170 know bad jump car drove hospit 3 mile away 2 day icu everi test known man cat brain mri echo ekg everi blood test etc the diagnosi minor tia releas told hypertens never even heard tia answer next question realli famili histori hypertens parent BP med near 70 that expect start toprol 50mg took day began see cardiologist endless test includ stress test found noth abnorm med chang bit take exforg 5160 norvasc water pill one pill past 4 month ive take bystol 5mg even ive accept fact like take med rest life ive lost around 8 pound past 4 month chang diet stop caffein way back april stop drink even red wine put beta blocker im told cant drink one part BP seem fairli stabl normal rang said coupl time day straight BP jump 1015pt remain consist higher day happend back august went dr told ride see happen settl back even low level 11272 standard anyway 16 day ago BP spike began feel like get flu symptom dizzy slight nausea slight weaknesslethargi troubl get sleep baffl extrem cold flash get warm matter last week plan go hawaii decid go even symptom figur could get better heat spent 2 decent day night 7th one cold spell could shake cant get warm hawaii someth wrong 1 hour end go ER kahuku see could help left took 2 xanex took BP hospit slightli elev fever etc took blood urin sampl quick test result found slightli elev white blood cell count im 16 day im get wors feel slightli better last night anoth freez episod contempl head back ER howev take 2 xanex hour began warm feel slightli normal meet primari doc monday told want test everyth could possibl tuesday took vial blood test howev ive im sure much confid find anyth say frustrat understat life turn upsid question could realli anxieti relat reason ask seem xanex calm im sure realli xanex process cold flash run cours symptom add someth bigger honestli dont care someth bad im type person want know sorri long messag advic would greatli appreci
1263,Lisinopril+hypertension,"You may not be able to answer this; but I thought I might run it by you. Suppose someone developed exercise intolerance and SOB in May; and noticed at that time they had tachycardia at rest to about 110-120. Finally went to the doc in Aug and had a stress echo that showed post exercise PA pressure of 60. Had a full work up with CT Angiogram; PFT's; sleep study; lots of bloodwork for AI diseases; venous dopplers; everything neg. Suppose this person had been put on Cardizem; and wham! No more shortness of breath; and resting pulse is usually mid 90's; sometimes lower. Good exercise tolerance unless its something really strenuous. Yesterday our fictitious patient had another abbreviated stress echo; where the doc just looked at the pre and post exercise PA pressures and pronounced them normal. Said just to carry on with the Cardizem; that he thinks the person is just intolerant of the tachycardia and that is why the person had the SOB and exercise intolerance. He admittedly does not know why the person developed this tachycardia; and seems disinclined to investigate furthur. Theoretically; the person would be happy to leave this alone; but she does question why a previously healthy active 50 year old nonsmoker would develop resting tachycardia; SOB; and exercise intolerance with elevated post exercise PA pressure in the first place. He just shrugged his shoulders when asked. Something inside me says a person shouldn't have to take a pill simply to be able to walk around the block. Is another opinion in order? Suppose the person had another pulmonologist is equally disinclined to do anything more; and she doesn't want to become one of ""those"" patients who go around insisting there must be something wrong with me.

1267,Lisinopril+hypertension,My blood pressure has two different readings when taken from both arms simultaneously. The difference sometime can defer as much as 10 mmH. For example; from my right arm it reads 140/86; but my left arm reads 150/94 and it has been quite consistantly different between 5-10 mmH. Another question is; I am currently taking COSAAR 50mg to control my Blood pressure and after a couple of months; it seems that the medication has no effect on me. I was wondering whether the 100mg COSAAR is actually twice the 50mg dosage coz I am currently taking 1/2 tablet of 100mg instead of the 50mg tablet; due the cost different.,2009,2009,,Male,,,My blood pressur two differ read taken arm simultan the differ sometim defer much 10 mmh for exampl right arm read 14086 left arm read 15094 quit consistantli differ 510 mmh anoth question I current take cosaar 50mg control blood pressur coupl month seem medic effect I wonder whether 100mg cosaar actual twice 50mg dosag coz I current take 12 tablet 100mg instead 50mg tablet due cost differ
1268,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi guys; My general practitioner and I really don't mesh! I've been going to her for maybe 11 years; I haven't really seen her many times but every time I have RECENTLY; she seems agitated. She yelled at me for filling medication from the ER; even tho I called and asked the staff BEFORE I filled it the next day; I was prescribed Loratab 5 mg; Flexeril 10 mg and Voltaren. When I went into my next appt. I told her I went to the ER and that I had called and the staff told me that if you had a problem with them you would've called. She looked through the report and the medications; asked me what I had filled; I told her the Flexeril and Loratab; I didn't fill the Voltaren because it was 45 dollars. She said ""They didn't have a generic?"" I said ""that was the generic""she said ""there is no way"" and she wrote in my file ""Didn't try this medication""; and she asked ""So; you filled the loratab?"" I said yes and she was obviously angry; I told her that did help more than the Ultram and she yelled ""Well you don't want to be on those the rest of your life!"" I went ahead and filled the Voltaren when I had the funds just to see how it helped; it made me puke so I never took it again. She was once caring; once she couldn't diagnose me; she thought I was full of it. She refused to refill my ativan and once she referred me to the Neuro; she refused to refill ANY of my medicines. She waited until I ran out of medication to tell me she would no longer be filling my prescriptions. I DID take Lisinopril for high blood pressure; I called and said I need a refill of that and she had the Nurse ask me ""The doctor wants to know if you really still need the Lisinopril?"" I said ""Well why wouldn't I? I've been taking it for months; I would assume that if I didn't my blood pressure would go up again; right?"" and she said ""Well check your pharmacy by 5"" which it was never called in. So how do I go about switching doctors? I want to switch before I have to go back to her; how do I switch a doctor without a reason to see a doctor? (i.e. visiting the doctor because of a sickness) What do I do? I have NO experience with this; I just refuse to go back to her; I would rather be horribly sick for weeks than to deal with someone that is really rude to me and doesn't believe me.

1269,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi; I'm 53; male; not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol; until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago). I found the combo effective; regular monitoring showed BP controlled; no side effects. about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy; standing up; and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However; dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril; then stopped another quarter; then completely. Monitored my own BP; went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed. However; my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise; and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion; dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff; which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative; although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work. I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'. I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months; and is it a coincidence that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia; and has done a MRI of my head (still await results). I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling; almost numbness; (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse. I don't think I'm going to keel over; but I just cant understand the chain of events. My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down. Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's; yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose. I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks 'your fine'; but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed. Can high blood pressure resolve like this ? Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ? The neurologist has recommended duloxotine; which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :( Thanks for reading,2014,2014,52.0,Male,,,Hi Im 53 male overweight I diagnos hbp I 28 origin treat atenelol chang doctor switch 30mg coracten 20mg lisinopril 13 year ago I found combo effect regular monitor show BP control side effect 16 month ago I notic I get dizzi stand dizzi exercis I stop coracten doc confirm BP ok without coracten howev dizzi continu I stop half lisinopril stop anoth quarter complet monitor BP went doc confirm ok typic read sit 11776 needless say I delight amaz howev troubl seem start I continu slightli lighthead exercis feel pin needl scalp upper face start I thought may neck I travel lot episod confus dizzi vertigo hotel larg meal I urg eat sweet stuff reliev symptom time sinc test reactiv hypoglycemia neg although I think blood sugar involv coup occas due ongo feel worsen prickl face eye I spent month work I put 24hr BP cuff came back averag normal I dont realli understand high BP 25 year dissapear within matter month coincid new symptom almost coincid last dose lisinopril I neurologist mention dysesthsia done mri head still await result I feel feel wors prickl almost numb like dentist anesthet wear scalp face wors I dont think Im go keel I cant understand chain event My note would HR eat goe bit wild I urg liesit stand without eat systol low 100 yet diastol seem stabl 80 normal limit I suppos I feel weird I exercis regularli My doc think fine I dont feel I neither anxiou depress can high blood pressur resolv like could BP medic caus kind perman withdraw caus symptom the neurologist recommend duloxotin I hope avoid I dont seem get anywher thank read
1270,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Several weeks ago I developed a ""thumping"" in my left ear that occurs most often at night when I wake up from sleep during the night. It occurs more often if I am sleeping on my left side. The thumping occurs in patterns of two and can repeat several times before ending. During the day it may occur once; twice; or not at all. I believe that this is caused by a muscular contraction either in the middle ear or the throat. Sometimes yawing can bring it on; other times not. I had a middle ear infection which cleared up prior to this. My ent put me on Nasacort AQ which I have discontined. Additionally; I have begun weaning myself off Klonopin (a benzo) when this whole thing began. Are the two possibly related? If not what is the cause? I have seen my cardiologist and had a dopler study of my carotids which proved to be negative. I do not have hypertension.

1271,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I posted this for the doc; but did not get the answers I had hoped for...perhaps my expectations were too high. I am so depressed so I thought I would try the forum here. Some history; I am 33 year old male; 6'4"" and 238 pounds. I have had 2 ablations for AVNRT SVT tachycardia last year; May and July at UPMC. After the second procedure I developed a PE. I was on warfarin for 6 months and then in Jan 07 I stopped warfarin. At the same time; due to daily aspirin and severe anxiety from heart issues; I developed gastric and duodenal ulcers. I went on protonix and was fine in a few weeks. In October 06 I had more abdominal symptoms; had upper GI to reveal small ulcer. I took more protonix and was ok again. I was put on Klonopin for anxiety around that time as well. I also have PVCs; but cardiologist says heart is fine otherwise. Had gastric emptying study which was normal. Had ultrasound for gall bladder/pancreas which was unremarkable. In late December; early January I started having headaches all day and dizziness blurry vision at the end of the day also. I started noticing a sore neck. Neurologist gave me gabopentin which I am unsure if it helps. In the last couple weeks I have started having terrible abdominal pain and chest pressure after eating. The pain/pressure is mainly at the center of my chest. The dizziness; neck pain; etc.. are worse also. I belch alot and it feels like there is a brick where my stomach should be. I had another upper GI today that showed no problems...other than a small hiatal hernia all is healed. I have PVCs in bunches after I eat; along with extreme fluctuations in my heart rate/force of beat etc...Also I did have the upper endo twice; one this week and they found nothing.

1272,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have high blood pressure. One year ago I was put on Accupril. Three months later I was switched to Lisinopril due to an insurance change. In May of '99 while driving to work; my heart began beating very hard. I could hear it beating in my head and it felt as if it could beat out of my chest. It was followed by two brief black-outs. Fortunately I made it to the side of the road without hurting anyone. I felt nauseated and had a very dry mouth. At the ER they gave me an EKG and a brain scan. When they determined nothing was seriously wrong with me they let me go. My doctor had me quit taking high blood pressure medication for awhile and see how I did. I was off of them for about 6 months when I started getting blood pressure headaches again. He then put me on 25 mg of Atenolol. I found immediate relief in headaches and my blood pressure went down. Two days ago while sitting at my desk at work; the heart started its hard beating again and I felt as if I could black out; but I did not. I stood up and walked for a minute and it went away. Neither episode occured during a stressful situation. Two doctors have told me that nothing can be done and that we can't know what it is unless we catch it while its happening. My fear is that I could black out again while driving and hurt not only myself but someone else. Has anyone heard anything like this? If so; what could be the problem? My doctor said the irregular rythms are normal; but he really didn't have an answer for the blacking out. I thought maybe my blood pressure was going to low; but he said no. I would appreciate any advice I could get.

Not libido; but maintaining a firm erection. I went off Zocor; and Dyazide 3 months ago for financial reasons and the problem went away. I have started to take the Dyzazide againg and the problem seems to be starting again. It appears the problem is therefore Dyazide related. I am going to see my doctor in a couple of weeks and am trying to be informed before I see him.

1275,Lisinopril+hypertension,Could you please elaborate on blood pressure fluctuations. 37 y/o m; overweight; but losing. 2 a-fibs 2 years ago; none sense. BP has been hard to regulate. Meds are: Zoloft (25); Cardizem LA (180); Lisinopril (0;10;20- This is where we adjust most); & HCTZ (25). When all this began a couple years ago; I had all the test to rule out secondary hypertension. The problem is I seem to be having trouble getting the BP regulated. I know fluctuations are normal; but frustratingly; mine will go to high; we adjust; then too low; adjust; and so on. Cardio and GP have been wonderful to work with. Interestingly; losing weight so far has not helped BP (40# so far). I realize there is no magic # where weight loss helps; but??? What other factors should I possibly consider with BP changes. No fried stuff; minimal salt intake; and relatively no caffeine for a couple years now. Also non-smoker. It is not unbearable; but very aggravating. It would definitely be worse if the 2 Dr.'s were not working together or with me as they have been. I guess my question is what else can I do to get this a little more stable; and; how wide a variation in BP is acceptable before something else could be causing it? By the way; I feel fine when my BP is say 140's/90's. How do you determine what is the BP that is ideal for you as an individual? The standards are set for a reason; but are they applicable to everyone or not? Like how lower BP is fine for some but not others?

Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) Daily BP: B4 breakfast - 140 PM & eve- 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

1277,Lisinopril+hypertension,A month ago I did a health screen; which I do every year for Hypertension and never received a call regarding the lab results. I came in for a refill on my high blood pressure meds. Mind you this place has 5 different doctors. One Doctor I’ve never met came into the room and looks at me like he’s got some really really bad news. He shuts the door and says I hate to ruin your weekend but I have to tell you this and I’m looking confused and he says; you’re cbc looks like you have HIV and I said well how could that be and he lets me see it and I said that’s been my count for almost 4 years; you should have that in your file and he says we may have lost past results. I told that I have Herpes from when I was molested at 12 years old and I am now 34; I haven’t had sex in ten years do to depression and I was tested regularly up until last year. I just did a health screen with my GYN which the test is very similar that everything was fine. So he says well maybe it’s because you’re African American; maybe it’s nothing; plus everything else is normal; maybe you should still see a hematologist to be safe; don’t worry. I have not slept or eaten; I am just in a shock I can’t imagine to detail. Then he calls me back the next day and apologizes saying that he was thinking about our conversation all yesterday and did some research Lisinopril a high blood pressure pill can cause this disorder as well as the fact that I take depression pills; stress; and have HSV2 and 1; he said don’t rush though it’s not an emergency.

1279,Lisinopril+hypertension,Back in December I felt a tightness in my chest and went to the doctor thinking I had a cold coming on. During the visit the doctor found my pulse to be fast (120). She sent me for an ECG which showed my pulse to be normal. They than sent me for a stress test and once again my pulse was high; but everything else was fine. The put me on beta blockers at this point to slow the rate of my heart and set up an echo. The echo showed my EF to be 35%. They have no idea what is causing my EF to be so low. I am a 26 year old female; fairly active; non-smoker; I drink a few times a year; normal cholestoral; not diabetic; slim build; low-normal blood pressure. I met with another doctor who has since put me on a second drug for hypertension. Both drugs low my blood pressure which is already boardline low. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I can expect or be doing now. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've been sort of stressing out about all of this as until Decemeber I considered myself to be a very healthy person.

Second; could the low hemoglobin and symptoms of anemia (fatigue; cold hands/feet; weakness; palpitations) be related to the low GFR and kidneys. (Iron deficiency anemia seems to be ruled out since I have hemochromatosis and my iron overload should prevent that along with all tests to check for any bleeding have come back negative.)

1282,Lisinopril+hypertension,"After 13 years of struggling with pains did I find a fix in my kitchen? HISTORY: I've had seasonal type pains with spasms shooting threw my whole body; neck and shoulder pains (sometimes go numb); and some areas of my body that heats up like a sunburn. Fibro didn't fit though because I didn't have the soft points hurt. The cold weather or fluctuations in the temperature seems to make the pains worse. The last few weeks/months being ""really bad""; not even being able to sit or stand for more than a hour at a time due to lower back and hip pains......Out of desperation; I think I found the cure. After reading and re reading tons of articles I saw salt cravings so I looked up SODIUM DEFICIENCY. As crazy as it sounds; I made a bowl of oodles of noodles. Added a bunch of celery salt; onion salt; garlic salt; 2 extra bullion cubes; and table salt to it. I ate it and also drank some pickle juice afterwards. MY PAINS WERE ALL ALMOST GONE WITHIN A 1/2 to a HOUR!!!!!!!! I'm going to call my Dr. and find out why or how this could be? I know with all of my BP/HR issues this was crazy to try; but; I was desperate for anything to work. Where I live the doctors don't give out pain meds and haven't for the last couple years. I'm just amazed that this SALT worked better for me than any pill could. Good for me that my heart cath turned out good last year. YIPPIE......HaPpY HaPpY JoY JoY. Doing the dance!!!!! Though not heart healthy. I do take: blood pressure meds (Triamterene/HCTZ; Metoprolol; Lisinopril; vit. E; aspirin) hypothyroid pill (Levothyroxine) cholesteral pill (Atorvastatin) Co-Enzyme Q-10 For pain. (Etodolac) plus Vit D - 5000IU IBS (Dicyclomine as needed) Any ideas on why the salt helped me please? I've had these pains for so many years. P.S. I have all of my paperwork w/bld results.

1285,Lisinopril+hypertension,I get pain in my chest that feels like a racketball is stuck in there; when I belch; it feels like it has deflated; but it will reinflate. I had a full cardiac workup and endoscopy one year ago when this issue first arose; and both were normal. A double dose of Nexium and a normal dose of Singulair eventually seemed to cure it. But it now has come back a year later; and after a week of doubling the Nexium and two days of adding Singulair; it has not gone away. Any thoughts? Wondered if it might be seasonal; given the January onset with colder weather each time.

1286,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am 48 yr old male with Juvenile onset Diabetis. About 6 months ago I had a brief spell of a-fib that caused a chain reaction of doctor visits; cariologist visits; tests that all came out normal. My cardiologist put me on metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice per day. Although he told me it was a benign drug I have many side effects including fatigue and drowsiness; some dizzyness; and loss of sex drive and ED problems. The side effects were really hampering my ability to function throughout the day. About 3 weeks ago i tapered off metoprolol of which my last dose was 1 1/2 weeks ago. everything went fine but now am having issues with blood pressure spikes; chest pains. tachy-cardia spells and dizzyness. I really feel crummy. My thinking was that I was having withdrawls from not taking metoprolol but why the symptoms after almost two weeks from taking it? I am tempted to go back on the drug to alleviate these symptoms as they are kind scary. I do not want to be on this drug and feel there is no need for it. I have mild hypertension and proir to metoprolol was taking low dose of lisinopril which I am back on now.,2013,2013,,Male,,,hello I 48 yr old male juvenil onset diabeti about 6 month ago I brief spell afib caus chain reaction doctor visit cariologist visit test came normal My cardiologist put metoprolol tartrat 25mg twice per day although told benign drug I mani side effect includ fatigu drowsi dizzy loss sex drive ED problem the side effect realli hamper abil function throughout day about 3 week ago taper metoprolol last dose 1 12 week ago everyth went fine issu blood pressur spike chest pain tachycardia spell dizzy I realli feel crummi My think I withdrawl take metoprolol symptom almost two week take I tempt go back drug allevi symptom kind scari I want drug feel need I mild hypertens proir metoprolol take low dose lisinopril I back

1289,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am 36 yr old female w/ history of hypertension; hypothyroid; DVT & PE (3 yrs ago). I am overweight and have been trying to lose; but so far have had little success.

Findings showed left side enlarged; MD had nurse phone to tell me & to continue Lisinopril & Metoprolol & lose weight w/ follow-up echo in 1 yr.

1290,Lisinopril+hypertension,In Nov of 08 I found myself in emergency room 3 times due to headaches; chest pain and the feeling of passing out.. At that time my BP was 200/95... I've had EKGs; CScans w contrast; chest xrays; MRI of brain; lumbar puncture; Halter Monitor in last 1 1/2 yrs... They first diagnosed me w Migrains which the meds made me worse and useless.. Next diagnosis was and still is anxiety.. They first put me on clonazapam and lexapro. I was on that for about 3 mths.. I ran out of clonazapam and they would not refill w/o a visit and had a nasty withdrawal.. I decided to taper off both to get myself clear of all meds.. Took about a month.. After off meds I still had occassional chest pain and headaches going up the left side of my shoulder and neck to left side head.. I purchased a BP machine to monitor it regularly and to show doc on my next visit.. The majority were 140+ over 85+.. While at docs I showed him my findings and told him I thought I had anxiety combined w hypertension.. I am 40 yrs old and had my first child the month in 08 I visited the ER.. Two mths prior the economy crashed... June 08 I put my dog of 11 yrs to sleep... April 08 I found out I was having a child.. Lastly 3/08 I witnessed one of my employees die; right in front of me and 20 other staff; tragically from a car hitting her during a charity event.. High BP runs in my dads side of fam.. Both Grandparents died from stroke.. Dad; bro and aunt are all on BP meds... My doc now has me on .5 Xanax as needed and 10 mg lisinopril.. My BP is now 120+/65+ but these chest pains and tension headaches and fatigue persist.. Which the Xanax does make feel better... My question to you is: Do you see any other possible diagnosis??? Could there be a thyroid issue??? Should I get a second opinion??? I just want the headaches; chest pain and fatigue to go away.. I am now taking an avg of two Xanax a day and don't want to get hooked.... I forgot to mention I own a restaurant w 70 employees and am constantly in high stress situations...

1293,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post.

1295,Lisinopril+hypertension,My son is five-years-old and; barring a miracle; is about to be diagnosed with MPGN. Doctors had entertained a diagnosis of PSGN; but he is 13 weeks post-strep with a C3 compliment of 15. It hasn't moved in 13 weeks. Today I am waiting on results from blood drawn ten days ago for C3 nephritic factor and C1Q. At this point; we're praying that his results don't favor a Type II MPGN diagnosis because the prognosis is much more grim. After the results of this test; I guess the doctors will probably move forward with a biopsy. Is there anyone out there who has gone through this before? I am so emotionally overwhelmed with the waiting; and the lack of answers. Any help is appreciated.

1296,Lisinopril+hypertension,What can cause a moderately enlarged heart; but normal ejection fraction. I also have almost normal Pulmonary Artery Pressure at 20.48. I did have large PE's six years ago; but they have since cleared out. I have high blood pressure spells when standing; normal BP when sitting. I get fast heartbeat sometimes also. I can get a heart rate of 130 BPM just from grating cheese. I am on BP meds to control the high BP when standing. Without meds; my BP can go from 116/78 when sitting to 170/120 just from standing up and walking around. The ER doc said it could be a heart issue causing this and send me for the Echo. The Cardiologist will not even take into consideration my high BP when standing as he says you can only get low blood pressure from standing; not high. My PCP is also stumped and called it liable hypertension. Even with 20-50 mgs of Lisinopril and .2 mgs of Clonidine; my BP will still jump to 130/95 when standing. I have caught my heart rate dropping to the 40's before and also sometimes my oxygen levels drop when walking or doing work. They quickly bounce back up again though. I failed a lung function test two years ago. I had low FEV1/FVC and low DLCO gas exchange. It showed both a restrictive and obstructive pattern; but my HRCT scan of lungs showed normal looking lungs. I also had my oxygen drip to 91 during a 6MWT on the pulmonary doc's 02 meter. So; I know it's not just a fluke with my meter. What do you think this can be from? Also; can taking Lisinopril and Clonidine cause my Pulmonary Artery Pressures to be lower? I have never felt the same since large PE's. I had a VQ scan to rule out chronic clots in the lungs and it came back normal. Can there be gas exchange problems in the lungs that do not show up as ventilation and profusion defects on a VQ scan? I feel tired all of the time. More tired than these issues should make me feel. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a hypochondriac and should just ignore all of this stuff.,2018,2018,,,,,what caus moder enlarg heart normal eject fraction I also almost normal pulmonari arteri pressur 2048 I larg pe six year ago sinc clear I high blood pressur spell stand normal BP sit I get fast heartbeat sometim also I get heart rate 130 bpm grate chees I BP med control high BP stand without med BP go 11678 sit 170120 stand walk around the ER doc said could heart issu caus send echo the cardiologist even take consider high BP stand say get low blood pressur stand high My pcp also stump call liabl hypertens even 2050 mg lisinopril 2 mg clonidin BP still jump 13095 stand I caught heart rate drop 40 also sometim oxygen level drop walk work they quickli bounc back though I fail lung function test two year ago I low fev1fvc low dlco ga exchang It show restrict obstruct pattern hrct scan lung show normal look lung I also oxygen drip 91 6mwt pulmonari doc 02 meter So I know fluke meter what think also take lisinopril clonidin caus pulmonari arteri pressur lower I never felt sinc larg pe I VQ scan rule chronic clot lung came back normal can ga exchang problem lung show ventil profus defect VQ scan I feel tire time more tire issu make feel sometim I wonder Im hypochondriac ignor stuff
1297,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; thanks for taking time to read my post god bless and happy holidays! First I'll quickly introduce myself as a Male; 22yrs old; normal weight; 6'2; rather heathy lifestyle besides my diet I'll cheat sometimes. Non smoker or drinker. 8 months ago I was diagnosed with hypertension which was a shock given my physical history playing sports all my child hood and through High school. I then got an EKG which showed some thickness so we had an echocardiogram set up; which went in to show mild (LVH). My cardiologist told me of this and I was; scared confused; so I came home googled and found it was very serious. I am now on losartan 100mg/hctz 25mg; and at night I take spironolacone 25mg. My blood pressure runs anywhere from 135/80-148/92 on the meds. I cannot use a beta blocker; because late evening my resting Heart Rate gets to low 50's. But during the day runs anywhere from 80-60 resting. Typically get 80 more often after a full meal. My body's been unresponsive to the meds I've tried so far HCTZ; LOSARTAN; DIURETICS; AMLODAPINE; (can't use beta blockers) Alpha blocker (alone) made my heart rate stay above the 100s anytime I'd move it's feel like my hearts pounding out of my chest. Main concern is what am I to do when the doctor is running out of meds to try; my Bp still stays elevated; and I'm needing to keep it low because of LVH I have.... I eat a good diet; I get at least 30 mins treadmill a day; I try breathing yoga...nothing's helping :( he's suggested sending me to a hypertension specialist but I don't have money....anything I can try? I've been through a lot of tests for secondary causes all were normal. I'm hoping someone can give me some advice; I really feel like my life is being shortened everyday from this since I can't control my Bp....I'm young and work so hard to be healthy..why is this happening?,2013,2013,21.0,Male,,,hello thank take time read post god bless happi holiday first ill quickli introduc male 22yr old normal weight 62 rather heathi lifestyl besid diet ill cheat sometim non smoker drinker 8 month ago I diagnos hypertens shock given physic histori play sport child hood high school I got ekg show thick echocardiogram set went show mild lvh My cardiologist told I scare confus I came home googl found seriou I losartan 100mghctz 25mg night I take spironolacon 25mg My blood pressur run anywher 1358014892 med I use beta blocker late even rest heart rate get low 50 but day run anywher 8060 rest typic get 80 often full meal My bodi unrespons med ive tri far hctz losartan diuret amlodapin cant use beta blocker alpha blocker alon made heart rate stay 100 anytim Id move feel like heart pound chest main concern I doctor run med tri Bp still stay elev Im need keep low lvh I I eat good diet I get least 30 min treadmil day I tri breath yoganoth help he suggest send hypertens specialist I dont moneyanyth I tri ive lot test secondari caus normal Im hope someon give advic I realli feel like life shorten everyday sinc I cant control bpim young work hard healthywhi happen
1298,Lisinopril+hypertension,I took a routine physical exam that included a stress test. Though EKG remained normal and I felt fine; at 13 minutes the tech said that she would stop the test because my BP was 258/78. Like an idiot; I said that my HR (158) had leveled off and perhaps I could finish the stage. 30 seconds later; BP was 271/76 (HR 159) and the test was halted. Luckily; I did not have a stroke. Six weeks later; I took a stress echo; both as follow-up on my CAD and to check for a hypertensive response. At 16 minutes; my HR of 166 had not changed for 60 seconds; and the test was getting to be not fun; so I asked to stop. Surprisingly; maximum SBP was only 176 (no change in meds). EKG and echo were normal; and I felt no pain. I would greatly appreciate it if you could please answer a few questions: Should my exercise BP be investigated further? Had I run to the point of exhaustion; would the test have been more sensitive? Would there have been a significant risk? On a stress echo a year ago (a month after a stent was placed); max HR was 176. Should I be concerned that my max HR has apparently fallen 10 BPM in just one year? Some background that may be relevant: I’m male; 62; 5’6”; 135 lb.; strong family history of heart disease; never smoked; lifelong physically active; healthy diet. I have never had any heart disease symptoms; but a screening stress test in Jan. 2007 showed 3.7 mm ST depression. A coronary CT scan was also positive; so I underwent angiography. There was 90% blockage mid RCA; a stent was placed. Severe stenosis also found at several points in circumflex; to be managed medically. I’m taking daily: HCTZ 12.5 mg; lisinopril 10 mg; Zetia 10 mg; Lipitor 40 mg; aspirin 81 mg. With these meds; BP at rest is consistently normal; last test showed LDL-C 59; HDL-C 69; TG 60. Unmedicated (and with poor diet); my SBP was typically 130-140; cholesterol as high as 315.

1299,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi Ken Keith; I remember you from another board and you were always willing to help others. I know you have been through a lot so you certainly have the experience to offer help First ?? I have is my b/p is high at the drs. but fine at home. I finally agreed to take 5 mgs of lisinopril; my last visit my b/p was 201/77 came down to 190/70 the 2 nd check; but the dr. wanted me to take 25 mgs of metrolpo before going to bed. We went grocery shopping; came home and put the grocery away; sat down took my b/p; no resting time and it was 118/58; I retook it before going to bed and it was 105/55. this is about normal for me. Needless to say I did not take the metropolo . I was afraid my b/p would drop too low plus i have bradycardia. I realize this b/p at the dr. was high but she really harps about b/p measurements and i am getting paranoid having it taken there. it use to run about 160-170/90 in the office.. I had a c-scan without dye done before having a hysterectomy; the report states atherosclerotic calcification in the iliac and aorta; i was not told this I read it on the report. there is no mention of calcium score and my G/P said if it was significant changes the report would say so and this is common finding. I am a 69 year old female. Ten months ago I decided it was time to quit smoking and I did but I have gained 20 pounds so I am walking a mile weather permitting and up a hill; no sob or chest pain and my legs were achy when I first started walking but now are fine I don't know whether to see a cardio or not with this b/p and the artherosclertic.I had seen a cardio for a check up; a ekg and echo before surgery and he cleared me for the surgery. my b/p was elevated there but he said if it is okay at home don't worry about it. I did have my b/p monitor compared with my drs. and it was fine. Any advice would be appreciated.

1300,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; I was officially diagnosed with hypothyroid about 18 months ago but couldn't tolerate the natural dessicated meds (Armour). I found out about 6 1/2 months ago the reason I couldn't handle the thyroid meds was due to severe adrenal fatigue: I had very low aldosterone and very low cortisol levels (24-hour saliva test results from 6 1/2 months ago.) Of course I had high blood pressure for about 5 yers prior to this; and had been in an ACE inhibitor for 15 months. (ACE inhibitor Lisinopril---reduces aldosterone levels and spares potassium and causes body to expel sodium.) When I found out that I had low aldosterone and no longer had hypertension 6+ months ago; I quit the Lisinopril. I then followed an adrenal fatigue protocol---which included using celtic sea salt.This worked fine until 3 1/2 months ago when I began to take florinef. I discontinues the florinef after maybe 4-5 weeks becaise it made me temporarily salt sensitive and edematous while on the florinef. I was then fine without florinef and extra sea salt. But the past 2-3 weeks I seem to be fluid retentive all the time---like I am right back to having high aldosterone again. Eating high potassium foods helps for a few hours or so; then the ""puffiness"" comes right back. My fingers/hands/ feet go through so much up-and-down with the fluid retention and then no fluid retention I'm starting to feel like an accordion! The only lasting relief now (relief from chronic fluid fluctuations throughout the day/evening) is I took one of my left over Lisinopril tabs yesterday. I finally lost all puffiness...until it was time to take another lisinopril. I will be starting on Naturethroid shortly---since my adrenal fatiuge is now under control. Is there some kind of direct correlation between untreated hypothyroidism (mine has been pretty much untreated for years) and high or fluctuating aldosterone levels? How can a person have low cortisol levels (which I am being treated for with low dose Rx hydrocortisone) and high aldosterone levels? I know that hypo-t can cause edema. Low corts and high aldosterone---is that due to being long-term hypothyroid? I am also post-menopausal and have been on super low dose hrt. this chronic fluid fluctuation situation has me concerned. Any input would be welcome; Thanks",2009,2009,,Female,,,Hi I offici diagnos hypothyroid 18 month ago couldnt toler natur dessic med armour I found 6 12 month ago reason I couldnt handl thyroid med due sever adren fatigu I low aldosteron low cortisol level 24hour saliva test result 6 12 month ago Of cours I high blood pressur 5 yer prior ace inhibitor 15 month ace inhibitor lisinoprilreduc aldosteron level spare potassium caus bodi expel sodium when I found I low aldosteron longer hypertens 6 month ago I quit lisinopril I follow adren fatigu protocolwhich includ use celtic sea saltthi work fine 3 12 month ago I began take florinef I discontinu florinef mayb 45 week becais made temporarili salt sensit edemat florinef I fine without florinef extra sea salt but past 23 week I seem fluid retent timelik I right back high aldosteron eat high potassium food help hour puffi come right back My fingershand feet go much upanddown fluid retent fluid retent Im start feel like accordion the last relief relief chronic fluid fluctuat throughout dayeven I took one left lisinopril tab yesterday I final lost puffinessuntil time take anoth lisinopril I start naturethroid shortlysinc adren fatiug control Is kind direct correl untreat hypothyroid mine pretti much untreat year high fluctuat aldosteron level how person low cortisol level I treat low dose Rx hydrocortison high aldosteron level I know hypot caus edema low cort high aldosteronei due longterm hypothyroid I also postmenopaus super low dose hrt chronic fluid fluctuat situat concern ani input would welcom thank

1303,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; doc.Thank you for your valuable time. I'm 38; non-smoker. Two years ago; I had undiagnosed asthma during my third pregnancy. (I'm a former runner who was reduced to bedrest at that time). Postpartum; I was diagnosed with ""mild obstructive ventilatory defect w/ improvement after bronchodilators;"" and prescribed Advair 100/50 x2 daily. I've had chronic left-sided chest pain since the pregnancy; and was diagnosed w/ ""endothelial dysfunction;"" per a cardiac provocation cath. I'm taking Lisinopril and Inspra daily; and nitro rarely as needed. A recent echo revealed that the right side of my heart is mildly dilated. (We're all hoping that a year from now; the results will be different). Below is my most recent PFT for your interpretation and recommendations; if any.

1304,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 50 y/o female that has been c/o fatigue; been more extreme since recent bout with viral gastroenteritis. I experienced some SOB and significant edema. Seen by a physician who ran some labwork which came back within normal limits; BNP was 253; she did give me lasix for a couple days for which I dropped 14.5 pounds in 2 days. She also ordered a cardiac echo and stress test for me. Echo showed some regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valve but nothing to warrant further treatment and left atrium dilation; and I believe left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevation...again; told nothing to be concerned with. I've had episodes in the past where my heart rate has dropped down to the upper 30's and then would come back up to 50-60 range. I would say my normal resting HR has always been around 80. So; since they labwork was good; the cardiac tests were fine; my PMD said my fatigue has to be my depression. I personally don't think so but hey; I'll go with it for now. I'm faithfully going to the gym and working out for 1-2 hours 4 days (or more) a week. I work hard while I am there; riding bike for an hour; getting my HR from 130-150+. During that hour though I will see my HR drop down to 60's and then down to the 40's. It will stay there for maybe 3-5 minutes and slowly climb to 70 and then wham; I'm back up to the 130's again. To me this does not seem normal. I'm thinking this may be the reason for my fatigue with the HR fluctuating as it does and not my depression. They have resorted to giving me ritalin to take daily now just so I can function; I hate taking it but if I don't; I certainly wouldn't get anything done. Am I off in thinking that 45 minutes into biking hard and my HR is running in the 40's? I know nothing showed up in the 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill but I can't believe that captured the entire situation. I am on no medications to cause lowering of the heart rate. I do take lisinopril for my blood pressure but no beta blockers or others that would contribute to this. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Would you think a holter monitor be an appropriate thing? If so; how do you get your PMD to do this when they are set on it being depression because nothing shows up in the labwork & the cardiac tests?

1306,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?)

1307,Lisinopril+hypertension,Thank you in advance for your help. First I'll give a quick history: I'm a 37;male; 6'; 220lbs.; caucasian 1. Open heart at age 4 for ASD 2. Two Catheter Ablations for A-tach. Both were unsuccessful and left me with a pacemaker because I went in to complete heart block. 3. Open heart surgery at age 35 for Sinus Venosus Defect. 4. Maze Procedure performed during last open heart surgery. Successful; no A-tachs since. 4. Left Atrium measures 5cm 5. Moderate mitral valve regurgitation 6. Dilated Coronary Sinus 7. Current medications: 325mg of Aspirin daily; 5mg Lusinopril 8. Avg. BP 130/82 So here's the big question; at my last pace check; 2 episodes of A-fib were found. One lasted only 4 heart beats and the other lasted 30 seconds. One was in Jan.08 and the other in May of 08. My Ep Dr. has recommended I start Coumadin due to the A-fibs. I wore a monitor for 21 days and nothing registered. Although; I'm usually a very good patient; Coumadin seems like an overkill for only 2 very small episodes. What do you think? How long does Afib have to last in order to cause a stroke? Would it be unwise for me to take a wait and see approach? I thought maybe I can get a pace check every 3 months and see if the Afibs become more regular? I'm very active with two young children. Although I do not want to suffer from a stroke; I wonder if Coumadin is the best option for me. I should also mention that I am asymptomatic. I never even felt my A-tachs either.

1313,Lisinopril+hypertension,So basically since the end of October ish; I’ve had some strange chest discomfort. At the time I had recently been put on lisinopril for somewhat high BP; however I got the pesky cough that came with it and a butload of nausea so I asked the doctor if I could try a more natural approach instead of getting on medicine right away; my BP is pre hypertension; but I’m overweight and planned on changing that. So after only a month on lisinopril I dropped it. The chest discomfort persist. I’ve been to the doctors and had an EKG(thinking it was my heart)which was normal. A few times I went to the ER with stab-like chest pains lasting mere seconds but kept happening; both times they did a full cariac workup (X-ray; blood tests; ekg) and both times; normal. Most days I wake up - I feel this void or sinking feeling in my lower chest/upper abdomen area; and kinda on the left side. I’m very tired nowadays as well. Almost every day once my day starts(usually picks up at around 10-11) I have a tension-like headache that lasts pretty much all day. My chest feels weird sometimes like my heart isn’t pumping that great? Idk. I have this constant urge to check my pulse a lot; and 99% of the time it’s a normal Pulse.. the other 1% I’m usually having PVC/PAC. Yeah; I get those sometimes. Most of the time it’s just one; but I’ve had a handful of times where there’s been a string of them; like normal beat; pvc;normal beat; pvc normal beat pvc and this goes on like 5-7 PVC’s and goes back to normal. My doctor said PVC’s are usually benign; but my whole life I’ve never experienced Them although I’m sure I’ve had them because normal people have them everyday but I’ve never felt them like I do now; if that makes since? Sometimes while sitting down; my heart rate hits the upper 90s or as high as 110; When I’m laying down it’s low 60s; but it can hit upper 80s and I’ve also noticed my heart slows WAY down when I exhale. During activities such as sex or masturabtion - I SOMETIMES have what feels like a slow; powerful beating heart. It usually feels uncomfortable; and I end up stopping. Also recently; I have noticed unusual bowl movements. They’re mostly normal in size/color for the most part but I see a lot more undgiested food in my stool that I’ve never seen before and Ive seen mucus on my stool/toilet paper the first time in my life not to long ago; it’s happened a couple times now. And it seems that whatever I eat nowadays; will exit me in about 5-8 hours. I know this because some of it is undigested. Anyways; all of this has given me anxiety. I’m a horrible googler of symptoms and that makes it so much worse. So much so that it was effecting my life and the people around me so my doctor prescribed me anti depression/anxiety Paxil 20mg. I take one every day at about 8:30 p.m. and I’ve been on it for a month now. Now I wake up; same old feeling in my chest. Go to work; usually do pretty good the whole day; aside from that constant chest discomfort that I feel like I’m just getting used to now... but at the end of the day; I get home get comfy; at about 6:30-7 I start to get a loopy feeling in my head and slight dizziness; sometimes I feel nauseas; and have blurred vision and sometimes when I focus hard on something small my eyes will jerk. This has been going on for about 15 days. I’m not exerting myself in anyway. I usually just play video games or watch a movie or play a mobile game just chilling laying down or something; yet I still feel weird in my head. I’ve been told this could be a side effect of Paxil though; but idk. Some days; even during work I feel extremely dizzy; and sick like I’m on the verge of passing out kind of feeling; but that’s only happened a few times. Anyways; I’m so sick of feeling this way. I have no idea what it could be.

1314,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello; I am a 37 y/o male. I have been an ICU nurse for 8 years and have a pretty knowledge base of cardiac medicine and have a good amount of common sense. I have had PVC's for 3 years now in the range of 14000-18000 per day. 14% or so of all heartbeats. I recently had an echo because they were getting worse and I was diagnosed with Grade I diastolic dysfunction. I sense that this is becoming more common in younger people because cardiologists are now looking for DD on echos. I have in the past 6 months developed hypertension from SBP 120-130 now 130-150 and DBP 65-80 now in the 85-95 range. I feel the PVCs and DD are related although there doesn't seem much evidence to suggest this. I have decided to start Flecainide 100 mg BID for the PVCs (after Bystolic; Inderal LA; and Verapimil did nothing for PVCs). The EP started me on Lisinopril 5 mg daily and I can increase that to 10 daily if SBP > 140. My biggest question is what are the chances of the grade I DD progressing? My cardio says ""not much"" but I'm not for sure what to make of that. Neither him nor the EP seem very excited about it. I am from the standpoint my symptoms have all occured in the past 3 years and my BP in the past 6 months. I do have a high lipid profile for which I have changed my diet; don't smoke; red rice yeast 1200 mg daily; niacin 500 daily and will get a lipid profile and liver function tests in 6 weeks or so. Thats about it. I don't feel I need an ablation at this time it seems a bit drastic. What is your opinion of Flecainide; BP control and medications I should be on and the longterm prognosis if I can control my BP?

1315,Lisinopril+hypertension,I will not be seeing a neuro dr until May 8th and I feel as though I am losing it. I am on my 4th week of not feeling well. Numbness; tingling; joint aches; muscle weakness. I am tired but my the overwhelming fatigue has gone. By the time evening rolls around I have worked myself into a frenzy of crying; being sad and thinking that all I wish was I knew what was wrong with me and praying that I wake up tomorrow feeling normal. I have had a mri on the brain that showed multiple white lesion and with my symptons my regular dr is leaning toward MS. Would ms symptons come on this strong and last this long? before this episode I never really had any problems. I am scared that if this isn't ms what is it then.... I know that more then likely when I see the neuro he probably won't be able to tell me a whole lot. how do I overcome these depressing feelings? Also has anyone ever heard of being on a medication for a few years and then all of a sudden begin to have side effects from the drug? Reason I am asking is I have been taking lisinopril for high blood pressure for 2 years now. I found a site about side effects of medications and when I looked at lisinopril there were many people on there writing about side effects that they are having being on that drug and their symptons are alot like the ones I am having right now with the tingling and so on. Am I grasping at straws thinking it could be my meds? Any thoughts would be appreciated.,2009,2009,52.0,Female,,,I see neuro dr may 8th I feel though I lose I 4th week feel well numb tingl joint ach muscl weak I tire overwhelm fatigu gone By time even roll around I work frenzi cri sad think I wish I knew wrong pray I wake tomorrow feel normal I mri brain show multipl white lesion sympton regular dr lean toward MS would ms sympton come strong last long episod I never realli problem I scare isnt ms I know like I see neuro probabl wont abl tell whole lot I overcom depress feel also anyon ever heard medic year sudden begin side effect drug reason I ask I take lisinopril high blood pressur 2 year I found site side effect medic I look lisinopril mani peopl write side effect drug sympton alot like one I right tingl Am I grasp straw think could med ani thought would appreci
1316,Lisinopril+hypertension,"For 6 months; I've felt miserable. It began; however; late last year with scintillating scotoma; arm weakness and tingling; tunnel vision; and a feeling that I was going to faint. These episodes would last 20-30 minutes. I was episode-free for awhile; then began to feel terrible with flu-like symptoms 6 months ago. An urgent care nurse practitioner diagnosed me with sinusitis and administered a corticosterioid injection with a round of Clarithromycin antibiotics. For a few days; I felt wonderful and on top of the world. Four days later; I had another episode of wanting to faint. I did not; yet it was everything I could do to steer away from the perceived reality that I was about to die. I literally feared for my life as I counted 1-100 simply to keep my focus. Things went progressively downhill after that episode. I went to the ER that evening with a blood pressure of 150s/115; pulse 125-150. The ER doctor administered a 100mg prescription for Metoprolol. Prior to that; I was only on .88mcgs of Levothyroxine for Hashimoto's Disease; along with 1000mg of concentrated Garlic extract. I had never had excessive hypertension; with an average blood pressure reading of 130s/70s. (Side Note: One year prior; I was having significant heart palpitations; which were checked by a cardiologist via ECG; 24-Hour Holter; Stress Test; etc. The results came back inconclusive for any damage or anything to worry about; other than PVCs and a need for weight loss/exercise.) After being on such a high dose of Metoprolol; within 2 weeks my blood pressure was still higher than before the meds (around 140/90) and the side effects were terrible. They included: dizziness; light-headedness; excessive fear; severe anxiety-like symptoms; feeling of doom; excessive tiredness; weakness; severe muscle twitching; leg swelling; stabbing pains under ribs; headache...and again; I cannot overemphasize the feelings of anxiety; which I interpreted as heart attack or stroke symptoms. They were mind numbing. I was afraid to drive; afraid to stay away from home; afraid to be in public; for fear of something like my own death occurring. To this day; those symptoms exist; to a lesser degree. After about a month on Metoprolol; I found a primary care provider (previously I did not have one); but was only ever given an appointment with a practitioner. Having been in practice only 3 months; they removed me from Metorpolol because of symptoms and a sluggish heartbeat; along with the fact it wasn't doing much for my pressure. It was replaced with Lisinopril; and I was told to followup in 3 months...3 months! I knew I couldn't wait that long. Almost immediately; I switched primary care providers hoping to see a physician. Again; I was assigned a nurse practitioner who lowered the Lisinopril dosage to 2.5mgs and told me I could not be having the symptoms I described; that ""it's in your mind."" Symptoms from the Lisinopril continued; the dizziness became more severe; and the severe ""spurts"" of anxiousness continued. It would feel like an adrenaline rush from the back of my neck; upward to my head; like hot water rushing over me; then I would want to run; literally; because I was worried about passing out or feared death. It was pure fear. Finally; I obtained doctor's permission to discontinue the high blood pressure meds altogether. Within a week; I could time the feelings of anxiety; which began to decrease more and more. The dizziness and most other symptoms subsided; except muscle twitching. For 2 months; I've been without medication; other than Levothyroxine and Garlic. My blood pressure maintains itself at either excellent or prehypertension levels; dependent on work stresses; activity; etc. My current problem is that I still feel sluggish; sometimes slightly anxious to a lesser degree (which I never did before all of this); and now there are continued muscle and neck pains; sometimes to the point of ""am I having a heart attack."" I have also developed something akin to GERD. Not a lot of acid reflux; but stomach pain that can be severe. My thyroid levels; MRIs; pituitary MRI; adrenal levels; chest x-rays; WBC; RBC; ANA; RA Factor; all came back normal. The only thing is; during this period of time; my Sed Rate and CRP levels raised from normal to very high (29 and 13.2 respectively). However; my practitioner; my endocrinologist; and a rheumatologist each say those two results are very ""non-specific."" No further tests have been ordered. Where could all this be coming from? Anxiety? Personally; I don't believe so. Stomach issues? Possibly. Cardiac issues; despite normal testing? Very possibly; I believe; especially since I've been pill free for all this time and still have PVCs that will make me dizzy or cough.

1318,Lisinopril+hypertension,I'm a 63 yr old male; and started hypertension about a decade ago. Took Lisinopril; which knocked my systolic down from the 160s to the 140s for awhile. Recently; even with Lisinopril; was spiking close to 200. New Dr. added HCTZ (diuretic) which got it back under 150; but the 2 together make me ongoingly fatigued; and dizzy upon standing up. The new doc; nor anyone else; knows why I have such high BP. I'm underweight; not overweight; never drink or smoke; eat mostly grain; veggies and a little fish with low salt; hike in the hills regularly; semi-retired; low stress life with daily meditation; definitely don't fit the profile for hypertension. Go figure rolleyes Anyway; I've recently read about studies that show a few disconcerting conclusions about BP meds; such as: - they frequently don't work; even with 3 combined meds (ACE; Calcium Chain + diuretic) - they work for awhile but then stop; and reconfiguring meds/doses doesn't help much - some studies have shown they actually increase; rather than decrease; rate of heart-attack/strokes in takers; as a side effect; even if the numbers seem to go down - other studies show the rate of heart attack/stroke in people who ran high numbers for any length of time; then successfully brought the numbers down with the meds; had just as many heart attacks/strokes as those who never brought their numbers down; indicating that once the vascular damage is done; even if meds successfully lower your numbers from that point on; it makes little difference to the damaged veins; heart and organs Obviously; if any of those points are accurate; the BP drug-makers don't want you to know; so some of these studies seem hard to locate; but I've seen 'em So I'm interested in the latest accurate info about these points; from people who really know. My cardio doc isn't one of them. He's a nice guy but he just writes me scrips for the pills and says that's the only fix.

1319,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 47 year old menopausal female. Prior to suffering CHF last July; I have not had health problems. To save a long and gruesome tale; the CHF left a left valve aortic insufficiency. The enlargement has now subsided and the EF went from 25% to 66% with the last MUGA. The follow on care of a regimen of high doses of lasix and spirolactone caused renal failure and I had emergency dialysis with no apparent permanent kidney damage. It is miraculous to have survived and the AI will eventually need to be addressed. Currently I am taking a low dose of Coreg and Lisinopril; BP is fine and generally I feel better than I probably should; all things considered. I attribute the initial CHF to my own ignoring of hypertension; my heavy smoking and a lifetime of diet pills. The renal failure was simply a medical mistake. Now I have stopped smoking (from 2 packs a day); am limiting my salt; liquid and alcohol intake and can walk for 15 minutes without chest pain. I have porked out 20 lbs and am miserable. Without nicotine; or even a lot of water to stay full; I have a monstrous appetite. I just don't know how to address it. Certainly I am limiting sugar and processed carbs; but the weight is sticking. I would sure appreciate suggestions for getting the weight off given my limitations. Thanks in advance.,2006,2006,,,,,I 47 year old menopaus femal prior suffer chf last juli I health problem To save long gruesom tale chf left left valv aortic insuffici the enlarg subsid EF went 25 66 last muga the follow care regimen high dose lasix spirolacton caus renal failur I emerg dialysi appar perman kidney damag It miracul surviv AI eventu need address current I take low dose coreg lisinopril BP fine gener I feel better I probabl thing consid I attribut initi chf ignor hypertens heavi smoke lifetim diet pill the renal failur simpli medic mistak now I stop smoke 2 pack day limit salt liquid alcohol intak walk 15 minut without chest pain I pork 20 lb miser without nicotin even lot water stay full I monstrou appetit I dont know address certainli I limit sugar process carb weight stick I would sure appreci suggest get weight given limit thank advanc
1320,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 38 year old male; 5'10 220 lbs non- smoker. Father (age 77 - had a stroke at age 72- still alive) and mother (age 63 High BP) still living and otherwise healthy. I have two have brothers ages 49 & 45; we have the same father but different mother. Both have had heart attacks and quad bypass surgeries in recent years. They were both smokers and drug & alchohol abusers. In November 2005 I had an episode in which I became dizzy; had shortness of breath and my heart began to race. I also felt chest discomfort. My wife drove me to the emergency room. After a BP check 159 / 95; EKG (normal) and some other tests such as CT Scan ;blood work; ext(all normal) the doctor recommended that I stay overite and get an echo cardiogram. I agreed to stay. I followed up with my doctor who gave me the results of the echo: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and he prescribed 10 mg Lisinopril which I have been taking daily since. About 5 years ago I had a similar episode and my doctor back then had me perform a Stress Test which came back normal. They also did a chest x ray and said that my heart was slightly enlarged but did not prescribe any meds. I often feel tired and I experience episodes of shortness of breath. The left side of my chest feels heavy and there is almost always some pressure their. I have weekly headaches; heart palpitations and even some pain in my chest. These symptoms by the way precluded my trip to the emergency room for about 5 months. I have had two episodes of pain over the last three months that I spoke to my doctor about. My doctor took and EKG after both which was normal. About a week ago he had me wear a Halter Monitor over nite which picked an episode of 125 bpm while I was driving and he said that my heart rate is pretty high for a guy my age. Usually around 85 bmp when I go for a check-up. Last week my doctor decided to prescribe me 25 mg of Metoprolol. He said that it was a small dose that might help slow my heart rate down. I have not started taking this yet as I have had anxiety about taking another pill. Over the last few months I think that I have become depressed. I have three young children and I am worried of what might happen to them and my wife should something happen to me. I have not discussed my deppression and anxiety with my doctor. My wife is upset with me b/c of not talking my depression over with my doctor. I believe that I have two separate issues: LVH and now Depression / Anxiety.

1321,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello. I am 44 year old obese man with diabetes and hypertension; both currently well controlled by medication. In the past several days I have noticed a large; irregular swelling on the inside of my scrotum; front side. It is painless. When held in my hand it's about he size of a small chicken's egg; although not well defined in shape. Consistency is about that of firm clay. Palpitating it does not cause any discomfort. Testicles seem to be normal size and regular shape. Urination and ejaculation are normal. Medications: Glucovance; Actos; Toprol XL; Lisinopril; Lasix w/pot. chloride; Paxil. Is this something which requires examination? My regular physician is an internist; should I seek a urologist's examination? Thank you for any attention to this.,2007,2007,,,,,hello I 44 year old obes man diabet hypertens current well control medic In past sever day I notic larg irregular swell insid scrotum front side It painless when held hand size small chicken egg although well defin shape consist firm clay palpit caus discomfort testicl seem normal size regular shape urin ejacul normal medic glucov acto toprol XL lisinopril lasix wpot chlorid paxil Is someth requir examin My regular physician internist I seek urologist examin thank attent
1322,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Since beginning the new year on January 1; I have lost 19 lbs (today is January 16); going from 267 lbs to 248 lbs (I am 6'2"" tall). I also have a rapid onset of stomach fullness when eating even relatively small amounts of food; and frequent; liquid diarrhea. Truth be told I don't have much appetite; and I am recovering from a bout of flu that lasted from 1/4 until about 1/11 (cough/cold; sinus pain/pressure; and generalized malaise/body aches). Concurretn with the flu; I also had an outbreak of oral herpes; for the which I took Valtrex; 2 gm Q12H x 1 day (4 gm total) and used a Zovirax ointment on the cold sores. This past week I tried to eat lots of high-fat; and fattening foods (pizza; doughnuts; burgers; rotisserie chicken) to see if I could abate or even reverse some of the weight loss; but I could not - in fact; I lost an additional two pounds. My mouth ""feels funny"" - dry and tingly; for lack of better descriptors; and I get really sleepy after eating. I drink only about 15 oz of coffee each day; in the morning. I eat pretty much everything; but have recently tried to limit my beef intake out of concern for BSE/vCJD. I am a 40 year old caucasian man. I take the following medications: Zoloft 200 mg/day (depression); Lisinopril 20 mg/day (hypertension); Singulair 20 Mg/day (extrinsic asthma); Clonazepam 0.5 mg BID (anxiety); Valtrex 1 gm PRN (oral herpes); Ambien 10 mg HS (insomnia); Tylenol #4 PRN for headache pain (taken infrequently). During my flu and herpes outbreak; I took 400 mg Ibuprofen QID for achiness and fever; which I have now been able to discontinue. I also take Claritin-D as needed for seasonal rhinitis. Ive been taking all these meds in these amounts for at least a year - none of them are new to me. Needless to say I'm afraid to go to my doctor - sounds foolish; I know - but I'm very concerned that this might be cancer; or diabetes; or something worse. I am my family's sole support - I have a small son and a stay-at-home spouse; and the thought of a serious illness scares me. The weight loss is really the scariest thing to me - I know at 6'2"" and 267 I needed to lose weight; but I'd been roughly that weight for more than a few years; and I'm a terrible dieter - I cheat constantly. I'd love feedback as to what this might or might not be. Sould it be Hepatitis? A yeast infection of some kind? Other possibilities? Parasite? Something...worse? Lastly I just had to change insurance from an open plan to a HMO - and this is just the sort of thing that scares me about HMO care - I don't want some doctor just shoving Immodium at me and waving me off - it seems like this might be serious. How do I bring appropriate gravitas to bear on the medical equation in an HMO environment? Thanks - peace and love to all of you; and I welcome your feedback.",2004,2004,,,,,sinc begin new year januari 1 I lost 19 lb today januari 16 go 267 lb 248 lb I 62 tall I also rapid onset stomach full eat even rel small amount food frequent liquid diarrhea truth told I dont much appetit I recov bout flu last 14 111 coughcold sinu painpressur gener malaisebodi ach concurretn flu I also outbreak oral herp I took valtrex 2 gm q12h x 1 day 4 gm total use zovirax ointment cold sore thi past week I tri eat lot highfat fatten food pizza doughnut burger rotisseri chicken see I could abat even revers weight loss I could fact I lost addit two pound My mouth feel funni dri tingli lack better descriptor I get realli sleepi eat I drink 15 oz coffe day morn I eat pretti much everyth recent tri limit beef intak concern bsevcjd I 40 year old caucasian man I take follow medic zoloft 200 mgday depress lisinopril 20 mgday hypertens singulair 20 mgday extrins asthma clonazepam 05 mg bid anxieti valtrex 1 gm prn oral herp ambien 10 mg HS insomnia tylenol 4 prn headach pain taken infrequ dure flu herp outbreak I took 400 mg ibuprofen qid achi fever I abl discontinu I also take claritind need season rhiniti ive take med amount least year none new needless say Im afraid go doctor sound foolish I know Im concern might cancer diabet someth wors I famili sole support I small son stayathom spous thought seriou ill scare the weight loss realli scariest thing I know 62 267 I need lose weight Id roughli weight year Im terribl dieter I cheat constantli Id love feedback might might sould hepat A yeast infect kind other possibl parasit somethingwors lastli I chang insur open plan hmo sort thing scare hmo care I dont want doctor shove immodium wave seem like might seriou how I bring appropri gravita bear medic equat hmo environ thank peac love I welcom feedback
1323,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was hoping you could answer a question I have about the location of fasciculations. I had a few thigh fascics about a week ago that lasted for three days on and off. They seem to have gotten better. Prior to that I had a week of Bilateral hand cramping which has also pretty much resolved. I've had fascics before and wasn't to worried until I came across something on ALS that said thigh fascics were characteristic which set me on edge. I saw a neurologist who specializes in Movement DO and he assured me that benign fascics can occur anywhere and he was not aware of any special association with the thigh in ALS. I have no associated weakness or atrophy. The hand cramping worries me because i don't know what caused it. What is the cause of cramping in ALS.,2003,2003,,,,,I hope could answer question I locat fascicul I thigh fascic week ago last three day they seem gotten better prior I week bilater hand cramp also pretti much resolv ive fascic wasnt worri I came across someth al said thigh fascic characterist set edg I saw neurologist special movement DO assur benign fascic occur anywher awar special associ thigh al I associ weak atrophi the hand cramp worri dont know caus what caus cramp al
1324,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Howdy. Glad I found this site. Description: 41 yr old male. Non-smoker; controlled hypertension; about 40 lbs overweight; large frame man; 6'3"" 275 lbs. I started having a-fib 4 yrs ago; age 37. Did all the test and heart seems normal except a slightly enlarged atrium; maybe due to undiagnosed HBP on my part. Went thru all the meds with no help. Had my first ablation in Austin in Jan. 2002. Went back into a-fib within 2 weeks. Doctor said give it 3 months. Same pattern developed where it would stay in for a week or two and then return to sinus for a week or two. Finally in May of 2003 I went into a-fib 24/7 and been in since. The EP says another ablation has about a 50/50 chance of working. Questions. 1). Should I try another ablation first? 2). With the failed ablation and the enlarged atrium should I just go ahead and put in the pacemaker. The EP says it has the best chance of controlling my life. 3). Does everybody experience consant dizziness and lightheadedness? Is this a symptom of the A-fib or the meds. I am currently on Diltiazm. Lisinopril; Atenolol.

1325,Lisinopril+hypertension,"History: 36 y/o male with hypertension BP 150/110 My internist perscribed 50mg Atenolol 4 weeks ago. After 1 dose; my HR dropped to about 40-45. The dosage was reduced to 12.5 mg and since my BP has been normal (120/70). However; I still have periods of low HR (40-45). I am a runnner (although not much in the past 10 months); but do not know what my resting HR was prior to starting Atenolol. The side effect in the first few days were fatigue; etc. However; in the past week or so; I've had ringing in my ears and a ""jittery"" feeling that seems to be getting worse. This prevents me from sleeping at times and when I am able to sleep; wake up during the night with these feelings. I take the medication just before I go to sleep. My doctor thinks these symptoms could be caused by anxiety and has perscribed Lexapro. He has suggested I take this for a week and then switch my BP medicine to Lisinopril due to the Bradycardia.

Questions-1.What could cause the sudden BP spikes attributing to the events described when all cardio evals are normal with no other major changes?2.Can BP really have that wide of an effect on overall health?3.With BP control could I anticipate this to now be in the past?4.Please elabotrate on the stress of BP med changes and each persons individual response to a importance of sticking with it to find the right one for each person.I was very frustrated by this but glad now I stuck with it5.Is it odd that the Toprol didn't affect me positively; but the CCB did?6.With BP much lower now I understand the lower the better with no adverse symptoms.How low is too low or is there such a thing without symptoms such as diizyness etc?

1328,Lisinopril+hypertension,1.Have you ever heard of anyone getting Bradycardia and PVC's from blood pressure medicine? I was taking Calan 180 and started having a slow heart rate; extreme weakness; shortness of breath; and multiple PVC's which. After having a heart CT scan and echocardiagram (no problems noted on either other than bradycardia and pvc's) I stopped taking the Calan and symptoms improved dramatically. Since then have tried Hyzaar; Lisinopril; and Maxzide with the same reaction to each medication. Heart rate drops into high 30 and low 40's. Shortness of breath actually is worse when HR is in normal (70-80) range. I had been taking Calan for over 10 yrs with no problems. Heart rate; PVC's; shortness of breath much improved without meds but BP goes up. 2.I think the meds may be exacerbating symptoms from some endocrine condition which is affecting my heart rate(hypothyroid maybe; I have a lot of the symptoms but TSH was 1.8- dr is testing T-4 and cortisol; Glucose/insulin problem; fasting glucose 102 and I have had non-diabetic hypoglycemic for years. Symptoms worsen after eating but could be just because my heart is working harder due to digestion. 3. Could this be an autoimmune problem affecting my heart. Have had some weird pain lately such as sprained ankle pain (could barely walk and had no injury) and hip pain (inflammatory type not nerve or muscle) that went away after taking ibuprofen and has not come back. BP also goes down if I take ibuprofen. 4.What's your opinion and do you have any ideals as to what is going on with me and/or where we should look next.

1331,Lisinopril+hypertension,I went snowboarding in MT last weekend and smoked a half pack of cigarettes Friday night and close to a whole pack on Saturday night. I usually only smoke very occasionally (4 or 5 cigarettes in a month; if even). On the train ride home on Sunday; I felt like I couldn't breath and I was sure that I was going to die. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was really short of breath; I was totally clausterphobic and felt like I just couldn't get enough O2. I had to really concentrate on breathing too as if my diaphragm wasn't going to do it for me. I couldn't sleep because I was afraid I would quit breathing in my sleep. Chest is also tight. It is almost a week later now and things have gotten better but I am still having touble breathing today. I also keep having to yawn; but can harldly ever reach that deepest part of a yawn where you feel like you accomplished something. All week long; I have also been having a strange sensation that I am going to choke when I put food in my mouth. I can only eat very small amounts of food at a time and wash it down with a lot of water. I'm sure all of this is related to the smoking last weekend at a high altitude. I am nervous that it is taking so long to resolve. I'm 27; 175lbs. and in otherwise good health. Chest x-ray; EKG; max air flow done Tues. - everything was normal.

1336,Lisinopril+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question. I am a 46 yr old male. What do you know about drug induced nipple/areola pain? This pain of mine began approximately 2 months ago and I cannot link it to any change in my life routine. The pain is felt when pressure is applied to the area and is beneath the surface. When bumped the pain can be quite sharp. My medical history includes treatment for hypertension; hyperlipidemia; chronic pain assosciated with sports injuries requiring multiple back (3); neck (1) and knee (3) surgeries; depression; sleep apnea. Meds are Lisinopril/hctz; Simvastatin; Cymbalta; Venlafaxine (yes a ssri and ssri/ne antidepressant together); Oxycodone and Tizanidine (used for sleep at 12mg -16mg hs). I too work in the medical field as a pharmacist of > 20 yrs. This has been worrying me and this site is the start of my research as to what is going on. I have no family history of breast cancer. My father at 86passed away after 5 different types of cancer. None were from metastasization. His cancer history started with prostate; thyroid; bladder; lung and bone in succession. He was a smoker until his mid 50's. Time to lick; stick and pour as they say. I will appreciate any information you have on this issue. This; I know; necessitates a visit to my own md for exam etc. In reading some of your other related messages I came across psycotropics; and prolactin and have yet had time to research.

1338,Lisinopril+hypertension,After 40 years of running; an MI and quad bypass in 2006 came as quite a surprise. Didn't take me long to get back in my running shoes however - now back to 35 - 40miles per week. BUT; increasingly I am experiencing alarming and rapid increase in HR when i start to push the pace. Even though I ease back when my HR reaches 110 and walk; it can still escalate to 135 - 180. It does come down gradually but anything other than slow walking triggers it again. Bit like when a runner 'hits the wall' I am convinced that Beta Blockers are containdicated to my lifestyle and causing my problem (BB's reducing my hearts output and running pushing it up).

1339,Lisinopril+hypertension,My son is 18; has gained approximately 60lbs in two years; prehypertension for just over a year. A couple of weeks ago is blood pressure shot up to 207/127 and stayed that high for over any hour before going to the ER. The first ER did nothing for an hour than retriaged him and his blood pressure was 195/111. At that time they said they still had several flu cases before him. We left and went to a different ER which took him back right away. His blood pressure went down on its own. They ran CBC; metabolic panel and chest xray. The blook test showed his lymphocytes were slightly elevated and his blood glucose was slightly elevated. His chest xray showed his lungs were hypoinflated. His blood pressure had been running around 140/80 before this episode. Two doctors don't seem to be worried. Am I being overprotective or should I be concerned something is going on? I really don't believe he is using drugs or alcohol.,2009,2009,,,,,My son 18 gain approxim 60lb two year prehypertens year A coupl week ago blood pressur shot 207127 stay high hour go ER the first ER noth hour retriag blood pressur 195111 At time said still sever flu case We left went differ ER took back right away hi blood pressur went they ran cbc metabol panel chest xray the blook test show lymphocyt slightli elev blood glucos slightli elev hi chest xray show lung hypoinfl hi blood pressur run around 14080 episod two doctor dont seem worri Am I overprotect I concern someth go I realli dont believ use drug alcohol
1340,Lisinopril+hypertension,Dear Doctors/medhelp members; I really need some answers please... First of all; I had my second baby; 3 months ago. For almost 2 months; I have had some creepy symptoms going on. First; I started getting headaches in the morning; late afternoon. As soon as these arrived; I had mild dizziness; which has been continuous for 2 months. I am in my mid 30's; too. As a child; and now; I am overweight; but I have lost 20 pounds (the weight of this pregnancy). Well; ok; this is what is going on now... I am having shortness of breath; dizziness; (usually when getting things) tilting my head. My gp originally thought it was sinusitis; which did seem likely; as this weird stuff began around allergy season. Also; when I was in the hospital; I had a stretching feeling when breathing- I asked the nurses who checked me with a stethoscope and didn't think anything was going on. They also did an EKG in the hospital; which was fine. I continued to have these symptoms and was taking Labetalol for pregnancy-at home by bp was low; but it seemed extremely high at the dr. I think my cuff may have been off anyway. Well; I continued to feel strange with headaches and dizzy spells; so I went to a Neuro dr; who performed a CT of the brain; EEG; and x-ray of lumbar spine. Everything came back ok; but the x-ray showed degenerative disesase; but the dr didn't think it would cause all of these issues; so he ordered a cartoid artery test-still waiting on that. When I had the test; my heart skipped several beats and the dr noticed this. I have had this happen before due to nerves; the reason why I had to take Labetalol beta blocker in the first place; but my new dr never heard the skipped beats; just assumed I needed this med. Well; I talked to my gp about my condition; and said I was thinking it might be Labetalol; as I was doing great on Lisinopril last year. She said to get off this and start taking Enalapril 10mg; instead of labetalol 100mg 2x a day. And also; this week at the dr; my pulse was 68; which she said was much lower than normal for me; and thought it was the bp issues. I have only been on enalapril for a couple of days now; but have been very short of breath. I did tell her that I was having this before taking the med this week. She said the lower pulse might cause that. I just don't understand how it would be fine during pregnancy on labetalol; but then postpartum it wouldn't? It is confusing. I hate to keep asking; diagnosing myself and so forth; but I am feeling awful. I feel like I am going to pass out alot. I wonder if it is a lung/heart issue doing this? Should I give this med a few more weeks; would I really feel this short of breath from a med I had been on for 9 months; now? The lung feeling that is starting feels like something is down low; when I breath in like a blockage; or lump in my throat at times. And; then I get dizzy when bending to get things; or talking to people; getting excited. I wish I could have some idea what is going on.

1341,Lisinopril+hypertension,My cardiologist has prescribed an increasing dosing regimen of colestipol granules to help lower my LDL level. Here are my last two most current labs from before I started the colestipol. I eat a lower fat diet; exercise by walking 40 minutes 5-6 times per week; don't smoke; control borderline hypertension with 5mg lisinopril daily; have a BMI of 30 but don't have enough self control to lose any weight. I had muscle pain and memory loss with statins; flushing and finally facial swelling with niacin supplements. The memory loss was so bad; I sold my veterinary practice and retired BEFORE the lawsuit. I ran for exercise until I wore out my left knee; now I walk.

I have two questions. I've read that colestipol may lower LDL 20% at 15gm twice daily. I'll have my blood rechecked after I've been on 30gm/d for about a 6 weeks. Is the cost (about $300/month) worth the benefit of hopefully lowering my LDL 20%? I've asked my cardiologist that question twice and not received an answer. It is a lot of money and our health insurance doesn't cover prescriptions. Second; I've tried mixing it with oatmeal; yogurt; milk; soup; tea; you name it. It's like eating sand! Since it's mostly silicate which IS sand; that isn't much of a surprize; but I don't like it. The pills were easier but cost about $1;125/month.

1342,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Thank you for taking my question - Male; 39; parasoxymal a-fib & labile hypertension; overweight (6'5""; 300#). It is believed by PCP & cardiologist that my high BP is most likely the catalyst for the a-fib (approx 1 episode lasting 2-45 minutes per 3-6 moths). Always spontaneously converts. Yesterday; BP reached 180/90 for no apparent reason. EKG taken by cardiologist as precation was normal. Cardiologist is having me drop Cardizem LA (180 mg) for Carvedilol (6.25mg 2x per day). Any reason to think this change could trigger arythmia or something else really kooky? I am told this is an excellent medication and typically very well tolerated. I tried Toprol XL before for several months. Did not tolerate it well; mainly due to severe nightmares. Once removed from the Toprol; nightmares stopped. Is this a different class of beta blocker that is safer and what (if anything) should I be concerned about?

1344,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; all - I am currently on 2 mg. diazapam (valium) and 5 mg. celexa (half a 10 mg. pill). I just started the celexa about 3 weeks ago; and have been on an even lower dose (working up frm 1/4 to half to 3/4 to 2 mg last month - my own way - I was prescribed the 2 mg.). Prior to the valium; I was on Ativan for about 2 months. My understanding from my psychiatrist is that the 'plan' is up the celexa (although I don't know how far - I have dysthymia and ocd; so I hear...) and at some point come off the valium. I also have hypertension; so take atenolol and lisinopril and a baby asprin each day. I'm 59 years old. Anyway; I see my primary care doc once a month - he is a cool old-school guy; who used to see me primarily for 'reassurance' for various anxiety / ocd issues until he decided I needed a psychiatrist to give me meds. He sent me to a colleague; who has me on these meds. Those close to me - my husband; therapist and a friend who is a former RN and who herself takes lexapro; all say I am doing 'much better' than I was. When I started posting here; I could barely eat solid food - mashed potatoes were difficult. Now; I have made some real improvement (hamburger; cut up; soft veg; and so on); although I'm not yet where I need to be (can't eat chicken; and so on.). When I saw my primary care guy yesterday; I saw I'd gained 5 lbs. OMG! I want to blame the meds but the reality is as I can eat stuff; I grab all the things that are bad for me; like donuts; cakes; chips and mex food. In any event; 5 lbs in one month seems high. My BP was also up but the doc wasn't concerned so much. He thought I might ask the psych to 'cut back' on the valium; as I complain of being 'lazy' and 'tired.' I will have been on some sort of valium in any case since February; albeit at a low dose. He also suggested asking to cut back on the celexa - to 2 mg. Huh? My psych said I wouldn't feel anything on 5 mg. I do feel somewhat tired; but I really doubt she's going to go down to 2 mg. I think my primary care doc's focus was to get me to a point where I could eat again. The psych seems to be looking at things differently - telling me I might have to take meds for my ocd 'for the rest of my life.' I am just starting the process of trying to get ON SSRI's; not off them. Aside from some nausea and tiredness / apathy; no big deal on the side effects. But I am confused. Do I try to get OFF this stuff now? If I do; will I still be able to eat? Will folks think I'm 'better?' I'm inclined to think my success is from the meds; and that if I go off; it won't be long before I'm back to square 1. I don't want to be; but why would my primary care suggest I cut back on such low doses? I serously doubt my psych would consider lowering anything at this point; I""m almost afraid to ask. I hate to bring up that my primary care doc suggested it; as they are colleagues at the same clinic - and well; in a showdown; you know who gets thrown under the bus - and it aint either of them. One or the other will say I didn't understand or whatall; just to save face... at least that's how that stuff usuall works. Ok; any one have any ideas on what i can do here? How can I discuss this w/ my psych diplomatically? She's a bit of a diva; but she seems to be very smart and I like her. I like my primary care doc too; though; and that's the problem. They both seem to have divergent opinions. As I see my psych next week; I need input asap - thanks.

1345,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; my name is Marcie. My husband is the one with a GI problem and we have no diagnosis after numerous tests. His signs and symptoms are right and left lower quadrant abdominal constant pain. The pain gets worse at times and diminishes at times. He states his pain is stabbing and constant. Nothing really makes it feel better or worse; except lying in the fetal position. He also has about 6-15 bowel movements a day depending on how he feels. His stool has been loose and watery for about 7 weeks; but now is softer and formed; sometimes black in color and sometimes light brown. He constantly feels like he has to have a bowel movement and cannot go anywhere or function with his activities of daily living because of it. He has lost about 20 pounds within four weeks without trying. He also suffers from nausea; belching; and blood; fat; and mucus in stool; and abdominal cramping. Other symptoms at times is chest tightness; body aches; waking up in middle of the night to defecate; blurry vision; fevers that come and go (max. 102.0 degrees F); flushing to face; and difficulty breathing. He also feels weak and has had loss of appetite. He is depressed because he cannot function in life without a toilet nearby. His medical history includes Hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and HCTZ; chronic sinus infections; and 7 years ago (age 23) his left arm became paralyzed with no explanation by the doctors. He regained feeling and strength to his arm after a year of rehab. He is 30 years old now. We saw a family doctor who tested his stool for Ova and parasites and did blood work on him on October 20; 2010 with all results being reported normal. We were referred to a Gi doctor who performed a colonoscopy on Nov.12th; 2010 with a diagnosis of ""nonspecific colitis."" The doctor states ""a possible carcinoid tumor was observed around the appendix and also stated the appendiceal orifice appeared somewhat unusual with wide mouth and mucosal changes."" The doctor also stated; ""Terminal ileum was slightly friable and mildly congested; throughout the colon; there appeared to be some nonspecific edema and congestion and mild erythema."" Biopsies were taken from the colonoscopy. The microscopic description states the "" the appendiceal orifice; the terminal ileum; and the right colon show an unusual amount of lymphoid tissue with no well defined germinal centers. The biopsy from the appendiceal orifice and terminal ileum were sent off for further immunohistochemical analysis to exclude a lymphoproliferative disorder; which came back benign; and suggestive of chrons disease. A small bowel series was performed on 12/03/2010 to rule out chrons disease and what a surprise; it came back normal. This doctor referred us to get a CT scan done of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV and oral contrast to check for carcinoid tumors; which was done 11/17/2010. The results of this exam stated only a mildly fatty liver with the impression of a ""grossly stable abdomen."" Furthermore; we were referred to the cancer center to rule out carcinoid tumor. He was tested for 5-HIAA in a 24 hr urine collection; cbc; cmp; chromogranin A panel; clostridrium in stool; gastrin level in blood; LDH; Ova and parasites in stool; Retic count; and serotonin blood level; as well as campylobacter; salmonella; shingella panel in stool samples. All of these are to rule out carcinoid tumors; and they all came back negative. We have a follow up appointment with this GI doctor and will see what is suggested next to rule out this rare disorder. We don't know what to do. We will probably get a second opinion; but really can't afford it. Our life is on hold because of his illness which; I’m afraid; is not going to be diagnosed. He has been on Asacol medication since November 8th and is not feeling any better.

1346,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; my question is in regards to my husbands health. He has had extreme swelling of the feet and abdomen. The swelling in his feet are bad and it goes up to around his knee area. He say's it's painful and has trouble wearing his shoes. He is an alcoholic and has been for years. I've noticed other certain physical changes as well. His face seems quite swollen and a redish color; his eye's seem bloodshot or a mixture of blood with a yellow cast to them. I guess my question is could all this swelling be due to liver failure? He does see a doctor on a reg basis about once every 3 months to get blood pressure checked (which is high) and other things too as a standard procedure with high blood press. and cholestrol etc. She never seems to concerned about the swelling and just keeps having him take more lassiks (not sure sp) but on the other hand I don't believe he shows her his feet either. They look like baloons with little toes sticking out. Would seem more likely a liver problem or a kidney problem? Sorry for all the info but thought it would be helpful.

1347,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am writing to try to get some information on what might be happening to my partner who experiences significant mood swings/behavioral changes at times. He refuses to go to the doctor so I am wondering if someone here can help me. First some information on his background and condition: Caucasian Male 39 yrs old. 30 Lbs overweight Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tachycardia Former methamphetamine user (used for many years; but has been clean for 10+ yrs.) Binge drinker (1 or 2 times a week) Current medications: Lisinopril (Blood Pressure) Atenolol (Heart Rate) Valium (for anxiety) Insulin injections (Humulin R; N) Basically; his behavior can go from 'normal' (calm; not agitated; clear-headed; etc.) to what I am calling ""Altered"" in a matter of minutes. During these episodes his behavior will deteriorate where he will gradually start acting like he is intoxicated; even though he has not been drinking. It will begin with slight mood changes and speech changes (such as mild slurring; searching for the correct word; etc.). General mood will be happy and sometimes giddy; unless he becomes agitated by something; which tends to happen very easily. If he becomes agitated or angry then his mood will further decline to belligerent or even violent behavior. He will say hurtful things intentionally and become verbally abusive. This negative mood shift does not always happen. In either case; it seems the only way for him to return to 'normal' is to sleep for 6+ hours. It seems like mentally stressful situations may bring this on; although I have also seen it happen after heavy meals. His Diabetes is not well controlled; and he often has high blood sugar spikes. He also does not take his other medications exactly as prescribed; instead choosing to take them whenever he remembers. He often takes 2 Valium at once; 1 time a day instead of 1 every 12 hours. Sometimes he skips a day.

1348,Lisinopril+hypertension,OK...so it's been almost 3 weeks on Toprol XL (25mg) and I CAN'T BREATH! I have asthma already and absolutely cannot breath; which I now find out can be a side effect of Toprol. I literally can't walk 50 feet without having to rest and heave and ho and huff and puff on an inhaler to breath. While the Toprol is pretty much controlling my blood pressure; it does not last the full 24 hours. After about 20 hours; my BP shoots up; my breathing gets even WORSE and I feel like hell until I take the pill and it kicks in. My doc has now put me on Cardia XT; starting tomorrow; and I'm curious if anyone has taken this drug; expecially if coming directly off another like Toprol.

1351,Lisinopril+hypertension,Some history: My 74 year old mother who has been very healthy her whole life; was diagnosed as having high blood pressure (160's/90's) last year. Prior to this; she had never had any problems with hypertension. She has tried to control it with diet (low sodium) and has been moderately successful (BP varies: the last time she gave blood it was 125/80something; but was 160/85 at a recent doctors appointment). At that same dr's appointment; she was found to have low hemoglobin (10). Her doctor prescribed iron and had her do a stool sample (she has not received the results yet).

1352,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi. I'm a 22 year old male and for the past 5 years or so I've had a pounding heart where I've always been able to feel my heart beating; specifically in my abdomen area. My stomach and shirt would always be visibly shaking with my pulse and when anxious it would pound even harder. The past month; however; it feels like my heart is beating a lot softer. Today; I often cannot feel my heartbeat and cannot see my pulse in my stomach except when I'm anxious. When I'm anxious; it still pounds (what feels like) extremely hard. I guess this is more normal to have an unnoticeable heartbeat so maybe I shouldn't even be worried but I'm not used to this at all and it's making me very worried because I don't know what could have caused this change. I haven't changed my diet or exercise and I'm more stressed than ever. My first guess is that my blood pressure may have dropped. A few years ago I went to see my doctor about my pounding heart and when he took my blood pressure it was very high (around 180 systolic). I then sat in a room for 5 minutes to calm down and the systolic number dropped to about 155. However; I don't think my blood pressure was normally that high and I just attribute it to anxiety or ""white coat syndrome"". I bought a blood pressure monitor about a month ago at the time when my heartbeat was starting to feel softer and I've been taking a lot of readings since and they have been pretty good (usually 110-130 systolic; 60-80 diastolic when sitting) but this is when I'm at home; completely calm. I don't know what my at-home blood pressure was when I had a pounding heart so I don't know if it even dropped. Also; I believe my resting heart rate has increased a bit over the past month (maybe around 10 bpm). Other possible causes I've come up with: weight gain (weight around stomach area causing me to not feel the pulse there anymore? I haven't really gained weight in the past month though); heart is contracting differently or failing or there is some blockage (afraid of this). So; are any of the causes I've listed above plausible? Should I be concerned about this change in heartbeat forcefulness and potential drop in blood pressure considering I haven't changed my lifestyle? Are you able to see / feel your heartbeat at all times? I've developed fairly severe hypochondria over my heart to the point where I'm constantly checking my pulse; losing sleep worrying and even having dreams about waking up with a heart attack... I just want to know if I should be concerned at all. I have an appointment next week but a week seems like so long.

1355,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi all--This seems like a great; supportive site. Back in December; I started getting terrible pains in my lower left abdomen. My dr thought it was diverticulitis; but sent me for a CT scan; which showed a small cyst on my left ovary (1.7 x 1.5 x 2.3); but not enough to cause me such pain. I am 42 years old; in very good general health (except high bp); never had a baby--and 12 years ago I was misdiagnosed with PCOS. Anyway; I went to my gyn (who is also an oncologist); and he was unimpressed and said come back in a month. yseterday was a month--they did an ultrasound which showed that the cyst has doubled in size and is 100% fluid-filled; simple. Might be a septum; or not. My gyn ordered a CA125; but wants to remove the cyst anyway if it doesn't clear up in a month. Also; I have been under HUGE amounts of stress; and somehow; when I'm not in my office; the pain disappears. My periods have been normal until last September; when I started getting them intermittently. My mother went through menopause at 42; so nobody was alarmed. My question: how likely is it that a fluid-filled cyst can be cancerous? And has it ever been shown that stress impacts cysts and/or cancer? Thanks so much for your help.,2006,2006,,,,,Hi allthi seem like great support site back decemb I start get terribl pain lower left abdomen My dr thought diverticul sent CT scan show small cyst left ovari 17 x 15 x 23 enough caus pain I 42 year old good gener health except high bp never babyand 12 year ago I misdiagnos pco anyway I went gyn also oncologist unimpress said come back month yseterday monththey ultrasound show cyst doubl size 100 fluidfil simpl might septum My gyn order ca125 want remov cyst anyway doesnt clear month also I huge amount stress somehow Im offic pain disappear My period normal last septemb I start get intermitt My mother went menopaus 42 nobodi alarm My question like fluidfil cyst cancer and ever shown stress impact cyst andor cancer thank much help
1356,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am 33 year old male...6'4"" and 238 pounds. I have had 2 ablations for AVNRT SVT tachycardia last year; May and July at UPMC. No more SVT that I have noticed since second procedure. After the second procedure I developed a PE. I was on warfarin for 6 months and then in Jan 07 I went to a hemotologist and had many tests that were ok; so I stopped warfarin. At the same time; due to daily aspirin and severe anxiety from heart issues; I developed gastric and duodenal ulcers. I went on protonix and was fine in a few weeks. In October 06 I had more abdominal symptoms; had upper endo to reveal small ulcer. I took more protonix and was ok again. I was put on Klonopin for anxiety around that time as well. I also have PVCs; which I always have had a few here and there since I can remember; but they are much worse now...and have been much worse since the SVT appeared in Feb 06. I have bad pvc attacks and bigeminy; trigeminy at times (usually when I first wake up and a half hour after I eat until about two hours after I eat). I have had MRI for ARVD that was negative. I have had gastric emptying study which was normal; and a repeat endoscopy showed everything healed and a small hiatal hernia. Had ultrasound for gall bladder/pancreas which was unremarkable. Had HIDA scan that showed normal gall bladder emptying. I should also mention that I have had MRI/MRA for headaches I have been having and they revealed nothing remarkable. An Echocardiogram I had one year ago showed a a left ventricle end diastole measurement of 5.9 cm. I had another echo 6 months later that indicated the same measurement at 6.3 cm. Wall thickness measurements and atrium etc... all within normal size limits. My ejection fraction was 50% and 49% respectively. The MRI in August of last year showed a EF of 49%. For over a year I have not had caffeine; or alcohol; and I never have smoked.

1357,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Im a 25 years old and for the most of my quarter of a century of life; i have been pretty normal. In February of this year i had eaten an extremely large meal and felt very light-headed afterwards. My symptoms were a racing heart and a feeling of fainting. I didnt know what was going on so i began to panic due to the fact that i had never felt that way before. I went into my car and locked the door and just lied down hoping it would go away which it did eventually. My dad was with me and he had said ""son; u just ate too much"" so the anxiety kinda went away; or did it...? For the next couple weeks i had returned to normal but in the back of my mind i thought ""what really happened that day"". I begen overdwelling on things afterwards such as arm pains ; headaches; ect ect..which eventually brought back the same feeling. I had told my parents about my feelings and my mother had told me to go to the supermarket and have your blood pressure taken at the pharmacy; so i did...I went in feeling very nervous and as the machine squeezed my arm i began to feel my heart race. My reading was 152/92 and i FREAKED OUT and had a full blown panic attack! I somehow drove myself to the hospital and they calmed me down; gave me an EKG which was normal except for the beats per minute obvoiusly and they were able to calm me down and once my blood pressure came back down to 130/80 they let me go and told me to try taking xanax. I went online and read the side-effects and decided that i shouldnt start taking medication at my age.I decided to visit a carteologist just to be safe. When i was there; i was extremely nervous and my ""bp"" was 140-100 . They really didnt say much about that probably due to the fact that they knew i was nervous; however my heart overall was fine. It is now june 2006 and have developed an enormous phobia about blood pressure and decided to purchase my own blood pressure monitor for my home(this made things worse) and everytime i apply the cuff i get nervous and it is always high. I decided to visit the hospital again and try and overcome the fear again so i could convince myself i didnt have high blood pressure. Once again i started to feel nervous and began to have another anxiety attack(arms tingling;heavy chest; ect ect) thus when they took it; it was high. They gave me a xanax pill and came back about 30 mins later and my blood pressure was 128/78. The following day i went back to the hospital again and took a xanax and it was 120/70.My blood pressure phobia is slowing deminishing; however my new worry is that ""is my blood pressure only normal when i am on xanax"" is xanax made to lower blood pressure and if someone that has hypertension took xanax; would their blood pressure come down too? I feel as though i am losing controle of my life and have a fear of developing ""ocd"".Do you think i have hypertension;or is this all in my mind?

1363,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am a 48 year old female in pretty good health. Last month I went home from work with what appeared as the flu. I felt achey and my stomach hurt. I had been feeling strange; kind of anxious for no reason. I went home to bed. I woke up around midnight with a horrible pain in my upper stomach. I had my galbladder out about 7 years ago but the pain i had was exactly the same pain; same area. It got so bad my husband took me to the emergency room. They ran blood tests and gave me a shot for the pain; which helped. The test came back with elevated SGOT and SGPT levels; they sent me home and told me to see my dr asap. I went the next day; he told me my levels in the hospital were 215 and 440; he took more blood tests and told me he was sure it was hepatitis. He sent the test out and in a week the test came back negative; but the levels went up alittle higher; 250 and 470. about a week later he took more tests and they also came back negative; but the levels had come down to 45 and 60. The dr doesn't know what happened. He told me to come back in a month to have another test. My family and friends are a little concerned as to why they would be so high. The dr said it could have been hepatitis; and that it was just to early to show up. I know hepatitis is contagious... Should I be concerned? I still don't feel ""right"" and I am very very tired still...I have never had any jaundice; which is strange. the only things that I have felt; is the initial attack and being very very tired.

1364,Lisinopril+hypertension,"A little over 4 years ago I sustained a lower back injury in a horse accident. I was bucked off and I landed on a hard dirt driveway mostly on my right buttock and somehow also cracked my helmet in half. I had rads taken which showed minor disc compression at L5-S-1; but was told was normal for my age (I'm 43 now). I was rx'd NSAIDS and rest. Since then; I have always had lumbar pain on the right side and continue to this day to take ibuprofen; 600 mg BID. I have several health problems; bipolar 2 disorder; obesity; hypertension; fibromyalgia; and chronic Lofgren's Syndrome (erythema nodosum and polyarthraligia on and off for the last 10+ yrs). I frequently complained of back pain to my primary care physician; and was advised to lose weight to aleviate pain and try to get off the advil. At least twice a year; I would get erythema nodosum; for which prednisone was rx'd. My occupation as a veterinary technician required quite a bit of physical strength and flexibility; but when I was put on disability a year ago; my back problems worsened significantly from lack of *working*. Finally; 8 mos ago; l was helping push a dresser into place and my back seized/froze. The next morning; lumbar rads were taken which showed DDD. I was unable to progress in physical therapy due to extreme pain; I literally cried! I was on the wait list for an MRI; so while waiting; I was sent to the rheumatology dept and began to treat my fibromyalgia again; this time with flexiril and elavil (and my ibuprofen). My MRI report said that disc L-5 S-1 was desiccated and also had moderate DDD and end plate degeneration. There is a vascular hemangioma in L-3. My HMO's pain clinic suggests epidural injections to treat my pain; and if that didn't work; a laminectomy would be the next option. I wanted to wait and try alternative tx; so I have been going weekly to a chiropractor for gentle adjustments and stretching; and also spinal massage weekly. The gal that does the massages said I probably had lot of adhesions; because it was very painful the 1st 3 or 4 spinal massages. She works on the lower right lumbar area a lot and said I must have torn muscles in the accident; all the muscles that connect trunk to hip appeared to be painfully atrophied. The paraspinal muscles also spasm if a knuckle is pressed into it or any of the deep muscles in the area. My rheumatologist advised me to tell my chiro to avoid trying to adjust L-5; S-1 as it is too painful; and about to start fusing. The rheumatologist suggested accupuncture for the lumbar pain and believes it beneficial for fibromyalgia patients. I have not tried accupuncture as of yet; wanting to give time to see if chiro and spinal massage was going to work. I have improved significantly as far as being able to MOVE; yet still suffer muscular pain only on the right side of my lower back. I realized I have probably reached maximum benefit from the chiro office; so I contacted my HMO patient representative to discuss finding out the source of the pain via the ""Physical Medicine"" dept. I was seen in the physical medicine dept. 2 1/2 weeks ago. The Dr performed movement tests to see my range of motion. She said I should have the epidural; and when I questioned her about my muscles hurting; she said my pain was discogenic. I know that muscles are innervated and that pain can radiate; but when I press those muscles while standing perfectly still; a painful rebound spasm happens instantly--so how can it be neural pain if I take my own finger and depress the muscle instead of say; bending or twisting to make the muscle move? I explained the pain exactly like that and the Dr said she'd be right back. She came back after reading my MRI report and radiology report; again said that my pain was discogenic...she was smiling that polite ""you are done; time to go"". I thought it strange she had not even LOOKED at or TOUCHED my back; so I asked her to please examine and palpate the muscles so she can see for herself and put it in my chart. She did; and our 10 minutes were up. Anyway; as you probably can tell by now; I mistrust the HMO for ignoring my complaints of chronic back pain for 3 1/2 years; until it was too late; there is no way to un-dessicate my disc (lol) and I feel that simply injecting steroids into my epidural space will not address the muscles that hurt. Because my chronic Lofgren's Syndrome (a varient of sarcoidosis) I am leery of doing epidurals--what if my body overreacts to the intrusion of a needle into the space; and scar tissue forms around the puncture? I hear all the time how people are worse off after doing invasive things to already damaged spines. I bought a TENS unit and use it frequently on the massage setting and find it really complements the chiro and spinal massages--This is why I believe the majority of my pain to be muscular in origin. The tens unit enabled me to feel ok enough to attempt something I hadn't done in a year--I rode my horse (not the one that bucked me off 4 yrs ago!) I am delighted that I experienced no additional pain. Currently; meds I take are: Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) 150 mg bid Depakote (valproic acid) 500 mg Cyclobenzaprine HCL (flexiril) 10 mg bid Lisinopril/HCTZ 10-12.5 mg sid Amitriptyline (elavil) HCL 25 mg sid Ibuprofen 600 mg BID I welcome any insight or comments from others. I am thinking of going outside of my HMO to get another opinion. Sorry my post is so long and involved; but thought giving a full history best.

1365,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was ""a little off"" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested?

1366,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello and thank you for your time. I am a 37 year old woman; 5'6"" 258lbs. My main complaint is palpitations which have taken me to the ER more than once. My BP is generally 122-139 over 89-103; most recently 122/98.In the last 9 months I have had 2 episodes of SVT; this finally got me to a cardio who did a an echo and treadmill test;48 hr holter; and EKG. The echo was normal except for mild mitral regurg; and pac's/pvcs. The treadmill was also good except for my heart rate rose too quickly; obviously due to being obese. My EKG showed inverted p-waves. The holter showed I was having about 1-2% of total heart beats being PAC's. My cardio explained that I have what is called a junctional heart rythm; that my heart has created an extra pathway which he says is causing the PAC's. He talked to an EP ; who said he would consult with me if I wanted to but it was up to me. My cardio put me on ToprolXL 25mg.for pac's but it doesnt seem to be helping the diastolic reading ;still cant get it below 89; though the systolic goes down at times to 115 and pulse 52. Also the PAC's seem worse. Im wondering and worried as to why there is such a discrepency between the diastolic and systolic numbers. I did have a Kenalog (steroid) shot recently due to walking pneumonia. I have dropped 20lbs and am using the treadmill 45 mins per day; every day. Im on a very low carb diet.

The electrocardiogram monitoring/graph showed text book until I was on the treadmill. I took an Exercise Stress Test as part of an annual physical. The doctor indicated the results as abnormal with anterior ST segment depression. The work up was as follows: HR/RPP/METS: HR at rest: 55/min; Max. HR: 160/min (99% of Target HR: 161/min). Max.

1369,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 48 year old female who was diagnosed with hypertension at age 39 when I went to the Urgent Care with a sharp pain behind one eye and was found to have a BP of 211/110. I have taken Lisinopril with good results. I have a long history of depression and anxiety and had been placed on Paxil about a year before the high BP started. I had bad side effects from the Paxil and several other SSRIs I tried; so about a year ago I tapered off them. I immediately began having nightmares and panic attacks in my sleep; and did not realize that my BP was extremely high during these events until I had a cerebellar hemorrhage. Luckily; I lived and had no long term effects from the hemorrhage. I have been taking Clonazepam for sleep and Citalopram in the morning for anxiety; and I feel great most of the time. Now I only get sleep disturbances and high blood pressure at the onset of my period. I take Mircette for birth control. My family doctor; cardiologist and neurologist are at a loss for any answers. A cardiology workup turned out all good. I would love to know why my BP only goes high at night; and why only when I am on the inert week of birth control pills. The hemorrhage also occurred the day I started my period. I have been thin and healthy all of my life and there is no family history of high blood pressure.,2008,2008,47.0,Female,,,hello I 48 year old femal diagnos hypertens age 39 I went urgent care sharp pain behind one eye found BP 211110 I taken lisinopril good result I long histori depress anxieti place paxil year high BP start I bad side effect paxil sever ssri I tri year ago I taper I immedi began nightmar panic attack sleep realiz BP extrem high event I cerebellar hemorrhag luckili I live long term effect hemorrhag I take clonazepam sleep citalopram morn anxieti I feel great time now I get sleep disturb high blood pressur onset period I take mircett birth control My famili doctor cardiologist neurologist loss answer A cardiolog workup turn good I would love know BP goe high night I inert week birth control pill the hemorrhag also occur day I start period I thin healthi life famili histori high blood pressur
1370,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I am a 48-yo female who had a hypertensive bleed in Feb 2007. I began having hypertension about ten years ago; after my doctor started me on Paxil (coincidence?). I take Lisinopril 20 mg twice a day. I was on SSRIs for nine years and went off of them in April 2006 with great difficulty. I went from sleeping all the time to not being able to sleep at all. I was put on Trazadone and was able to sleep 6-7 hours; but with nightmares interrupting my sleep a few times each night. I did not realize that my blood pressure was going extremely high during the night. It dropped as soon as I got up in the morning; and was always normal when checked in the doctor's office. Then I had a cerebellar hemorrhage after getting out of bed one morning. No one could understand why this happened. I thought about my poor sleep and began checking my blood pressure as soon as I awoke from a nightmare; and sure enough; it was sky high. I am now better with Clonazepam for sleep; except during the last week of my birth control pills (the inert pills). My blood pressure still gets extremely high around the time of my period. Could the years of SSRIs have messed up my hormones and caused my high blood pressure? I had extreme withdrawal symptoms when I tapered off them. Secondly; I feel better while on birth control pills; but have trouble with my BP without the hormones. What could cause that? All my doctors are stumped. Thank you very much for reading my post.,2008,2008,47.0,Female,,,hello I 48yo femal hypertens bleed feb 2007 I began hypertens ten year ago doctor start paxil coincid I take lisinopril 20 mg twice day I ssri nine year went april 2006 great difficulti I went sleep time abl sleep I put trazadon abl sleep 67 hour nightmar interrupt sleep time night I realiz blood pressur go extrem high night It drop soon I got morn alway normal check doctor offic then I cerebellar hemorrhag get bed one morn No one could understand happen I thought poor sleep began check blood pressur soon I awok nightmar sure enough sky high I better clonazepam sleep except last week birth control pill inert pill My blood pressur still get extrem high around time period could year ssri mess hormon caus high blood pressur I extrem withdraw symptom I taper secondli I feel better birth control pill troubl BP without hormon what could caus all doctor stump thank much read post

1372,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was morbidly obese @ 320 pounds; depressed with no sex drive. I managed through working out drop to about 250 pounds in six months. But it was a real struggle doing 3 hours of cardio per day with 30 minutes of strength training 5-6 days a week. But the low sex drive pressured but my wife to get my testosterone checked. It was <20ng/dl with the normal range being 240-850. Virtually undetectable. So about 8 months ago; I was prescribed testosterone replacement; initially @ 100mg every 2 weeks which brought my test levels close to 200; still low. So it was upped to 100mg/week. Since that time my left ventricular wall thickness has increased from 1.1 cm to thickened at 1.8 cm. I have also gained about 30 pounds of muscle to be about 260 pounds. I look like a pro football player and I was very muscular having lifted from age 15-25 years so I chaulked it up to regaining my muscle memory. What I did not like is that my heart has thickened. I dont know if it is because of getting an athletic heart from weightlifting. My weighttraining is not much 8 sets per bodypart once a week with loads of cardio. Blood pressure is labile; meaning somedays particulary after cardio days can be as low as 90/60 with bp meds and I get lightheaded and cant work out. Then if I stop my bp meds it can be 150/90. Drives me nuts. My dose is now adjusted from 40mg of lisinopril to 20mg and my hctz is cut in half to 12.5mg daily. But because I was skipping my bp meds due to the severe lightheadedness almost falling a few times. That it may have contributed to the left ventricular hypertrophy. I did a stress echo and although it showed a thick left ventricle; my exercise capacity was superior having gone 17 minutes on a bruce protocol on the treadmill. Right now; I dont know what to do really. I want to keep my blood pressure low and hope to reverse the thickening but I dont want to have sudden cardiac death in an athlete in the meantime. I am wondering what I can do as far as anti-arrythmics; a betablocker; bystolic or even coreg to slow my heart function down to help reverse this. Cardiologist doesnt know as he thinks its from the testosterone; working out and blood pressure issue. Which all makes sense. So I go from super depressed obese guy to looking fit and muscular (a bit too much for my liking) and also having a meatball for a heart. My goal was to not get diabetes when I started working out hard but now worried about sudden cardiac death from the hypertrophy. I cant go off the testosterone as I cant function and I dont want to quit working out and go back to being obese. Any suggestions and yes; I am definitely trying to keep my blood pressure under 120/80 with the ace inhibitor; just wondering about the betablockers.

1373,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hello; I'm feeling really strange today and I cannot make it to my doctor until Monday so I figured I might ask here and see what people had to say. I'm a 31 year old male; with GERD and Hypertension. I'm currently taking Nexium 40mg 1x per day and Lisinopril 20mg 1x per day. I am overweight and not as active as I could be. I am 5'8"" and weight about 220 lbs. I am a non-smoker and I do not drink frequently or use recreational drugs. Currently I've been experiencing flushing of the face and episodes of light headedness. I did go to my doctor once about the flushing issue but at the time the light headedness was not a pronounced symptom. He tested my blood pressure and ruled that out as it has been well controlled by my medicine. He also drew blood for to test for Gall Bladder issues and my blood sample came back within normal ranges on for all his testing parameters including blood glucose and cholesterol. Today I am flushed once again; I have pretty bad stomach pain to the point where if push on my stomach area it hurts. I also feel as though if I move my head too quickly I might pass out. I am not dizzy nor do I actually pass out if I move too quickly but the sensation is there. The flushing seems most pronounced after eating but can occur at any time and can last anywhere from ten minutes to over an hour. The light headedness comes and goes and varies in severity today is the worst it has ever been and it has been happening since I woke up this morning. Is there any chance this is related to my GERD? Or; should I be looking at other possible causes for this problem. My plan is currently to get back to my doctor on Monday and discuss seeing a gastro-intestinal specialist to further evaluate what is going on with me. Any advice or suggestion is appreciated.",2010,2010,,Male,,,hello Im feel realli strang today I make doctor monday I figur I might ask see peopl say Im 31 year old male gerd hypertens Im current take nexium 40mg 1x per day lisinopril 20mg 1x per day I overweight activ I could I 58 weight 220 lb I nonsmok I drink frequent use recreat drug current ive experienc flush face episod light headed I go doctor flush issu time light headed pronounc symptom He test blood pressur rule well control medicin He also drew blood test gall bladder issu blood sampl came back within normal rang test paramet includ blood glucos cholesterol today I flush I pretti bad stomach pain point push stomach area hurt I also feel though I move head quickli I might pass I dizzi I actual pass I move quickli sensat the flush seem pronounc eat occur time last anywher ten minut hour the light headed come goe vari sever today worst ever happen sinc I woke morn Is chanc relat gerd Or I look possibl caus problem My plan current get back doctor monday discuss see gastrointestin specialist evalu go ani advic suggest appreci
1374,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi I'm an overweight; 35 yr old; soon to be ex smoker (just started Chantix) mother of 2. I have hypertension which is now fairly under control finally. I take Tekturna 300 mg; Cardizem LA 360mg; Hydrodiuril 25mg; and Lisinopril 20 mg. I do have a history of heart disease in my family on both my father and mother's side. Mom had stents placed when in her early 50's. Dad had quadruple bypass at 60 and recently passed from a massive heart attack in March. I have had occasional pvc's since my early 20's. They have increased somewhat over the years but never really concerned me. My mother had them; my siblings have them and I never have felt ill as a result of them. They never really bothered me and I was always told it was normal especially for the women in my family. About 2 years ago I had some pretty bad chest pain while at work and went to the er. My ekg showed Left Bundle Branch Block and ischemia. My bp was pretty high at the time. They gave me nitro and was I was observed overnight. There was no enzyme elevation. I was released the following day and scheduled for a stress test. The test came back normal. I went on for awhile with no problems; except for the HTN. Last January had another episode of bad chest pain that radiated down left arm and into my jawline. Also had a run of vtach...scary. So I had the stress test done again and an echocardiogram. Again; no blockages and echo was normal. Rocked on for a few more months with no problems; just occasional; not really bothersome pvc's. So that's all the history til now. In May I was lying on my right side reading; very relaxed; in fact almost falling asleep when my heart started beating out of rhythm. It felt similar to pvc's but not organized and just more of a flutter and flopping in my chest. This lasted for about 10 minutes. I saw my Internist the next day and he ordered a 30 day event monitor for me. I finished it 2 weeks ago. Nothing abnormal showed on the readings; just the same occasional pvc's and some pac's. I woke up and was getting ready for work this past Monday when my heart went into that weird rhythm again as that night a couple of months ago. I just tried not to panic and thought it would go away. It didn't; it went on for about an hour so I called my dr. He wanted me to come in for an ekg. I ended up stopping at the er because it was closer to get to and the rhythm just felt out of control and would not go back to normal. I started having chest pain with it and feeling light headed too. I was triaged and they said I was tachy at 110 with some abnormalities on my ekg but they didn't tell me what they were. 3 hours later of continuous weirdness and some pain in my chest they finally took me back to a bed in the er. Shortly after I lay on my back the irregular rhythm stopped. They checked my enzymes-normal; did a chest xray and sent me on my way to follow up with a cardiologist. I saw him the next day and he recommended the heart cath to rule out any blockages. The cath (on Wednesday) showed only one artery with hardening; but no blockages. The cardiologist said my heart was ""near normal"" with everything looking good but that one hardened artery. And the abnormal rhythm didn't return again until the next day. Everyday now I have long runs off and on all day of this strange rhythm; sometimes it feels like 3 solid beats and then 3 little fast ones on top of another. Other times it's totally different. It's very uncomfortable. And it will go on for hours. They happen when I'm walking; sitting; talking; eating; resting. They don't seem to be brought on by anything particular and I have cut my caffeine intake drastically. Since the heart cath results were ok and my doctors really don't seem to be concerned; do I just try to ignore the irregular rhythms and go on? Sometimes I feel light headed; sometimes a little sob. It's just so unusual and uncomfortable. I guess I just feel like this is significant but no one else does so maybe I'm just not understanding how my rhythm can go out of control so quickly like this and then be called ""normal."" I have started walking daily and have already lost some weight prior to these last episodes to try to get in better shape. My doctor said to continue doing that and stop smoking and I would be fine. My feelings right now about it is if they are not concerned I guess I shouldn't be and when I'm an ex smoker for a couple of months and lost a little more weight if this doesn't go away then maybe I should speak up again? I'm sorry this post is so long. If there is any light anyone can shed for me; thank you.

1377,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin?

1378,Lisinopril+hypertension,"First off; my apologies if this is a bit wordy but I want to make sure I get all the details in. In 2008 I had a work-related injury (I fell into a building foundation) and broke the end of a bone completely off (I don't remember the name of the bone but its in my right ankle...tibia I think but I could be wrong). It was surgically repaired with a plate and screws. For a few years it was fine...a few aches here and there but nothing really bad. But for the last 2 years or so it's been acting up. It starts to hurt more mainly when it's cold/wet outside or I've been on my feet for long periods of time combined with a lot of lifting. There have been days where I'm seriously limping and in pain at the end of the day. A couple of months ago I started seeing a doctor on a regular basis (I just recently got insurance again)....well; not exactly a doctor; he's an APRN. He was recommended to me so I decided to see him. For the most part he's a nice guy and has (to his credit) been very helpful in bringing my blood pressure under control but when I tried to discuss the trouble I'm having with my ankle; he blew it off....he acted as though it shouldn't be hurting and then gave me a speech about how he doesn't like to prescribe anyone any kind of narcotic pain meds. Now I DID NOT ask for any meds of any kind...I just tried to tell him that my ankle hurts. Nor did I bring this problem up on my first visit....I wanted to get my BP under control before I worried about anything else. So now I'm unsure of what to do. I've considered finding a new PCP but I don't want to be seen as ""doctor shopping"". Nor do I want to be seen as a ""drug seeker"". I'll admit; it would be helpful to have meds when the pain gets really bad; but honestly I'm afraid to ask for fear of being labeled. If another method besides medication would be more effective then that's perfectly fine...I just want this to be taken more seriously. I'm about to start a new job that has a lot of potential but requires me to do a lot of lifting....and I certainly can't jeopardize it by calling off because my ankle is killing me from the previous day. Here's some basic info about me in case that might be helpful for someone here to give some advice: 37 years old; male; 6ft; 200lbs.

1380,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Bio: 21 year old male; 12% body fat 215 pounds; average diet; physically active. Family history: hypertension; fibromyalgia; asthma; valvular disease; great grandpa died of a heart attack; great grandma of stroke; 3 family members have had their gallbladder removed. Past surgeries: deltoid reconstruction. Medications: lisinopril; Zoloft; Xanax (prescribed but don't use). Symptoms: onset at 16; during mile-run fitness test in gym I suffered extreme chest pain radiating up neck; became cyanotic. Echocardiogram indicated aortic insufficiency +1; EKG yielded no significant findings; normal sized chambers; no hypertension; hypertrophy or other cardiac precursors. Chest pain has persisted every day the past 5 years with a gradual increase of severity that has sped up as of late. Chest pain is localized approximately 3 cm lateral of the sternum at a height of 3.5 cm higher than nipple. Chest pain is a squeezing; crushing pain with occasional spurts of sharp stabbing pain like I'm being harpooned right through the chest. Pain is localized and does not radiate through the chest except for in a fine line up my neck and down my shoulder. Pain is persistent day to day with no relief and work has become difficult due to extreme exhaustion. On top of 8 hours of sleep a night I take a 3 hour nap when I get home. Job is mildly physically intensive grocery store labor. Chest pain is accompanied by purple; swollen hands and feet which I've been prescribed compression socks for. Hypertension has developed over the past few months. Extreme shortness of breath; no wheezing or asthma (had adolescent asthma which my cardiologist suspected I still have so she put me on a formoterol fumarate inhaler which has not provided even the slightest relief in the two months I've been on it); I can't even climb a set of stairs without feeling my pulse pound in my cheeks; hands and neck and feeling like it's extremely difficult to draw a breath. The SOB worsens when seated; lying flat; hunched or bent over; and when exercising. My heart pounds; you can see my carotid throb (not just slightly; but quite a bit) when my heart beats and I can hear and feel my heartbeat 24/7 (not just when i concentrate.... Even when I'm distracted or working). For years my BP never rose over 130/80 and through a BP diary I've tracked it at 155/100-190/120. Doctor prescribed lisinopril to control it. Diet and a healthy lifestyle seem to not affect it at all. My lifestyle isn't very stressful; I don't do any recreational drugs and drink only on occasion. My resting pulse pressure of 85 on average has been linked to heart disease when compared to individuals with a normal pulse pressure of 40 (120-80=40 : 120/80) at a resting rate.. As I'm typing this my BP was 145/60. A second echocardiogram done a few weeks ago revealed both atria were enlarged; the aortic insufficiency had worsened slightly; and my LVPW (left ventricle posterior wall) was mildly thickened. My left ventricle outflow tract has a slightly increased velocity of 1.24m/s. My dads side of the family all has hypertension with completely normal echo's other than my dad who says his doctor told him he has a ""sticky valve."" He's never had any chest pain or other symptoms associated with his heart. I have a history of prescription drug abuse in my teens; tramadol; Percocet; Vicodin; codeine; Xanax; but it has been 3 years since any abuse occurred. A cardiologist reviewing my echo stated my report came back completely normal and nothing with my heart could be causing my symptoms; including the AI. I've read dozens of published medical articles that say otherwise. Some people have symptoms some don't. I can't find a decent specialist that will take the time to figure out my predicament. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy usually starts presenting itself in the second decade of life; sometimes with mildly hypertrophy other times with none until the disease has progressed.

1381,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?",2009,2009,,Female,,,medic histori My mom age 71live singapor histori hypertens she hospit 509 drug hypertens medic methyldopa induc cholestasi prescrib new Dr while hospit diagnos atrial fibril 2de result normal LV size systol function No rwma lvef 59 normal pasp 26mmhg trivial aortic tricuspid regurig aspirin 100 mg prescrib ecg attach her hospit chest apsit result the heart size accur assess appear enlarg there mild promin hilar vessel suggest mild congest she recruit warfarin vs apixaban doubl blind clinic trial start treatment aug4 2009 We later found warfarin w dosag unknown us 14 day wafarin treatment fell caus fall unknown accord friend walk right next mom stop walk forward drop floor hit back head she consciou mobil initi repeat brain CT scan hospit day due drop gcn the second CT scan shown much larger bleed due blood thin effect warfarin she becam semiconsci loss sens control left side CT brain result 1 acut subarachnoid subdur haemorrhag 2 pneumocephalu occipit bone fractur left haemotympanum blood product sphenoid sinu 3 haemorrhag contus left occipit lobe old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleu her inr 35 due warfarin luckili extens rehab abl regain 90 physic mental abil she discharg 911 the blood test sept 14 visit cardiologist haematolog within rang platelet clump note biochemistri non fast within rang non clinic signific On follow visit neurologist leg check neurologist indic doe tendenc embol and brain CT scan done sept discharg hospit show blood clot brain almost gone unlik alzheim her BP 11012080 rang she 3 BP medic one stomach 1 amlodipin besil 10 mg 2 lisinopril 20 mg3 atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 20 mg stomach On 928 cardiologist resum warfarin 1 mgday start despit request leav trial switch aspirin when request echocardiogram dr respons WE need TO DO A transesophag echocardiogram A mildli invas procedur TO detect clot reliabl which IS not feasibl howev even IF NO clot wa seen the risk for clot format IS still present do AN echocardiogram will not chang manag with question 1 given patient neardeath bleed safe continu bloodthin therapi We famili favor use aspirin therapi AF mitig risk thromboembol oppos continu warfarin but given near death brainble use warfarin wise use ani blood thinner even low dose aspirin 2 should patient echocardiogram determin natur extent clot ismay form due AF what type echocardiogram transthorac transesophag what test see upper chamber mother heart help us determin extent build clot therefor help us form evalu true risk profil embol event due AF
1382,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I recently got my blood tests back and am not sure if I have ""Heart Disease"" in the classical meaning of the phrase or just a bad reading or ""Bad Numbers"" which need to be addressed. Can someone please clarify this for me? First off; I'm a recently turned 60 year old man who used to be an athletic type during my younger years and over the years let it all go down the drain it seems. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 almost exactly 2 years ago; and also hypertension for the first time. Although my Hypertension was on the low side then the Dr. Still prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg a day for me which I have taken until recently (he upped it my last visit to 40 mg a day predicated on my own readings showing that 20 mg was not enough (he said that even if there was some disparity that 40 mg a day ""wouldn't hurt me' or lower my blood pressure any further and it was ok-and even said I could break the tablets in half after 20 mg and take 10 followed with 10 later if my blood pressure went up again. At that time; 2 years ago he also prescribed 500 Mg of Metformin to be taken twice daily which I have followed to the letter since then; plus 40 mg of Simvastatin or Zocor once a day. I cut the Simvastatin out back in December after having experienced the worst vertigo episode one could imagine-cat scan Dr. ordered at the ER showed no problem like stroke-but the reoccurrence of the vertigo and he prescribed it to probably an inner ear infection or something in that nature. I was prescribed Meclizine for the vertigo if it came back again; which it did (he called it positional vertigo as one position stopped the terrible spinning of the world around me-and the med with some valium did the job..until the next and then the next episode days apart. Then I got on the internet and saw all the horror stories and similar symptoms that Simvastatin caused and stopped taking immediately-Dr. or no Dr’s advice. The vertigo disappeared the next day until 4 months later where I’m back in the ER again and again CAT scan showed ok-but ER Dr. said I did a good thing by eliminating the Simvastatin; citing other problems it could cause besides vertigo down the road. So I took Simvastatin for only 1 ½ years-until the symptoms showed up. My Dr. who is a heart specialist and has been around for a long time was given the ER results and after putting off my visit to him for a long time (ok I don’t like going to the doctor!) realized I needed blood tests done as I was feeling; and still am feeling; absolutely miserable. The results are as follows-just under 2 weeks ago-total cholesterol 199-not bad as it has been worse in the past..but he said my “now” cholesterol reading was not good-somewhere around 274 or 279-my HDL is 25 (has always been bad and fluctuated over the years-highest 38 and never reached that 40 number in this decade); Triglycerides 505 (was over 700 2 years before; got it down with walking and exercise and a fish oil prescription called Lovazo to 180-then back to my unhealthy ways-lot of stress-death in the family and so on-did not help as I have stayed home and secluded for 10 months now-and probably why my vitamin D count according to the Dr. is very very low at 11.6) VLDL is 101; Dr. guesstimates my LDL is around the 140 area due to improper calculation because of high triglycerides; Glucose serum is 116 but the Dr. said because my A1c is 5.4 that’s good as the Metformin is working as it should be. The Dr. made the following changes in my prescription-he finally gave in to my saying that I would NOT take impastation again and prescribed Niaspan 500-wants me to take twice daily if the (“side affects“) improve (improve? “Fahget bout it!”) in a week or so. I read what the side effects are on Niaspan and they are not good at all and I don’t need to go through all that now. He was about to add a new statin to that until he realized that he was giving me too much all at once-as he said later. New Statin down the road (A big Maybe on that one)? I am going to do exactly what I did the last time 2 years ago-sans the impastation-take fish oil omega 3 over the counter-the Dr. said that was ok as long as it did not exceed 4 grams per day-similar to Lovazo-walk and walk and walk; which I did the last time and my lipid results improved dramatically going from about 220 total cholesterol to 167 and my triglycerides dropping from a whopping over 700 to 180 and my HDL going from 27 to 34-some improvement anyway-all in 6 weeks. Then I will tell him I didn’t take the Niaspan (which I believe he suspects I will not take anyway); and after the blood tests see where I am. During the 2 years I had a cat scan done to check on a suspected nodular opacity which was not there as shown incorrectly on the exray (with contrast and one reason I don’t need to go through that horrible toasted sensation all over my body which Niaspan causes plus other side affects). I know this was a long story but since I have not spoken about this and seen the Dr. very rarely in the past 2 years I felt I needed to tell all to the experts on here or people that I consider experts with their vast experience judging from the posts as compared to my limited experience. I’m 5’9 and approx 224 lbs. by the way-and that’s the first thing that is going to go-if I don’t get a heart attack first! Seriously though; wondering if I have “Heart Disease” in the classical meaning of the word (Never asked my Dr. and he’s a bit evasive on such direct questions anyway). Anybody care to help please let me know what you think. I am contributing my 199 total cholesterol to eating a lot healthier these past several months but don’t know what that “now cholesterol” that the Dr. talked about is-as that seemed to be of some concern to him. One last thing-my Dr. made me feel great before I left his office when I asked him what my chances of getting a heart attack were now and he should me this rectangular plastic thing where I saw little lego miniature type blocks-very little and then this block as big as the Washington Monument next to them (that’s me he said insofar as my chances of getting a heart attack) and a slightly taller lego type next to that.

1387,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi. I am a 20 year old female that has had palpitations for 5 years. My father was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and died following a heart transplant in 1993. I am a college soccer player and had been running 20-25 miles a week along with weight training. My palpitations have worsened slightly over the past year and I occasionally get light-headed in the mornings so I went in for a check-up. I had echo's done in 97 and 99 that were unremarkable. (Though they did show a mild to moderate leak of the aortic valve.) My recent echo showed an ejection fration of 30 with slight LV enlargement. The aortic valve leak was said to be trace. My cardiologist restricted me from strenuous activity and put me on Toprol-XL and Lisinopril and is going to have the echo redone in 3 monthes; and I am going back to see him in one month. He said I had some atrial fib during the echo and my heart rate fluctuated between 70-155 bpm. (I could feel palpitations during the echo). I have no symptoms during exersize and my palpitations only bother me at rest. My questions are: 1. Is this something that medication could possibly fix; or am I looking at deteriorateing health and no longer running/playing soccer again? 2. Should I be looking for a second opinion?

1391,Lisinopril+hypertension,Anxiety by edayvol; 5 minutes ago In Nov of 08 I found myself in emergency room 3 times due to headaches; chest pain and the feeling of passing out.. At that time my BP was 200/95... I've had EKGs; CScans w contrast; chest xrays; MRI of brain; lumbar puncture; Halter Monitor in last 1 1/2 yrs... They first diagnosed me w Migrains which the meds made me worse and useless.. Next diagnosis was and still is anxiety.. They first put me on clonazapam and lexapro. I was on that for about 3 mths.. I ran out of clonazapam and they would not refill w/o a visit and had a nasty withdrawal.. I decided to taper off both to get myself clear of all meds.. Took about a month.. After off meds I still had occassional chest pain and headaches going up the left side of my shoulder and neck to left side head..

1392,Lisinopril+hypertension,Nov of 08 I found myself in emergency room 3 times due to headaches; chest pain and the feeling of passing out.. At that time my BP was 200/95... I've had EKGs; CScans w contrast; chest xrays; MRI of brain; lumbar puncture; Halter Monitor in last 1 1/2 yrs... They first diagnosed me w Migrains which the meds made me worse and useless..

I ran out of clonazapam and they would not refill w/o a visit and had a nasty withdrawal.. I decided to taper off both to get myself clear of all meds.. Took about a month..

1394,Lisinopril+hypertension,"A few days ago I was sitting reading and watching tv when I felt this strange sensation of moderate uncomfortableness/mild pain in the right top of my head. It was enough to make me flinch and be concerned but there was no severe pain. It seemed to me like it might be located under the scalp vs deep inside my head. The sensation seemed to be two separate but closely parallel pulsating streaks like lightening. This lasted only a few seconds then went away. I didn't have a headache; didn't notice any faintness; dizzyness; weakness or change in vision that I could tell. The next day I noticed a steady mild discomfort seemed to be present in my scalp/head alongside the temple just in front of my right ear. My ear seemed to feel some discomfort in it; almost as if I was getting an earache (which I didn't really get) and a feeling of fullness; this feeling also continued on behind the lower point of the jaw joint and down into my neck; like where one might feel discomfort from a swollen gland. Today this sensation still exists and the skin of my face on the right in this same general area feels just ever so slightly numb and tingly; like the very beginning sensation you start to get after receiving a novacane shot. If I turn my head far to the right I can feel the uncomfortable feeling near my temple/ear and neck more. I also have some mild pain if I press moderately hard on the spot on my head that originally had the ""lightning like"" flashes of discomfort. The same is said if I press on the areas where I feel the discomfort along the temple/ear/neck. Could this be caused by some sort of plaque breaking loose and traveling through an auricular vein? I have not seen the doctor for this yet. I have an appointment on the 18th this month for my 6 month check up for Diabetes type 2; at my last check I was found to now be in the ""prediabetic"" range. I am taking Metformin 500 mg once a day; and Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 once a day for hypertension. My blood pressure has been in the nornal to high normal range but lately I have been under a lot of stress. I am 41; 5'7"" and 305 lbs.

1395,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am looking for suggestions with regard to ""lifestyle changes"" (diet; etc.) for people with hypoactive thyroid. For several years I have had a practice of walking an average of two to three miles per day; sometimes more. I eat very little salt and eat more fish and chicken than red meat. PMD recently prescribed Armour Thyroid 60 mg. in the AM due to TSH of 4.88. Selected lab results are below. I read here on the ""Armour Health Page"" the suggestion that the medication be taken sublingually rather than swallowed. Neither my MD nor my pharmacist mentioned this. I take other meds in the morning (Lisinopril; Wellbutrin; Ritalin; baby aspirin (also inhale Advair and Nasonex); and in the PM; Sanctura; Colace; Xanax PRN; and Ambien PRN) all of which I swallow with obvious the exception of the sprays. QUESTION: Is it important to dissolve the Armour Thyroid under my tongue rather than swallowing? QUESTION: I read on the same page that it's good to divide the dose at least 2x per day; to spread the effect. Again; is this an important point? It's not the way my prescription was written. If it's important; I'll discuss it with my MD. Thyroid issue is new to me. QUESTION: Are any of the OTHER meds listed above known to cause thyroid issues or interactions with Armour Thyroid; including possibly impairing systemic absorption? QUESTION: Would grapefruit juice potentiate (increase) or block the effect of Armour Thyroid? Avoid it?

PSA 0 since; Depression since 2003; ADHD first dx 1982; and Hypertension since 2008. My next scheduled MD appointment is next Monday; with a hematologist/oncologist; to assess the platelet clumping; as well as some unexplained bruising; followed by my PMD the following Monday. I was assessed for this once before; in 2005; with negative findings. Clumping at that point in time was attributed to an anticoagulant agent in the test tubes; rather than any medical condition in me. Recent symptoms: In recent months I have gained about 10 lbs.; despite daily walking and moderate diet. I have felt run down and unfocused; despite meds; anxiety; insomnia. Lipid profile (HDL and LDL) has been healthy from 2004 up to the most recent. LDL is now elevated; and HDL low. It's unclear to me whether the platelet clumping and bruising could be related to high TSH; or if it is entirely unrelated. This issue seemed to concern my PMD more than the elevated TSH. Could they be related? Childhood health history positive for mumps; chicken pox; and unconfirmed rheumatic fever. Family history is positive for hyperthyroid (mother); leukemia (paternal grandmother); and heart disease (father and paternal grandfather); and diabetes (paternal grandmother; sister). -- NOT TESTED RECENTLY; BUT PLAN TO DISCUSS WITH MD: Thyroid Antibodies (TPO and TgAb) - Ferritin – B12 - DHEA – Cortisol – VitD – Phosphorus – FSH - -- Any suggestions or advice would be most welcome; with thanks.",2009,2009,50.0,Male,,,I look suggest regard lifestyl chang diet etc peopl hypoact thyroid for sever year I practic walk averag two three mile per day sometim I eat littl salt eat fish chicken red meat pmd recent prescrib armour thyroid 60 mg AM due tsh 488 select lab result I read armour health page suggest medic taken sublingu rather swallow neither MD pharmacist mention I take med morn lisinopril wellbutrin ritalin babi aspirin also inhal advair nasonex PM sanctura colac xanax prn ambien prn I swallow obviou except spray question Is import dissolv armour thyroid tongu rather swallow question I read page good divid dose least 2x per day spread effect again import point it way prescript written If import ill discuss MD thyroid issu new question are other med list known caus thyroid issu interact armour thyroid includ possibl impair system absorpt question would grapefruit juic potenti increas block effect armour thyroid avoid recent lab result tsh 488 uiuml rang 0450 4500 high thyroxin T4 79 ugdl rang 45 120 triiodothyronin T3 135 ngdl rang 85 205 sex horm bind glob serum 24 nmoll rang 1371 free testosteron direct 90 pgml rang 72 240 estradiol 28 pgml rang 0 53 adult male 39 low ldl 115 mgdl rang 099 high ldlhdl radio 30 rang 036 calcium serum 92 mmoll 93 122009 rang 85106 sodium serum 139 mmoll 212009 103 122009 rang 135145 glucos serum 71 fast rang 65 99 fast 114 122009 fast white blood count 98 212009 120 122009 high rang 4511 red blood count 474 212009 508 122009 rang 476 hemoglobin 143 212009 149 122009 rang 135175 platelet unabl perform adequ platelet count due platelet clump 212009 clump 122009 rang 150400 hematolog comment differenti verifi slight anisocytosi red blood cell unequ size poikilocytosi presenc blood poikilocyt few larg platelet observ unabl perform accur platelet count due platelet clump platelet appear adequ slide I prostat cancer rrp 112006 psa 0 sinc depress sinc 2003 adhd first dx 1982 hypertens sinc 2008 My next schedul MD appoint next monday hematologistoncologist assess platelet clump well unexplain bruis follow pmd follow monday I assess 2005 neg find clump point time attribut anticoagul agent test tube rather medic condit recent symptom In recent month I gain 10 lb despit daili walk moder diet I felt run unfocus despit med anxieti insomnia lipid profil hdl ldl healthi 2004 recent ldl elev hdl low it unclear whether platelet clump bruis could relat high tsh entir unrel thi issu seem concern pmd elev tsh could relat childhood health histori posit mump chicken pox unconfirm rheumat fever famili histori posit hyperthyroid mother leukemia patern grandmoth heart diseas father patern grandfath diabet patern grandmoth sister not test recent but plan TO discuss with MD thyroid antibodi tpo tgab ferritin b12 dhea cortisol vitd phosphoru fsh ani suggest advic would welcom thank
1396,Lisinopril+hypertension,I caught an std over a year ago; with swollen lymph nodes and and a urethral discharge being the first symptoms. I was treated with cipro; with no results and then went to the ER and was given a shot of rocephin; a 1000 mg of Zithromax and prescribed doxycycline. The discharge went away; and the lymph swelling in my left armpit; left elbow and behind my left knee went down by about 1/3; but stayed swollen and irritated for over a year. I had unprotected sex after that with only one woman for a few months; but I always pulled out and never ejaculated in her. We broke up and I still had the swollen and tender lymph nodes. I never tested positive for anything other than that I had been exposed during my lifetime to EBV; so my nurse practioner assumed I had mono; even though I tested negative on mono spot tests. Now a in March I began having sex with a hooker. She has no teeth. After receiving unprotected oral from her I would then use a condom for vaginal sex with her. I had sex with her like this for 5 weeks; then I took a chance at unprotected sex with her; telling myself that if she had anything I would have probably caught it from her through the oral with her having no teeth. Then a couple of weeks after having unprotected sex I began having an obvious std; with new lymph nodes being tender and swollen like the other ones still were. But with taking the Zithromax the swelling went down in the newly inflamed lymph nodes; and with the rocphin shot and more Zithromax the old swollen lymph nodes show marked reduction in size and irritation; although still inflamed. I am wondering if I could have been carrying this std for over a year; and that I may have been the one to infect the prostitute and then reinfected myself. I do not think this is likely; but there is definitely a reduction in the pain and swelling I have had for the prior year. I am on my way to the E.R. now to see about another shot of rocephin and Zithromax; as the stuff almost went away and is coming back again. I'll post on whether they want me to just let it come back for a couple of weeks so they can get a good swab or if they want to just try to knock it out with aggressive antibiotic therapy; as it responds to Zithromax and rocphin but not to cipro or doxy. I am just curious about my hypothesis if I could have been a carrier with no discharge and infected someone and reinfected myself.,2012,2013,,,,,I caught std year ago swollen lymph node urethr discharg first symptom I treat cipro result went ER given shot rocephin 1000 mg zithromax prescrib doxycyclin the discharg went away lymph swell left armpit left elbow behind left knee went 13 stay swollen irrit year I unprotect sex one woman month I alway pull never ejacul We broke I still swollen tender lymph node I never test posit anyth I expos lifetim ebv nurs praction assum I mono even though I test neg mono spot test now march I began sex hooker she teeth after receiv unprotect oral I would use condom vagin sex I sex like 5 week I took chanc unprotect sex tell anyth I would probabl caught oral teeth then coupl week unprotect sex I began obviou std new lymph node tender swollen like one still but take zithromax swell went newli inflam lymph node rocphin shot zithromax old swollen lymph node show mark reduct size irrit although still inflam I wonder I could carri std year I may one infect prostitut reinfect I think like definit reduct pain swell I prior year I way ER see anoth shot rocephin zithromax stuff almost went away come back ill post whether want let come back coupl week get good swab want tri knock aggress antibiot therapi respond zithromax rocphin cipro doxi I curiou hypothesi I could carrier discharg infect someon reinfect
1397,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been diagnosed with a small 12 mm tumor on my left adrenal gland. Have had so many tests and they've all come back negative for a pheochromocytoma; yet I have so many symptoms of one. I'm also going thru menopause and many of the symptoms are the same; like sweating; nausea; insomnia; anxiety; heart palpitations; weight loss; but the worst one is blood pressure spikes. I've been to so many doctors and they keep testing or referring me to other doctors. Seen cardiologists; endocrinologists; kidney doc; internal doc. Seems like they all have a different opinion; some say my symptoms must be menopause; others say it may be a pheo. Now I need to wait until November to have another MRI to see if it has grown. This has been going on for almost a year and I am having a hard time handling all these symptoms. I can put up with menopause; but when my bp spikes to nearly 200/100 plus; it gets really scary. Just wondering if anyone has any information on adrenal tumors. I'd hate to have surgery to get my adrenal gland removed when all along the problem was menopause!

1398,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

1399,Lisinopril+hypertension,My father went to a doctor about his high blood pressure last year and got put on benecar with a diuretic. That made him very dizzy (but brought down his BP right away) so they put him on plain benecar (no diuretic); which still helped his BP; but still made him dizzy. Eventually he started taking only 1/2 a pill a day; which still controlled his BP and still made him dizzy. Recently; he decided that he couldn't handle the dizziness anymore so he went off of the meds entirely (w/o telling anyone). He got a stomach flu the following week; his BP went way up again (170/100) and he went to the doctor. the doctor gave him bystolic to try.. to see if the side effects would be any more manageable for him. he has been on it for 3 days now and his BP has changed from 170/100 to 155/110 to 150/117 today... so the top # is going down; but the bottom # is going up... and I'm worried. My parents want to give it another day or so because they think that he might have been dehydrated from his sickness and that could have made his body retain water and now that he's not as sick; he's still retaining water and maybe it'll adjust itself over the next day or so of not being sick.. But.. I'm worried. does anyone know anything about this? I asked a friend of mine who is a family practicioner and he was.. very alarmed and thought that my father should be hospitalized for severe hypertension... which; i told my parents and they basically told me to shut up :-P Realistically; I'm hoping that nothing terrible is happening to him because he's feeling Ok.. but I'm scared.

I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52.0,Female,,,ill tri write novel get point Im healthi woman 52 yr I health issu healthi heart chad score 0 BP nice low 10060 dont smoke drink anymor big trigger etc etc after ablat pvc I develop afib I wonder high profil cardiologist boston perform ablat He put flecainid work 75mgday 50mgday metoprolol It work first blip but I start frighten episod svt brought ER eventu hospit He took flecainid seem caus svt I also atrial flutter I cardiovers still afib heart rate high Im event monitor report doctor heart rate 150 last night I slept He put 100mg metoprolol ill take 2nd dose 50mg minut He want brand name toprol XL pharmaci hard time stock right Im regular extend releas version take pm OK done background here issu ive onlin read page page page peopl taken side effect dosag report scare tear everyth hair thin huge weight gain Im somewhat overweight last thing I need sleepless extrem exhaust depress sweat zero libido worsen afib goe honestli Im upset frighten I knew I shouldnt gone onlin read stuff I Im shock preval advers side effect I feel like Im go becom chronic unhealthi person begin end healthi year Oh one thing I read imposs lose weight metoprolol slow heart unabl burn fat even ton work thi stink soon monitor come I plan start work lose excess weight I went ER heart rate 200 BP still perfect I told kind phenomen heart muscl obvious strong Id like keep way ani thought
1401,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47.0,Male,,,I 47 year old male athlet unfortun 4 month ago I heart attackmi left ventricl arteri 100 occlud 2 regular metal stent place left arteri It big shock everybodi especi sinc cholesterol 170 time even heart attack blood pressur 12480 plu genet nobodi die heart attack among rel I eat fri fast food diet gener ok My pain never stop I experienc constant chest pressur short breath doctor pay attent He say etiolog pain known shouldnt anyth cardiac sinc stress test oklast month I end emerg room restenosi one stent clog 99 anoth stent place top two thi time xienc 5 drug elut stent went top two the doctor start pay littl attent even apolog listen mesinc thenit month I continu experi problem everi day I pain doesnt matter I exercis sit offic the pain may start middl chest move right left goe backupp part shoulder right breast bone hurt sometim tender touch befor I heart attack I never experienc anyth like everyth start stent place ani suggest comment greatli appreci I function normal I hope stem cell scienc advanc much faster anticip bring new avenu hope peopl like us
1402,Lisinopril+hypertension,Three weeks ago I had ablation for AV node reentry; and two other sites as well for atrial tachy and extrabeats. Ep said he got it all. Two weeks ago was put on a Loop monitor and my EP said he seen one atrial tachy 16 beats total and a number of sinus tachy; one up to 120bpm and a number of pac's. Well;last nite around 3am I was awakened from a sound sleep with the worst attach ever;even before ablation. I recorded and sent it in. It was beating at 160bpm+ at times with a few missed beats and was unrelenting. They said it looked like Sinus Tachy. The center told me to call my hospital which I did. The doc asked what I had on hand to take. I had an 80mg fast act Verapamil and 240sr Verapamil. I took the 80 and it slowed the heart rate down to the high 80's. Then took the 240mg. My HB is around 75 this am but it took 1 1/2 hours to get there. This no longer sounds like a normal variant of ablation does it? Also; I am to go on 50 mg Toprol 1xday after speaking with EP's office this am. and was told I could take the fast acting verapamil if it got untolerable as well as the Toprol. Can I mix Toprol with Verapamil? I took pinadole (spelling)one time prior to alation and it made my heart beat fast so was told to quit. Will the Toprol work better? What Could this sinus tachy be from. I don't have any other problems that I know of. Could this be a onetime thing due to post ablation? Can a persons heart beat that fast and long with no bad effects? Also; my bp is naturally low 112/58 usually. Can I still tolerate Toprol?

1404,Lisinopril+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

They had me on pletal for severe pain in legs(calf) when walking. Pletal caused my pulse to stay above 112; BP to elevate and generally made me feel out of breath. The Cardiac dr ordered some tests and blood work. Then they call; almost in a panic telling me to stop the pletal. I already had the day before after seeing my reg dr. Then they call back at different times telling me my Echo was abnormal; some blood work was abnormal and then to say the stress test was abnormal; showing some blockage in cornary arteries.

1406,Lisinopril+hypertension,"My boss was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and blocked arteries several months ago. He is also a diabetic. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery 4 months ago. He went to all his post operative appointments and progressed normally except for an infection at the site on his leg where the vein was removed for the bypass. He has no insurance; and has cancelled subsequent appointments; such as a repeat heart echo that was scheduled; because of financial problems. His wife asked me to post a question and see if we could get some responses and some information. His chest; where his ribs were spread for the bypass; is sort of concaved in; and she is concerned about this. She feels that he went back to work too soon after the surgery and pushes himself too much; lifts too much; etc. To a certain degree; from my observations; she's right. He is just a very ""controlling"" individual and has to have everything his way. He simply refuses to admit that he has limits and he feels that his body is rebelling against him.

1408,Lisinopril+hypertension,"About 5 years ago; I hit leg and got cellulitis. A year fighting this caused toxic shock (septicemia) and an emergency admission to the hospital. Five days of central line antibiotics; 4 different kinds; and 3 courses of it at home; and I was 'cured'. For two weeks after getting out of the hospital; I felt fantastic. Then... everything fell apart. My body failed me at every turn. Was tested for every autoimmune; because they said symptoms were 'classic autoimmune'; but all were negative. Two rheumatologists dismissed me. Went through 4 docs in 2 years. TSH; after 3 months taking 1.25mcg levothyroxine; was 18.9. I'm currently taking 2.75mcg levo morning & .75mcg levo afternoon. Pain; swelling; fluid retention; nausea (vomiting); trembling; spasticity; tenderness to touch; insomnia coupled with severe and debilitating fatigue; inability to concentrate; and more... all still there. They treated with antidepressants; told me I was depressed; said maybe it was fibromyalgia; or a ‘pain syndrome’. Then we got an unexpected break: I was bit by a brown recluse (fiddleback spider). I broke out in a systemic rash. PA gave a shot of steroids. For almost a week; I felt pretty good. I moved to the Houston/Galveston area; and the PA I'm seeing here gave me a steroid shot for inflammation; and the same thing happened. About five days without pain and w/more energy. She wondered about Addison's. She gave an injection and prescription for prednisone 5mg; twice per day. Later; she increased it to 10mg; twice per day. She then scheduled a 24-urine coritsol-it was low-normal. I didn't know to avoid caffeine or that steroids could affect the results. This test was invalid. I had gained almost 60 pounds in fluid water weight; over a three-day weekend period. She freaked out and sent me for an abdomen CT. Results normal. The endocrinologist retested 24-hour urine cortisol. This time; we took the test the right way; with no caffeine; no steroids (had to work off them and stay off them for two weeks to get the test done; and that was tough.) This time; my 24-urine cortisol was low-it was 3; with him saying 5 was low-normal; and that it could account for pain and fatigue; because the body wasn’t healing well; but he mostly blew it off and said it wasn't 'low enough' to cause problems. He also said that the fact I had GAINED weight contraindicated diagnosis; since adrenal insufficiency; particularly Addison’s (or primary AI) usually presents with weight loss and anorexia. I had gained a LOT of weight; super fast. When I insisted steroids made me feel better; and that matched w/low steroid tests; he agreed to an ACTH stimulation test. Endo retested 24-hour cortisol & free cortisol; and results were low again; and that prompted him to order an ACTH stimulation test (Cortrosyn; with cortisol at baseline; 30 and 60). Stim test started at 8am. Baseline cortisol was 4 (not a typo-it was 3.6; to be exact)–was told at hospital it should have been at least 15; preferably 20-25). 30 minute draw was 12 and 60 minutes was 15. Even after stimulation; I didn't get up to ‘low normal’. Doctor called; said; ""You failed the test...we need to get you on steroids."" He said he was surprised I wasn’t in the hospital—I told him I’ve felt so bad for so long; I didn’t know what was worth going to the hospital for. I had told the truth when I said there were days I literally could not pull myself up physically out of bed. I have tried to find anyone w/numbers as low; to see what dosages were prescribed. I also can’t find anyone’s ACTH stim test that responded the way mine did. I did triple (more than) my baseline; which I've read could be indicative of pituitary showing not enough ACTH to stimulate adrenals to normal levels. Even triple baseline; it was not low-normal. I don't know if that matters. Pain & symptoms came back next day. Because I am overweight; not underweight; and anorexia is a symptom of this condition; doctor told me he didn't think I'd fail; he was surprised I had failed; but he began throwing things at me: take a triple dose if I get sick; call him if I have to triple dose; get a medic alert bracelet and a card; get an emergency syringe dosage in case I'm found unconscious...that's a lot to throw at someone he thought didn't even have this condition. Put me on hydrocortisone; 20mg-morning; 10mg-afternoon; 5mg-early evening. It helped; but pain & fatigue was still there; and I was still puking and unable to eat more than a few bites; but was still gaining weight. In the evenings; the pain was bad. He did another 24-hour urine cortisol; while on hydrocortisone; and I was still a 3... a little bit higher; 3.6 this time; so almost a 4; but still low; even with what appears to be high doses of hydrocortisone. He switched me to dexamethasone; .75 in the morning and hydrocortisone 10mg in the afternoon. He wants to retest urine cortisol in August; but also said to call and let him know if I'm feeling better. He has no tests ordered and no appointment scheduled until August. I've been on dexamethasone for a week now. It's helping. Fluid is greatly reduce (though I'm peeing like crazy!); I'm more active; pain is reduced (no pain in the morning after dosing; but pain comes back in the late-afternoon; early evening); sleeping better; eating better too; less nausea. But symptoms haven’t gone away... does it take time for the steroids to make me feel better? Am I dealing with something else that's being missed? I'm curious why he didn't test ACTH levels at the same time as stim test; because wouldn't that have helped him decide if it was pituitary and/or adrenal; or both? Would that change treatment? They missed this condition for over four years of testing; so I worry that this is secondary to another condition that they are missing; and that my body is just tired from the stress and thus secondary adrenal insufficiency undiagnosed becomes ‘primary’; but the symptoms are for a completely different condition. My FSH; testosterone; estrogen; androgens all normal. I am not in menopause. My thyroid is regulated on the levo; my last TSH was 1.7 (little low; but ok for someone with treated hypothyroidism). Last T3 & T4 tests were a year ago; but were normal on meds. Sodium is normal (I crave salt like you would not believe); potassium has a tendency to go low when on steroids and high when I'm not; but the last two tests were normal readings for me. VitD and folates are normal. Since I have two endocrine issues controlled by pituitary: adrenal insufficiency & hypothyroidism(and suspected but not confirmed diabetes insipidus–but not diabetes (blood sugar is fine or sometimes low); seems to indicate there IS an HPA-axis thing going on. This correlates w/high-dose antibiotics I took in the hospital damaging the pituitary or the septic shock and infection destroying the pituitary. Considering I'm still in pain; though improved; and I'm not scheduled to go back until August; what should I do? Are there other tests I should be asking for? I'm self-pay-money isn't major if tests need done; but I can't throw money away. I have no insurance; so no worries w/approvals. I don't want to continue in pain until August if there's other things we can do. Can I expect to continue to improve with the same treatment or does improvement usually come faster? Am I being impatient and should wait for the dexamethasone to work or is the fact that; after a week; I'm still not feeling great an indication of a problem? I know it's a lot to chew on... I don't expect anyone to have all the answers to all my questions... but I'm spinning in circles here; and thought maybe you guys could give me at least a direction to proceed before Aug; so I'm not just sitting around popping pills that might not be helping or could be hurting.

1409,Lisinopril+hypertension,Im an a 27 year old female and I am very worried. For the last month or so I have started getting numbess in my hands while awakeing. I would just rubbed them together and everything was fine. Then it progressed. Rubbing them only made them worse; I would have to hang them over the side of the bed for a while for the blood to ciruclate back into my hands for the pain was incredible. I was having neck pains at the same time; so I assumed that was causing the numbness so I had went to the doctors. I had an ex-ray done and nothing was found abnormal.I know something is wrong with me; so i requested an MRI. The results were negative; so they sent me home. Well; the numbness in my hands have gotten much worse since then. The night before last I had awoken every hour on the hour with my hands feeling like they are on fire. Rubbing them only makes them more painful. I found the only solution to make them stop hurting is to run them under warm water. The pain didn't go away completely but it was enough for me to fall back asleep; just to be awoke an hour later with the same unbearable pain. This morning; I cant sleep at all. It went from an hour to 20 minutes of unbearable pain.so bad I cant stop crying. Warm water is the only cure for the pain; but my hands are still numb and they still hurt. This is affecting my work and my sleep. It is only getting worse and I am very worried. Please tell me what may be wrong with my hands and how I can sleep again without so much pain.,2010,2010,27.0,Female,,,Im 27 year old femal I worri for last month I start get numbess hand awak I would rub togeth everyth fine then progress rub made wors I would hang side bed blood cirucl back hand pain incred I neck pain time I assum caus numb I went doctor I exray done noth found abnormali know someth wrong request mri the result neg sent home well numb hand gotten much wors sinc the night last I awoken everi hour hour hand feel like fire rub make pain I found solut make stop hurt run warm water the pain didnt go away complet enough fall back asleep awok hour later unbear pain thi morn I cant sleep It went hour 20 minut unbear painso bad I cant stop cri warm water cure pain hand still numb still hurt thi affect work sleep It get wors I worri pleas tell may wrong hand I sleep without much pain

1411,Lisinopril+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this?,2008,2008,,,,,for past sever year I notic eat food rang cup milk full meal heart rate blood pressur increas significantli 30 minut eat last one 12 hour two hour thi occur 50 time eat My heart rate goe 75 bpm 140 bmp max todat blood pressur goe 13080 180102 max date note I borderlin hypertens take 20mg lisinopril day I attempt determin particular type food food addit might trigger symptom notic symptom alway occur I eat peanut butter snack cracker sold vend machin occassion happen I eat homemad macroni chees other food I find relationship I cup milk one morn get symptom cup next day gallon symptom I sever test hospit stress test sonogram heart gastronom test result Of cours test conduct eat I exhibit symptom Do thought might caus
1412,Lisinopril+hypertension,Warm greetings; and many thanks for your valuable time. I'm a 38 year-old female; former runner and mother of three. I've enjoyed good health until a recent pregnancy when I began experiencing unprecedented chest pain; SOB and palps. Multiple work-ups later; including an adenosine cath; I was diagnosed with endothelial dysfunction (coronary flow 2.5); and aortic sclerosis with insufficiency (1.6 and 2+). I take Lisinopril; Eplerenone; Pravachol; Advair and sublingual nitro as needed. I continue to feel periods of chest discomfort with pressure; (relieved by rest or nitro); breathlessness and fatigue after prolonged exertion or extreme emotional stress. I've heard different opinions on my prognosis and treatment plan. 1) What is endothelial dysfunction; a marker for atherosclerosis; heart failure or another disease entity? How common is it? 2) Is small vessel disease reversible; and what is the current research on treating it? What causes it? (I do not have diabetes but did have gestational diabetes). 3) Given that the valve disease is only mild-moderate; would an AVR help cure my symptoms? Isn't valve replacement indicated when INDIVIDUALS become symptomatic? 4) Two weeks ago after a sudden death in my family; my siblings and I discovered that we have Factor V Leiden. Would you consider this an incidental finding; or relevant in terms of my treatment; diagnosis; future caths; etc. 5) I also have mild LAD stenosis from a myocardial bridge. Could these factors combined explain my symptoms or alter my treatment strategy?

1413,Lisinopril+hypertension,This started last year. I woke up extremely dizzy; headache and had trouble speaking. Lasted about 4 hours. My eyes were not reacting to light. Months later; while at work I would be sitting and get dizzy out of clear blue. Co-workers often said I was slurring my words; which I was not aware of. Lately I have been waking up dizzy at least 4 times a week; lasting now two weeks. I am nauseated; feel pressure in back of my head; balance is quite off; blurred vision. I have had an MRI; which was normal; A stress EKG; where the EKG was non-conclusive; and the scan showed okay. I have Hasimotos disease; High Blood pressure; extreme Vitamin D defiency; and am taking 50;000ui daily; to have blood checked on June 29th. I currently take Lisinopril 20-25; Atenolol 50; Synthroid ;175; and I have sleep apnea; a Herniated lumbar disk at L3/L4-5. I have involuntary muscle spasms that affect mostly upper body; but sometimes lower extremities as well. I go back to doctor on 29th; and I need to know what to ask for in the way of more testing; because this is beginning to interfere in my daily activities. I am also a smoker and trying like hell to quit; and need to lose about 100 lbs. Any helpful insights would be appreciated. thanks; Karen,2010,2010,56.0,Female,,,thi start last year I woke extrem dizzi headach troubl speak last 4 hour My eye react light month later work I would sit get dizzi clear blue cowork often said I slur word I awar late I wake dizzi least 4 time week last two week I nauseat feel pressur back head balanc quit blur vision I mri normal A stress ekg ekg nonconclus scan show okay I hasimoto diseas high blood pressur extrem vitamin D defienc take 50000ui daili blood check june 29th I current take lisinopril 2025 atenolol 50 synthroid 175 I sleep apnea herniat lumbar disk l3l45 I involuntari muscl spasm affect mostli upper bodi sometim lower extrem well I go back doctor 29th I need know ask way test begin interfer daili activ I also smoker tri like hell quit need lose 100 lb ani help insight would appreci thank karen
1414,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Before 2/4 2007; I had been an extremely healthy woman for 45yrs. I was 4'10""; 110lbs & had worked since I was 11. In 2004; I was dx w/hypertension & for 3 years my BP was regulated w/Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25mg & Norvasc 5mg; & I was feeling great. In 12/2006 my insurance co 'recomended' I switch from Norvasc to Lotrel; because it was the same & my copay would be $25 instead of $50; so my doctor called it in. While out watching the Superbowl I suddenly got sick; disoriented; & collapsed. When I got to the ER my BP was 56/48; 3hr later after a bag of fluids & w/a splitting rt side headache & horrible nausea I was discharged w/a BP of 84/56 & told I was overmedicated. Later I found out that the Lotrel dose was 40/5mg; because it actually contained an Ace Inhibitor; like the Lisinopril; as well as the calcium channel blocker thatNorvasc contained. My dosage of ACE inhibitors went from 20mg to 60mg. My Insurance co then cancelled me. My symptoms have progressed over the last 3 yrs to being diagnosed w/Mild to Severve Brain damage Global Cognitive Disfunction; aphasia; speech & memory problems; right side tremors of my rt arm & leg now progressing to my left; dx as Ataxia & probable Dystonia; chronic daily migraines & nausea; w/unequal pupils & photosensitivity in my rt eye now progressing to my left dx as Blephorspasm & Meige Sindrome; Dysautonomia & Vasovagal sympathy w/frequent syncopy events sometimes while just sitting down; Endocrine problems ie thyroid not working; & I stopped having periods & was told I was in menopause. In 9/2009; I was told its been over a year now since your last period; you've completed 'the change'; but over the last couple months have started to have severe bleeding & cramping. Recent blood work is showing I've completed menopause as they thought; but now there are indications of liver problems & muscle wasting & I've gained 35lbs; Chronic GI problems; diarreah & constipation; I have no BP or temperature control & frequently just start emitting heat (no sweating); & twitching; Tachycardia where during my tilt table test my BP went to 117/22; & was told that was normal; at my last neurology appt in Sept; my BP was 180/72 & my temp was 95. He said he wasn't concerned; thought that alot of my symptoms were probably psychogenic due to the 'trauma I believed I had experienced' from the overdose & its affect on my life; but that he wasn't sure about all of them. He gave me samples of Cimbalta & said I should undergo psychotherapy. My next appt is in May; his first opening. All I want are answers to what actually happenned to my brain & body. Out of 6 Drs/Specialist; NOT ONE will relate it to the hypotensive event. They just say odd case; but there's no way my symptoms are related to it; but that its interesting that they all started after 2/4/07. They deflect even my basic questions & had one laugh when I asked about neuronal damage from lack of oxygen & told maybe I shouldn't read so much into my symptoms When I asked for an EEG; he said he didn't see the point. I've been unable to work for the past 3 years & was just denied again for Social Security. I have worked since 1973; & was pre-vet at UC Davis where I worked in large animal ICU & radiology; then a vet tech & practice manager for over 25yrs; so I'm not medically ignorant to basic facts of science & medicine; but I'm not a Dr. Why can't I just get some straight forward answers as to the what happens to your brain & body after a trauma like this like a flowchart of sequence to hypoxia; & what long term effects of medication toxcicity could be happening. ACE inhibitor overdosing ""has never really been studied except to say that an overdose could cause hypotension"". I'm interested in any info; advice; hypothesis; thoughts anything. I'm willing to be a guinea pig for a Dr; just as long as they're actully interested.

1415,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I have an update to the question below that I posted awhile back. I'm updating this in the event someone else is searching for answers to a similar issue. The culprit of my shortness of breath was not the warfarin to treat the DVT in my right leg...it was two blocked coronary arteries! Four days ago; I had an angiogram that quickly became an angioplasty with stent placements into two arteries that were 99-percent and 80-percent blocked. The procedure entered into the artery of my right wrist; not the groin. I was in the hospital about 30-hours and walked out without any assistance or major concerns. Today; I completed a 20 mile bike ride and can't believe how effortless the bike ride was. Thanks to CCFheartMD11 for your spot on response to my concern. My ego seemed to have gotten in the way of the obvious signs of an impending heart attack. Now when I look back at the last few months; walking 4 miles in the snow to get to work....feeling the upper chest discomfort...I kick myself in the arse for doing such a bone headed thing. Now; I take seven pills a day. Aspirin and Effient (expensive!) to keep the platelets from clotting; especially with the new stents. Lisinopril to control hypertension and Metoprolol to treat angina and improve survival after a heart attack. Simvastatin to control bad cholesterol and triglycerides. And of course; one 80 mg chewable baby aspirin a day. I take the Effient; Lisinopril and Metoprolol in the AM. In the PM; I take Simvastatin; aspirin; Warfarin; and Metoprolol (twice a day). I'm still taking the warfarin for the DVT issues. Now I look at the long road ahead as I combat my heart disease. The stenting buys me time to correct and modify my lifestyle to take into account genetic factors and dietary factors that led to my clogged arteries. Of note; I've not eaten egg yokes; milk fat; and have avoided saturated meats for the last 20-years. Those steps taken years ago may be why I'm alive today and not from a sudden death event. My diet will undergo even more severe elimination of food groups. Most of my protein is derived from egg whites; beans; and the occasional chicken anyway. Here is my older post: Dear Medical Experts: Brief background: I'm 48; 6'-1""; 250lbs; body fat around 22 percent (waist minus neck size). Health issues: During March '10; steep ramp up of monthly bicycling mileage from 240 miles to 700 miles left me with sciatic nerve issues the result in my opinion of the piriformis muscle contacting the sciatic nerve. After the second attack; sought treatment at a spinal sports med clinic. During this period; traveled to Australia from US Pacific Coast. Two months after Australia trip and six weeks after epidural injection; began cycling conditioning on stationary bike. Stretching after a stationary bike exercise session released clot that caught behind my right knee. Scan of legs showed old clots and new clots in upper right thigh and lower leg. Begin treatment for DVT: heparin until Warfarin build up in blood with INR 2.5. This brings me to now. I'm still taking Warfarin. Recently; I've noticed an increase in upper chest discomfort during stationary bike exercises. The discomfort begins about 10 minutes into a warm up session. I slow down enough for the discomfort to go subside and keep efforts on the low side to avoid having that pain. Once into the cycling session; I can increase efforts; but can feel that level upper chest discomfort. Now and then; just before it's time to take the Warfarin meds; I notice an irregular heart beat; say; every sixth beat is slightly delayed. Warfarin brochures indicate irregular heart beat and upper chest discomfort as possible side effects. Last week at three month checkup; discussed upper chest pain; CT scan conducted that day. Waiting to be scheduled for stress test. Does my situation sound like blocked arteries OR side effects to be expected from Warfarin treatment? I'm beginning to think the sciatic nerve issues and DVT issues may be unrelated to the recent upper chest discomfort and that I may have blocked arteries. Any thoughts?

1416,Lisinopril+hypertension,My current issues – Head sensations in clusters (top; sides; and back of head); back pain/aches; bone aches in thighs; calves; and fingers; rushing sound in left ear at night or in quiet room; and pressure in rear sometime entire head. Have CT; MRA; and ENT Specialist scheduled in next two weeks. Am worried about underlying issues even as recently prescribed medications are dulling the sensations; aches; and pains. My recent history is below. Background – 44 year old male; 5’10”; 210lbs. 24 years in military; retired 3 years ago however remained active and in gym 4-5 days per week. Strength workouts on machines and 20-30 minute endurance workouts on treadmill and elliptical machines alternating days. Healthy diet of High Fiber; Fruits; Vegetables; Chicken and Fish during weekdays. Lean meat (pork/beef on weekend). Non-Smoker but drink beer in moderation Fridays and Saturdays. Government Manager/Executive with work behind computer and various meetings throughout week. History of Asthma and Allergies x25yrs however controllable without attacks (Meds – Advair Diskus; Claritin; & Flonase). Family history of heart problems – prescribed pre-hypertension meds in 2006; changed to Lisinopril (20mg) in 2010. Diagnosed six months ago with Chronic Epidetimitis. Meds for 90 days only. Occasional flare ups with aches in right side of groin area. For the past year each time I bend down to tie shoes I feel pressure my head. Past three months have had rushing sound in my left ear main when lying down to sleep. Also noticed when I shower that when washing/grazing my inner thighs I felt tenderness or slight pain but only in this fashion. No other pains when sitting; walking; etc. Additionally; recent drainage and dry voice side effects with Flonase. Also noticed increased blood pressure (135/85). In recent months my body has felt drained after daily workouts. My treadmill runs reduced to 20+ minutes at 10 minutes per mile pace. On 1 March 11; I approached fitness coordinator who gave me new interval program to rev-up my metabolism and energy. Run sessions consisted of walk; jog; run (2min each x 30 minute total) and one day of slow hill run; both on treadmill. Off days on elliptical. Initial reaction to increased speed periods during workouts is minor pain in both sides of kidney area. Not sure if muscular/skeletal or internal however run through pain which went away. After two weeks of sessions one night felt slight pressure in head after cooling down at home. Ignored and went about my usual activity. On 15 Mar 11 decided to see my doctor and gave him update of all recent symptoms. Doctor listened to heart; carotid arteries; and conducted EKG (all OK) and scheduled a stress test. Changed Flonase to Nasonex and added additional 10mg Lisinopril – now 30mg). Discussed aging as cause of potential tinnitus in left ear. Continued to conducted regular gym workouts. Two days later (17 Mar 11) I awoke with left rear temporal lobe; upper neck sensations/aches; and increased pressure in ears. Went to clinic and seen by other doctor who conducted series of hands on exams with my head (vision; ears; puffed out checks; pressure; etc.). Doctor diagnosed no emergency however scheduled ENT specialty appt; CT; and MRA. Next day (18 Mar 11) while driving home began having unusual sensations in my head that moved around. Not much pain however on the top left side; then right side; etc. Took some Tylenol which helped. Throughout weekend had same sensations and used Tylenol occasionally. Monday morning (21 Mar 11) while driving back to work sensations began again. Took Tylenol which helped. Worked out in evening. Tuesday morning (22 Mar 11) awoke with head sensations; back pain and spasms throughout the day. Went to doctor on same day and described symptoms. Another EKG (all OK) and prescribed Butalbital-Apap-Caffeine. Chem 7 Labs ordered. Decided not to workout this day and took one pill (Butalbital) in evening. Woke next day (23 Mar 11) without any pain however as day went on back aches and spasms; head sensations set in. Blood drawn in morning and provided results (all normal) in afternoon. Did not go to gym. Noticed spike in BP that night (145/87) with no symptoms and sleep. Woke next day (24 Mar 11) without any pain however after getting up and moving around back aches; bones aches in thighs; calves; shins set in. Noticed aches getting worse while sitting in office computer chair. Took Butalbital however this only dulled the aches. I can feel the underlying pressure in back of head and in body. Same situation on Friday (25 Mar 11). Took medication with same dulling sensations in head; back and body.

1422,Lisinopril+hypertension,Maybe a more productive way to look at post-tx issues and how we might best be able to return to a healthy; symptom-free life is this: It might be a good idea to find out what our forum members have been doing to overcome any post-tx problems they have encountered. Many of us have described problems with depression; pain; mental fogginess; lack of motivation; fatigue; neuropathy; sun sensitivity; rashes; etc. after ending therapy. Rather than try to assign a specific cause to these problems; which always seems to provoke an uproar; let's just discuss how we might overcome these problems; and begin to regain our health. If any of our members have experiences that they wish to relate; regarding their post-tx challenges; and how they have coped; or are coping; this would be a great opportunity to share those insights. This also might provide an opportunity to see a cross section of the forum; and understand how they are feeling and functioning after completing therapy. Please let us know whether you are SVR; or still have the virus. Personally; I am trying to avoid lots of direct sun exposure (I now get a Lupus-like reaction). I use Restasis for the dry and inflamed eyes; and it seems to be working after almost one year of use. I try to get extra sleep each day; and find I feel somewhat more energetic most of those days. I still do fall into unexplained bouts of lethargy; not really depression; but just lack of motivation. I do not feel the drive that I did before tx; or during tx; and often continue to feel spacey.

Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. How does medicine help control high blood pressure? For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Doctor and Poster: What is NSAIDS?

1427,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Russert's untimely death raises questions about how we're treating heart disease Dear Friend; You won't hear me say this often about anyone in mainstream media; but T. Russert; newsman and anchor of Meet the Press; was someone I respected. I took great joy in watching politicians squirm under his tough questioning. So; like most Americans; I was sad to hear the tragic news of his sudden death. After all; Russert was just 58 years old — relatively young by today's standards. According to his doctors; he had diabetes; heart disease; and he was overweight. Yet without fail; every time I hear a news story or read an article on his death; the commentators express their surprise that something like this could happen to someone who was on blood pressure pills and cholesterol drugs; who exercised routinely (in fact; he worked out on the treadmill the morning he died); and who was on a diet. He'd even recently passed a stress test. I wish I could say I was shocked by this news. Unfortunately; stories like this one only highlight what I've been telling you all along: Blood pressure doesn't cause heart disease; high cholesterol drugs aren't cure-alls; and exercise can do more harm than good. In short; none of the steps Russert's doctors told him to take to address his health concerns were doing a darn bit of good. Instead; if someone had told him to focus on keeping his homocysteine levels low and his magnesium levels high; we might not be having this conversation in the first place. Homocysteine makes cholesterol stick to your artery walls and can also contribute the hardening of your arteries. It's simple to control your cholesterol levels by loading up on B vitamins; like B6; B12 and folate. Magnesium also has vital heart-healthy benefits. ""Statins don't protect against heart attacks. And [Russert] didn't know that the lack of one nutrient could have cost him his life;"" said acclaimed neurosurgeon Dr. R. B. ""The number-one cause of sudden cardiac death is magnesium deficiency. Cardiac patients and those with diabetes have the lowest magnesium levels of all."" I've written to you before about the many benefits of magnesium. This mineral prevents blood clots; dilates blood vessels; and can also stop the development of dangerous heart irregularities. It's why I've been such a long-time advocate of increasing magnesium intake for its heart-health benefits – not to mention what it does for your bones and bodily tissues. I've even used magnesium in emergency medicine to help limit brain damage in stroke victims. And yet more than half of Americans have a magnesium deficiency. ""People who are deficient in magnesium are most likely to have sudden cardiac arrest; and when they do arrest; they are harder to resuscitate;""DR. B. says. ""Many simply can't be resuscitated."" Dr. S. B. surgeon in chief of New York's M. Medical Center; did a good job of summing up just why the death of the beloved newsman has so shaken both Americans in general and doctors in particular: ""It makes us all feel mortal; and it also highlights the natural history of this silent killer and our limited ability to catch this killer before it strikes.""

1429,Lisinopril+hypertension,"They come; they go. One month exercise causes them; the next month exercise is the only time they don't pester me. For months I could predict ovulation to the DAY just by the palpitation pattern. Now; there's no discernable pattern at all. I'm a person who needs to know how things tick. It's more curiosity than anxiety. It's a drive; a need to know. I took apart all my toys as a kid because I wasn't just content to play with something; I had to know the mechanics of it. Why does the doll talk? Why does the car go when you wind it backward and let go? How do the wheels on this thing stay on it? And this is exactly the same. SOMETHING causes these PACs. While we all know the traditional triggers; something is changing that makes us more prone to them. WHAT!!? A combination? No; because I could have HALF the usual combination and I feel this way; or the entire puzzle and have no symptoms at all. It seems a few of us developed atrial arrhythmias after having children. Clearly; this isn't limited to people who have cardiovascular problems in pregnancy (PPCM; pre-eclampsia; etc.); in fact I think most of the women who develop palpitations afterward have otherwise very normal hearts. So what is it about pregnancy that does it? Hormones? Cardiac structural changes? Are there different states similar to pregnancy that bring about new PACs and SVTs for people? Is it all in the hormones? Is it autoimmune? Is there an inflammatory process? Is it somehow environmental? I'd be interested in how it stacks up statistically too; for instance; how symptomatic are people in the northern US versus the southern US? And east and west too; for that matter. Does time of year make a difference? And are all the things that ""help"" also just coincidences of timing? It's enough to keep a researcher happily busy for a very long time. You know what I'd like? I'd like enough money to go to medical school. I'd go into cardiology/electrophysiology and would devote my career to searching for the answers to the questions that keep us up at night.

1430,Lisinopril+hypertension,"48 y/o nonsmoking slightly overweight female. Low total chol (144) and good hdl. Mild hypertension on Lisinopril and HCTZ. No other meds. 2-3 years ago had a stress test and stress echo after very mild bout of what I thought was minor chest pain; all ok at that time. I've pretty much dismissed any thoughts of problems since then. Couple weeks ago while driving was hit with intense sternal chest burning/pressure that was so painful I felt I might pass out; but didn't. A burning ""flush"" type pain went up my throat to the lower part of my face. It took about 15 min for symptoms to abate while I contemplated calling 911. I chalked it up to bad heartburn and thought I'd go to the doc if it happened again. Last week; it happened again while I was simply sitting down. Not quite as intense; but exactly the same severe burning in my chest; with the weird flush/burning up my throat to my lower face. This time; it only lasted 6-7 min and wasn't quite as bad. I didn't go to the doctor. I feel as though I would be very low risk for any cardiac blockage; due to my low cholesterol; nonsmoking etc. Someone at work mentioned it could be an esophageal spasm. I hate to be an alarmist; in light of the good stress testing a couple years ago and low risk status. What is your take on this? Should I to to the doc and have another stress test? This happened at rest both times. I have zero problems during strenuous activities. Or just take a wait and see approach? I don't generally ever have heartburn; but I suppose it could be reflux.

1432,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I am a 70 year old male; and have been in A Fib for the past two months. In addition a echocardiogram has shown damage to my heart muscle. I have hypothyroidism (essentially no thyroid function) and have been taking Thyroxin (full replacement for the past 25 years. I am currently taking digoxin; lisinopril; cardevilol; coumadin; and occasionally lasix. The cardiologist I have been seeing (I have only seen him twice; and will not see him again since he is leaving my HMO) has precsribed amiodarone-presumably as a means of possibly restoring my normal sinus rythym. What I have read about amiodarone on the internet; and elsewhere - patients taking it should be closely monitored. This makes me a little reluctant to start taking this drug- at least until I see my new cardiologist. At the moment no appointment has been set up; and judging from previous experience-it could take several weeks for this to happen. In spite of all this; I feel pretty good. Some informed advice would really be appreciated. Howard -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Howard; Thank you for your question. Amiodarone is a good medication for controlling afib; but as you know has many potential side effects. You will need good follow-up while you are on it - particularly with regard to adjusting other medications such as digoxin which may be affected by the amiodarone. I have enclosed some general information about afib. As far as specific treatment options you will need to discuss with your cardiologist. *************** Atrial fibrillation Definition: A disorder of heart rate and rhythm in which the upper heart chambers (atria) are stimulated to contract in a very rapid and/or disorganized manner; this usually also affects contraction of the ventricles. Causes; incidence; and risk factors: Arrhythmias are caused by a disruption of the normal functioning of the electrical conduction system of the heart. Normally; the atria and ventricles contract in a coordinated manner. In atrial fibrillation and flutter; the atria are stimulated to contract very quickly. This results in ineffective and uncoordinated contraction of the atria. The impulses may be transmitted to the ventricles in an irregular fashion; or only some of the impulses may be transmitted. This causes the ventricles to beat more rapidly than normal; resulting in a rapid or irregular pulse. The ventricles may fail to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. Causes of atrial fibrillation and flutter include dysfunction of the sinus node (the ""natural pacemaker"" of the heart) and a number of heart and lung disorders including coronary artery disease; rheumatic heart disease; mitral valve disorders; pericarditis; and others. Hyperthyroidism; hypertension; and other diseases can cause arrhythmias; as can recent heavy alcohol use (binge drinking). Some cases have no identifiable cause. Atrial flutter is most often associated with a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or surgery on the heart. Atrial fibrillation or flutter affects about 5 out of 1000 people. It can affect either sex. Atrial fibrillation is very common in the elderly; but it can occur in persons of any age. Prevention: Follow the health care provider's recommendations for the treatment of underlying disorders. Avoid binge drinking. Symptoms: sensation of feeling heart beat (palpitations) pulse may feel rapid; racing; pounding; fluttering; pulse may feel regular or irregular dizziness; lightheadedness fainting confusion fatigue shortness of breath breathing difficulty; lying down sensation of tightness in the chest Note: Symptoms may begin and/or stop suddenly. Signs and tests: Listening with a stethoscope (auscultation) of the heart shows a rapid or irregular rhythm. The pulse may feel rapid or irregular. The normal heart rate is 60 to 100; but in atrial fibrillation/flutter the heart rate may be 100 to 175. Blood pressure may be normal or low. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring--Holter monitor (24 hour test)-- may be necessary because the condition is often sporadic (sudden beginning and ending of episodes of the arrhythmia). Tests to determine the cause may include: an echocardiogram a coronary angiography (rarely) an exercise treadmill ECG Treatment: Treatment varies depending on the cause of the atrial fibrillation or flutter. Medication may include digitalis or other medications that slow the heart beat or that slow conduction of the impulse to the ventricles. Electrical cardioversion may be required to convert the arrhythmia to normal (sinus) rhythm. Expectations (prognosis): The disorder is usually controllable with treatment. Atrial fibrillation may become a chronic condition. Atrial flutter is usually a short-term problem. Complications: incomplete emptying of the atria which can reduce the amount of blood the heart can pump emboli to the brain (stroke) or elsewhere--rare Calling your health care provider: Call your health care provider if symptoms indicate atrial fibrillation or flutter may be present. The links below are good sources of information about atrial fibrillation. http://www.med-edu.com/patient/arrhythmia/atrial-fib.html http://www.americanheart.org/Heart_and_Stroke_A_Z_Guide/afib.html http://www.merck.com/!!vDXoe16kTvDXpz08Of/pubs/mmanual_home/chapt16.htm I hope you find this information useful.

1434,Lisinopril+hypertension,"Hi; my name is Marcie. My husband is the one with a GI problem and we have no diagnosis after numerous tests. His signs and symptoms are right and left lower quadrant abdominal constant pain. The pain gets worse at times and diminishes at times. He states his pain is stabbing and constant. Nothing really makes it feel better or worse; except lying in the fetal position. He also has about 6-15 bowel movements a day depending on how he feels. His stool has been loose and watery for about 7 weeks; but now is softer and formed; sometimes black in color and sometimes light brown. He constantly feels like he has to have a bowel movement and cannot go anywhere or function with his activities of daily living because of it. He has lost about 20 pounds within four weeks without trying. He also suffers from nausea; belching; and blood; fat; and mucus in stool; and abdominal cramping. Other symptoms at times is chest tightness; body aches; waking up in middle of the night to defecate; blurry vision; fevers that come and go (max. 102.0 degrees F); flushing to face; and difficulty breathing. He also feels weak and has had loss of appetite. He is depressed because he cannot function in life without a toilet nearby. His medical history includes Hypertension controlled with Lisinopril and HCTZ; chronic sinus infections; and 7 years ago (age 23) his left arm became paralyzed with no explanation by the doctors. He regained feeling and strength to his arm after a year of rehab. He is 30 years old now. We saw a family doctor who tested his stool for Ova and parasites and did blood work on him on October 20; 2010 with all results being reported normal. We were referred to a Gi doctor who performed a colonoscopy on Nov.12th; 2010 with a diagnosis of ""nonspecific colitis."" The doctor states ""a possible carcinoid tumor was observed around the appendix and also stated the appendiceal orifice appeared somewhat unusual with wide mouth and mucosal changes."" The doctor also stated; ""Terminal ileum was slightly friable and mildly congested; throughout the colon; there appeared to be some nonspecific edema and congestion and mild erythema."" Biopsies were taken from the colonoscopy. The microscopic description states the "" the appendiceal orifice; the terminal ileum; and the right colon show an unusual amount of lymphoid tissue with no well defined germinal centers. The biopsy from the appendiceal orifice and terminal ileum were sent off for further immunohistochemical analysis to exclude a lymphoproliferative disorder; which came back benign; and suggestive of chrons disease. A small bowel series was performed on 12/03/2010 to rule out chrons disease and what a surprise; it came back normal. This doctor referred us to get a CT scan done of the Abdomen and Pelvis with IV and oral contrast to check for carcinoid tumors; which was done 11/17/2010. The results of this exam stated only a mildly fatty liver with the impression of a ""grossly stable abdomen."" Furthermore; we were referred to the cancer center to rule out carcinoid tumor. He was tested for 5-HIAA in a 24 hr urine collection; cbc; cmp; chromogranin A panel; clostridrium in stool; gastrin level in blood; LDH; Ova and parasites in stool; Retic count; and serotonin blood level; as well as campylobacter; salmonella; shingella panel in stool samples. All of these are to rule out carcinoid tumors; and they all came back negative. We have a follow up appointment with this GI doctor and will see what is suggested next to rule out this rare disorder. We don't know what to do. We will probably get a second opinion; but really can't afford it. Our life is on hold because of his illness which; I’m afraid; is not going to be diagnosed. He has been on Asacol medication since November 8th and is not feeling any better. We are afraid this is not going to be diagnosed and may be a mystery diagnosis; which he cannot go on living this way. If you can suggest any other ideas; rare diagnosis; or anything at all; we would greatly appreciate it.

1435,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hi I have read that a lot of people get palpitations. I have suffered from them over the past few years as well as suffer from anxiety and panic attacks (which are fairly well controlled now). I have just recently finished having a 24 hour moniter; ECG (EKG); Stress test and Echocardiogram. The only thing that showed up on any of them was the 24 hour halter moniter....it showed that I was having rare PVC's and PAC's.My problem is that over the last two days I now get palpitations when ever I lay down from standing....I have even had a couple when I have sat down quickly. I took myself to ED (ER)this morning as it is freaking me out. I have never had them before when I lay down. Of course they did not catch any and said they are benign but it really has me worried. Why all of a sudden would this develop. I am a 38 year old female. I have my period at the moment but never had these with any other period.

1436,Lisinopril+hypertension,"After 2 years on thyroid meds; I would think I would be in a better place. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and hypothyroid about 2 years ago and most of the time I still have had horrible symptoms - both hyper & hypo. I am now concerned that I have Secondary Hypothyroid instead of Central because my TSH has always been low with a low Free T3. Last week these labs were taken by my PCP because of high blood pressure - after seeing the results; he sent me to my Endo. PCP Lab Results last week: TSH: 0.32 Range: 0.34 - 4.00 Free T3: 2.59 Range: 2.50 - 3.90 Free T4: 0.84 Range: 0.58 - 1.64 So; I went to my Endo (who only ran TSH) and she told me I was in the Normal Range and I was where I need to be - end of discussion. ENDO's Lab Results this week: TSH: 0.365 Range: 0.34 - 4.00 My symptoms are high blood pressure; constant anxiety; heart palpitations; weight gain; depression; puffy upper eyelids; low blood sugar and always tired. So; as you can see - I'm having both hyper and hypo symptoms! All I know is that I feel horrible - not myself at all. I've been told to take Xanax for the anxiety; but I feel that is covering up a physical issue so I don't want to. Doctor put me on Lexapro for depression - I'm up to 30 mg a day (higher than normal dose) and don't feel better. I'm concerned that the problem is with my Pituitary since with a low TSH - I'm still in the Low-Normal range of Free T3 - even though I take T3 every day (I also take T4). Am I totally off-base here? My Endo makes me think so. I'm 58 and can't imagine feeling this way for the rest of my life. A little background - I had 5 miscarriages in my 20's; always have been hypoglycemic; problem with depression since my teens; I've always been lethargic - so; I believe I may have had undiagnosed hypothyroid most my life. I was also told recently by my doctor that I am ""cured"" of Hashimoto's since my antibodies were below range. I'm so frustrated and confused... anyone have any ideas?

1437,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have had anxiety ever since I can remember and I had my first panic attack at age 11. Throughout my life; I have become obsessively worried about various things - first it was nuclear war; then the world coming to an end (these worries were going on when I was a kid); then it became my health. I have been obsessed with the belief that I have a heart arrhythmia that is going to kill me for a long time now; I started fearing this because I have heart palpitations which doctors and cardiologists have all told me aren't dangerous and there is nothing wrong with me. It got to the point about 2 years ago when my heart was all I thought about; all day every day. I almost failed out of a top 10 college and my life was miserable. I went through an intensive therapy for health anxiety and got better for a while but now I'm getting bad again. I am starting to think and worry about my heart 24/7 and I have massive; horrible headaches; too (probably from the stress and worry). I have been offered every medication under the sun by too many psychiatrists to count; but I am scared of taking anything but a beta blocker and Xanax. What can I do? I can't afford to go thru therapy again right now - plus it didn't help all that much to begin with. I am TERRIFIED of the thought of taking an SSRI - I'm scared of the weight gain and the heart palpitations it may cause.

1440,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I had my cardiology appt ; consulatation today for first time and now I am more confused than ever. Why is it that dr.s can not agree on tests results; etc? After my apparent heart attack early April; Severe squeezing pain to mid chest; pain to jaw; sweating; nausea; rise in blood pressure; feeling faint; feeling of impending doom; lasted about 15 minutes; went home.not to E.R. ( big mistake.) has stress test May 12; 08 Test was given a Persantine injection ; since I can not use the tread mill; allso radioactive dye to take pictures of heart. The test showed what is called REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT; THE REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT N THE INFEROSEPTAL REGION AND THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOKINESIS OF THE SEPTUM AND INFERIOR SPETUM NEAR CARDIAC APEX. AND MID CARDIAC SEGMENT. THIS AREA DOES NOT PERFUSE NORMALLY ON STRESS IMAGING;. THE SIGNIFICENCE OF A PARADOXICAL PERFUSION DEFECT VARIES BUT THIS CONDITION MAY OCCUR WITH A RECENT MI. PARTICUARY AFTER REVASCULARIZATION OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.CLINICAL CORRELATION IS ADVISED. My dr. accepted this as the result of my chest pain episode in april; all the classic symp. of a MI. The dr. forums here; Clevleand Clinic advised that is sounds as if I did indeed have a MI; though mayby a lilttle one; and that I would possibly need an echocardigram with left heart catherization and hopefully the Myocardium was only stunned and still alive. Now the Cardiologist I saw today didnt neccesary think the same thing; he said there are lots of reasons for Chest pain; but could not specify one; ( I don't have heartburn; indigestion; panic attacks; pleurisy; pneumonia; chest muscle pain or pulled muscle; gallstones or stomache pain; these are the obvious ones. ) I think one thing that threw him off was the fact that my chest pain episodes do not have any particualr pattern; and occur at any time of the day without exercise stressors. I get squeezing tightness in chest; burning pain in my throat; shortness of breath; nausea ; faint feeling; rise in blood pressure and heart rate; and fear. Need to sit down. The nurse even said; ' don't call them Angina."" I don't know what else to call them as I have never had them before this MI ( feeling...) in April. I can not predict when they will occur. The nurse allso considered my blood pressure of 148/84 ( normal and good ) after taking my blood pressure pill????Anyway; the dr. decided to do the Cardiac Catherization to rule out once and for all what I have or don't have going on with my heart. Are all dr. s this hard to get an opinion ; why do dr. s disagree so much? Has anyone else out there had a reverse Perfusion Defect on their Stress test? I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to think. Is it allways so hard to diagnose problems like this? If I would have gone to the E.R. I would not be having this problem now. There is a part of me that wishes I would have an attack in front of a dr. so I can get a diagnosis. It should not be like that.

1444,Lisinopril+hypertension,I have been considering purchasing a Resperate; a biofeedback device that costs about $300 and -- according to some fairly impressive clinical studies -- is effective in significantly reducing BP in something like 70-75% of those who try it (or more). Well-controlled studies appear to have been done; the comnpany seems quite reputable; etc. But I sure would like to hear independently from some folks who've successfully (or unsuccessfully) tried this device before spending the money. Just yesterday I learned of a competing device; also around $300; called the Zona Plus. Works on a completely different principle; ALSO seems well tested with an interesting history (it emerged from jet fighter technology). It frankly sounds a bit easier to use; and they claim it is effective in over 90% of patients; and with a better result to boot. But it is available ONLY from the manufacturer -- Google produces almost no hits on it. The scientific papers they cite seem; mostly; generic rather than specifically about the Zona Plus itself.

I have few allergies - Texas Mountain Cedar; cat dander; molds; but they typically present as respiratory or sinus complications; not dermatological. I have an intolerance (not allergy) for ibuprophen; which caused me to have accute renal insufficiency several years ago (high levels of creatinine and BUN). I am a 60 year-old; non-smoking female in very good health. I do have managed hypertension. I take three medications: Premarin .625; Lisinopril-HCTZ 10/12.5; and Paxil 30 mg.

1447,Lisinopril+hypertension,My father had quadruple heart by-pass surgery a month and 1/2 ago. He still hasn't fully recovered. He has been a diabetic since he turned 52. He is now 67 years old. He has repeatedly had fluid around his lung that has been drained off by his heart doctor; but it keeps coming back. He has trouble breathing and every time this procedure is done; he has more and more liquid drained from his lung. The first time it was 1200 ccs. The second time 2800 ccs. He had it drained again today; and my mother told me that there was even more fluid. My father says that he has trouble breathing and feels like he is drowning in all this fluid. My father has had alot happen in a year's time. He had total right knee replacement surgery in April 06; eye surgery on his one and only eye in April 07 - the other eye is a glass eye due to an old coal mine accident 39 years ago - and a month or so ago this quadruple heart bypass surgery. My thinking is that he is too weak to get rid of this fluid on his own. The doctor said that the next time this happens; my dad will be admitted into the hospital for a couple of days for a procedure where the doctor will drain off the fluid again then put some sort of sealent around the lung so it won't fill up again? (I'm not sure if I'm wording this properly.) I guess; my question is why didn't the doctor do this before now? Is it a risky procedure? Why is the fluid amount getting larger and larger every time?

1448,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello; I have been dealing with this problem for 2 months now. My head feels as though I have high fever; but my body does not have a fever; I have taken my temperature numerous times without any indication of heat. Normally it is around 98.4 degrees. I have two points on my head that are painful to touch; however when I place a hot bottle of water on those points; the heat on my head is alleviated for a brief period of time; usually 3-5 minutes. Also once I remove the bottle of hot water I begin to experience headaches. Often I have a dizzy feeling after any type of labor. I also have the pain isolated to the left side of my head. When I use the hot tub; my forehead stops feeling hot; and I have general relief; but this stops within 5 minutes of leaving the hot tub; and my head heats back up again. I also notice some floaters in my vision; however an eye doctor ruled out anything suspicious. I recently had a CT scan which came back negative for tumors or other brain abnormalities. I have a history of circulation problems; and I often have cold feet and hands. In addition I have a scoliosis; but my back is not more then 15 degrees of curvature at any one point. I believe that I may have severe circulation problems and as a result decreased blood flow to the head and the warming feelings associated with that.,2008,2008,,,,,hello I deal problem 2 month My head feel though I high fever bodi fever I taken temperatur numer time without indic heat normal around 984 degre I two point head pain touch howev I place hot bottl water point heat head allevi brief period time usual 35 minut also I remov bottl hot water I begin experi headach often I dizzi feel type labor I also pain isol left side head when I use hot tub forehead stop feel hot I gener relief stop within 5 minut leav hot tub head heat back I also notic floater vision howev eye doctor rule anyth suspici I recent CT scan came back neg tumor brain abnorm I histori circul problem I often cold feet hand In addit I scoliosi back 15 degre curvatur one point I believ I may sever circul problem result decreas blood flow head warm feel associ

I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal.

It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times.

1452,Lisinopril+hypertension,I am a 38 yr old female. About a year ago I started to experience a very strange feeling that occurs periodically when I move from a sitting to a standing position and start to walk. The sensation is as if my head and neck are throbbing with pressure and I have to stop walking or slow down and stop and stand still for a minute or so to make the sensation stop. Sounds are muffled in rhythm with the pulsations and I sometimes feel as if I will pass out; but never have. There is no pain. I have been checked throughly by my GP; a cardiologist; and an electrophysiologist and none of them could find a cause. It does seem to happen sometimes when I am hungry and have missed a meal or eaten later than usual. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

1454,Lisinopril+hypertension,"I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying ""well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous"" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this.

Also; when I scratch them; more tiny blisters will develop around the original blister; signifying an infection. These broken blisters often leave (little open sores) which can be difficult and slow to heal. These outbreaks seem to come in waves; as I'll often go weeks or even a month or two without a sign of blisters; itching; or infection.

1466,Lisinopril+hypertension,I saw another post about atrial fibrillation and stomach gas possible association or connection. I too have the same thing so it may not be all in your head if your suspect this to be the case. Most dr.'s think your crazy or never heard of this when you even suggest it. Thats whats wrong with most dr's atleast in my experience in that they don't think outside the box enough possibly because this is what they learned. I think I/we can guess or prognose just as well or better than they can at times particularly if we know something about health and or ourselves and our own health. Never be afraid to speak up because I feel strongly that digestive tract problems are real and translate into other real nasty symptoms like this. Fortunately we can prevent much of this & need to prevent it from happening. I do feel the more you get afib the worse it can become either physically; emmotionally or both no matter what the cause. I thought up until now that I may have been the first to discover this but would like to know if anyone else has any real answers to this as being a connection? I would like to know how many people feel that they get atrial fibrillation and feel that it may be related to gas or full; bloated stomach; intestinal or digestive tract troubles etc? Isn't it possible that the gas; bloat; perhaps inflamed digestive or intestinal tract can disturb the vagus nerve thereby possibly causing you to go into an afib attack? Any real dr's out there any more with some real info about this? Even conjecture? Any way I also would be interested in what anyone might have to say about it and or what they may have learned from this? If you know or even think this to be the case for you I would also like to correspond with you to trade stories and info on what you''ve learned and done. Be well.

1467,Lisinopril+hypertension,Hello. Yesterday my doctor suggested I might have Laryngeal Spasms; and while I wait 2 months for the Throat specialist to get my appointment; she suggested I look online. But my symptoms don't seem to match all of yours...no voice problems or 'breathing' problems. I just get these violent coughing attacks that literally feel and behave as if I inhaled a bread crumb; and my body suddenly and violently is trying to cough it up. And just like when we are choking; I have a hard time catching my breath during these violent choking fits. By the time I'm done 4-8 minutes later; I'm shaking; tears streaming down my face; and I've probably wet myself. Its horrible! Does this sound familiar to anyone? Oh; and this happens at all hours of the day and night; and usually; its not when I'm eating. Its frightening to wake up from a deep sleep choking like this. She suggested curbing any reflux I might be having; but I rarely ever have heartburn (but I'll try anything now!) I do note that it happens more often when my respiratory system is weakened by a cold; or allergy season; or even a little cough. I'm thinking she might be in the right ballpark; but not the right diagnosis.

1469,Lisinopril+hypertension,I was really hoping for a suggestion as to why I may have developed an indentation in the top of my head. At first I thought I was crazy; and that it was impossible for that to happen; but over the last few months it seems to have grown and now anyone who feels the top of my head can easily feel it. It scares me; especially since my husband had brain surgery less than 2 years ago- (symptoms completely different of course) I am 35 years old; the only time I remember hitting my head really hard is when I was in elementary school and I fell and hit my head on a tile floor. I have had a history of passing out and having seizures but the doctors never figured out for sure what caused it and it hasn't happened for a few years.

1471,Nadolol+hypertension,I've been researching all week. Nadolol has me dizzy; slowing me down. I have been arguing w/ Dr. about when I can reduce. Bandings are going well. Next one in August. I'm terrified of bleeding out again. That ER and ICU situation made a huge impact on me. I worked out some; and then reading about rebleeds slowed me down again. Triple digit heat index reminds me to be patient and stay inside. Yoga is great; but I wanna walk or ride my bike. I know we all deal w/ the fear. It's hard to calm your mind w/ meds; lack of exercise; and statistics that shed light on a harsh reality. Bottom line: I don't like not having control. I thought I would get it back after tx. Do you all find that the mental game is almost as hard as the physical one? My hgb is 12.1. It's going up on it's own since finishing tx. Platelets are 61 which is 1/2 of pre tx. ALT/AST and absolute are good as is albumin. My one kidney keeps plugging away and all functions are fine. So I guess that sums it up. Numbers are getting better. I have to adjust to living with Nadolol and threat of varices bleeds. I supposed to keep pulse between 60-80. Sigh. Thanks for listening and feedback. I didn't feel so much at home at hep c forum once I finished tx. Not the people; just that the frequent posters could not all identify w/ my concerns. Hopefully others who are hit with the reality of living with cirhossis (especially hep c post tx) will find their way here. We still need support.

1472,Nadolol+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

1473,Nadolol+hypertension,Yes; I'm still alive. Dr. banded 5 more varices the day after school was out. He wants to band 4 or 5 more times at the rate of once a month. It is wearing me out with a 10 day recovery due to esophageal spasm pain plus the liquid or soft diet. This was supposed to be my recovery from tx. wah wah wah. BUT! I'm UND and alive. That's a good thing. I've heard bleed outs will haunt you. True. They took my Nadolol to 60 mg daily. Zones me out; but will reduce liver portal valve pressure. Have others gone brain foggy on it? Will it level out? I've read many of your recent posts. So proud of everyone for hanging in there. I'll say it again: the triple therapy was the pits; but my liver functions are normalizing and I'd start again tomorrow if needed. I wanted time to rest from tx after school was out. I'm dealing w/ anger about varices. But I've heard it can be a real life saver with NO future bleedouts for some. I logged on to look up past posts. I'm on a real computer and am gonna search.

1481,Nadolol+hypertension,"Hi; this is my first time posting. I am so confused; angry; tired and in so much pain. First of all; I have portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis. I don't drink AT ALL; even though in Alaska everyone thinks you do if you have liver disease. I have GERD and no mater what I eat; it seems to stay in my stomach forever; until the pain is overwhelming. But a CT scan showed ""nothing"" out of he ordinary. My gastro put me on a course of prednisone before a colonoscopy with disastrous results. My diabetes went nuts; my blood sugar was over 500; my vision was shot and my hands and feet swelled like balloons. I was given insulin injections but my sugars stayed high. The doctor didn't seem overly concerned. I finally flushed the prednisone down the toilet and refused to take it. I have osteoarthritis and can barely walk because of my knees. The doctor finally gave me a painkiller; but it is oxycodone WITHOUT Tylenol because of my liver issues. Well; it says plainly on my charts that I am allergic to codeine! All he said was that it was synthetic codeine. And he won't give me anything else and said to take Advil. At this point I don't know what I should be concentrating on. Weight loss is hampered by other medicatons and I don't eat very much at all. My blood pressure is very good and my A1C is at 6. I am trying to take control of my diabetes again. But I am bloated; swollen; fighting yeast infections and torn ligaments in my knees. I don't know what to do anymore. Would supplements help? Which ones?

Thank you ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dear H.Cooper Your symptoms could be due to side effects of either the nadolol or the clonidine. As you point out; beta blockers can make breathing more difficult in people with underlying lung disease. Either clonidine or nadolol can cause a feeling of fatigue. There are several other potential medications for high blood pressure that you could take. However; neither nadolol nor clonidine should be stopped abruptly - it can be dangerous to do so. Therefore; check with your doctor to see if you can be switched to other medications. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to write back.

My doctor didn't give this treatment plan much credence and she put me on Nadolol only. Are doctors prescribing these two meds and are they effective in the prevention of rebleeding. ____ Dear Lee; Thank you for your question regarding the medical treatment of esophageal varices. Beta blockers; of which nadolol is an example; have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of initial variceal bleeding. These drugs reduce cardiac output and therefore the quanity of blood in the portal circulation. There is evidence that nitrates also reduce portal pressure; by a different mechanism than nadolol. Nitrates act to dilate the mesenteric vessels; lowering the portal pressure. Is the combination more effective than either drug alone? In theory; the combination should be more effective than either drug alone but there is not a lot of published material. Animal studies have shown that nitroglycerin and propranolol (another type of beta blocker) had a greater effect on portal pressure than either drug alone. A human study was published in 1993. This study compared the long term effects of propranolol alone with propranolol combined with a nitrate. The combination lowered the portal pressure to a greater degree than propranolol alone. The combination therapy did not adversely affect renal function although ascites did become worse. This exacerbation of ascites limits enthusiasm for the recommendation of this therapy for all patients with esophageal varices. There is a study that showed the combination of nadolol and isosorbide nitrate was more effective than sclerotherapy. Further work is required to confirm the long term safety and efficacy. This response is being provided for general informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice or consultation.

1485,Nadolol+hypertension,I have recently had an episode of increasing headaches after my neurologist felt it was safe to decrease my diamox by 500mg/month to discontinuation (i had decreased to 500mg BID from 500mg QID). My LP opening pressure at the time of this decision was 21. The increased headaches caused 6 days and nights of absolutely no sleep no matter what I tried (i tried hot baths; relaxing CD's; music; ativan (1-4mg); gravol; benadryl and combinations thereof....all methods that normally work very well on their own). My family physician; concerned; sent me for a neuro consult at the emerg here in town where they did a CT (normal) and an LP...opening pressure varied between 26-21....now it took them 6 tries (junior resident) and I am wondering if it might just not have been an accurate reading? Since then I have experienced an increase in my headaches once again (they had just started to be controlled with nadolol...but i had no rescue med that worked) and am now experiencing what i think must be pulsatile tinnitus (like wind going through my ears two or three times in a row; and a low ring every so often).

He is taking interferon/ribo week 10 but also on apo-nadolol 40mg which is being prescribed for his varicies. I was since then told by the health group that hubby sees that while the nadolol drops his heart rate and pulse so does the ribo/interferon naturally? I did not know this. He is coming home today and the doctor at the hospital reduced apo nadolol from 40 to 20mg.

1493,Nadolol+hypertension,We receieved the biopsy results and they are a little confusing. One doc indicated it was not yet cirrhosis and another said it was early cirrhosis. Both think we may be able to reverse some of this and live a full life. Has anyone had a similar experience or thoughts/experience in interpreting these results? Has anyone had successful regression or reversal? Mild portal chronic inflammation with mile portal interface hepatitis and mile lobular activity. Mild ductualr reaction is noted; bile ducts are preserved. Glycogenated hepatocyte nuclei are present. Trichome stain shows portal fibrosis with bridging fibrous septa that partially enclose nodules.

1497,Nadolol+hypertension,I am a pretty healthy 24 year old male who has gone through a bunch of testing for different reasons over the course of 7 years. It came out that i have POTs and the treatment was 40mgs of nadolol and i was on it for a year and half and basically all my tachycardia is gone and i am no longer on the medication. I never had most of the issues that follow pots i just had some lightheaded or dizziness with tachycardia. ( weeks ago i woke up feeling dizzy and lightheaded i figured it was the change of the weather and didn't think much of it. The feelings continued and i went to my internist at NYU which told me my blood pressure and EKG was fine that my heart rate was in the mid 50sand all my blood was normal. I made a follow up appointment with my EP at Columbia which did a stress test and echo about 6 months ago which was normal no issues. That was wen all was well and i didn't have symptoms. He told me with my recent testing that my office EKG was fine he never heard me sound so good.He ordered a 24 hour holter which he said came back absolutely normal the reading where 45bpm during sleep with mostly 70bpm on average going up to 140bmp during the course of the day. I had no pauses or arrhythmia's. I sent me to the neurologist due to the feelings i was getting was like my body was shutting down and my head felt like it was floating. My arms and legs would get like jello and weak and i just felt like i was in slow motion walking around. I started getting a bloated feeling in my upper stomach that would go into my chest and cause chest pressure and fullness. I have had chest X-ray and mdi of brain and cervical spine all came back normal. I was just wondering if the is could all be related to Pulmonary Hypertension or signs of it since i am starting to get short of breath tacky since i have been off my meds and chest pressure where it feels like I'm not getting enough air at times where it will go away within a hour or so,2014,2014,24.0,Male,,,I pretti healthi 24 year old male gone bunch test differ reason cours 7 year It came pot treatment 40mg nadolol year half basic tachycardia gone longer medic I never issu follow pot lighthead dizzi tachycardia week ago woke feel dizzi lighthead figur chang weather didnt think much the feel continu went internist nyu told blood pressur ekg fine heart rate mid 50sand blood normal I made follow appoint EP columbia stress test echo 6 month ago normal issu that wen well didnt symptom He told recent test offic ekg fine never heard sound goodh order 24 hour holter said came back absolut normal read 45bpm sleep mostli 70bpm averag go 140bmp cours day I paus arrhythmia I sent neurologist due feel get like bodi shut head felt like float My arm leg would get like jello weak felt like slow motion walk around I start get bloat feel upper stomach would go chest caus chest pressur full I chest xray mdi brain cervic spine came back normal I wonder could relat pulmonari hypertens sign sinc start get short breath tacki sinc med chest pressur feel like Im get enough air time go away within hour
1498,Nadolol+hypertension,I have been on nadolol 40 mg for years. My blood pressure has gone down in the last year. I'm on trazodone and have lost almost 30 pounds due to cancer treatment. The doctor reduced my nadolol to 20 mg. a few months ago and recently discontinued it. Six days after stopping it; my legs swelled up. The doctor saw me and I was up 7 lbs from the previous week. He thinks it's a reaction to going of the nadolol or perhaps the tamoxifen (discontinued 1 month ago). The pharmacist didn't agree. I'm also experiencing heart pounding (had this somewhat before this) and my pulse is up. My pulse has been 96 beat per minute at rest. During my workout; where it's usually 108; it is now 156. I was down 30 pounds before and tried to stop the nadolol and my heart rate went up as well. Should I be concerned about this? I feel maybe the trazodone is the thing that has caused my b.p. to drop; not the weight loss.

1499,Nadolol+hypertension,I just went through and completed 12 weeks of harvoni to cure hep c. I had to have 3 bands put on non-bleeding varices in esophagus. How to slowly decrease dosage of carvedilol used to stop/prevent more esophageal varices? I took 6.25 tablet twice a day for 10 days and heart bpm was really low at 39. My uppuer cheekbones swollen (eyes appear sunken); so I then reduced dosage to 5 mg twice a day for 8 days BUT HEART RATE is STILL 39 bpm. Yesterday I again reduced dosage to 3.125 mg twice a day. They want my heart rate to be around 60 bpm as the goal. QUESTION: 1. Is my dosage decrease plan safe enough (slow enough) to prevent danger from too quick of a withdrawl? 2. If this were you ; would you do somthing differently? 3. Do you have any other ideas or hypothetical suggestion?

1501,Nadolol+hypertension,HI! I have been on Verapamil; and gained weight from that. I was also on nadolol; but the heartbeat was still forceful. I asked to go on atenolol (10 mg in the AM and PM) since it helped my mom for the same thing. It is very noticeable and i have a hard time sleeping from this! I recently went to a health and nutrition store...as I read the good effects of Hawthorne Berry on the heart.. I took that; but not at the same time as atenolol. My heartbeat is worse then ever and sooooo strong and uncomfortable! I won't go off the heart meds until I can slowly cut down. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I should do? No insurance becasue of layoffs; so this is hard. Heart tests as of last fall (2008) were normal.

1507,Nadolol+hypertension,My dad was recently diagnosed with severe Cirrhosis of the liver. He is 63 and was never a heavy drinker. We think it may have been caused by metformin he took to treat Diabetes. He also has been self employed and has no insurance; so at this time he is not a candidate for a transplant. He stays cold all of the time and has no energy; yet he is still trying to work due to being denied for disability. He also has an enlarged spleen and very low blood counts and the doctors do not seem to be concerned. The only medicine that he has been prescribed is nadolol. We are not sure what to do for him. He stays so weak. Is there anyone that can give us some advice on medication that we need to request to improve his quality of life? I am a daddy's girl and need him here for a lot longer.

1515,Nadolol+hypertension,Hi there. I would just like to ask a few questions or to perhaps receive some advice about my daily migraines that I have been getting now for 3 months. I am currently on 80 mg of Nadolol as a preventative and although it has definitely decreased the intensity of my migraines the frequency continues to be anywhere between 1-3 a day. They are mild-moderate in pain level; but the pain has really never been the issue for me as much as the other neurological symptoms. I get extreme nausea; vertigo; ear stuffiness; scalp pain; and light/noise sensitivity which i find more debilitating and difficult to live with. I am currently under the care of an excellent doctor at a pain clinic and i do feel like we are making progress; but i can't seem to decrease the frequency of them. I have had a CT scan (normal) and go next week for an MRI. I also take Axert when I can (it makes me sleepy so i usually can only take when I am home). I have also started a pretty intensive regiment of vitamins (vit D; magnesium; calcium) and have recently started 5 HTP (stimulated production of seretonin i believe). All in all I feel like we are trying a number of different possibilities; but I can't understand why i keep getting them several times sometimes per day. I have also eliminated a number of things from my diet; such as aspartame; msg; nuts; etc as well as reduced my caffeine intake. I see an osteopath and acupuncturist. Anyways; just wondering if there was anything we are overlooking or anything you could add to help us? just of note; my dr is reluctant to increase the nadolol because i did have some side effects even at this dose (although ok now) such as low heart rate; low bp; etc. This may not be relevant; but i am a 39 year old female raising three children (with a great husband) and a professional who owns her own business. i have been working on reducing my stress as well.

1517,Nadolol+hypertension,My wife had 2 bleedings (2007 and 2009) due to cirrhosis of the liver. In Feb this yesr her Platel count was 85 and last week it was 87. Her other troubles are; that her right ankle is swollen in the evening ( water) and from her foot up to the knee she has burning pain.

1518,Nadolol+hypertension,I had esophageal varices that they found after going to the hospital vomiting blood. I had been going to a GI doc for a couple of years with stomach cramps and diarrhea and I was told he could not find anything wrong with me. Before the bleed; I had been suffering from fatigue and sometimes I found it hard to keep my eyes open; I mentioned this to my regular doc(actually NP) and I would get talked about my sugar levels and my weight; I had been hardly eating and yet my sugar was around 200-230 all the time. Well; I didn't have my regular doc and the doc on call did a surgical endoscopy and found varices in my esophagus. So she banded them and set up a follow up appt with my regular GI doc. I go to him and he could not tell me why I had them. He did say that the only way he would know was to do a liver biopsy; this was on 9/25. He set up another endoscopy for 12/11. I kept getting sick; and I even developed a intestinal bacterial infection from the hospital. Colds and everything. He was sending me for all kinds of xrays; ultrasound; CT scans; and blood work. On a follow-up visit I was told I had Cirrhosis of the Liver and I had been diagnosed with a Fatty Liver in 1/08. The varices were caused by high portal vein hypertension and I never had high blood pressure before and when I was discarged from the hospital I was taken off the Metrolprolol(for arrythmia) and put on Nadolol. Also Sucralfate and Protonix. Before I had the endoscopy on 12/11 he made a remark that he didn't think I had esophageal varices; which I thought was very odd. Afterwards he told me I had another bleed and he rebanded all the varices from the previous endoscopy. So I did have them. In my follow-up visit of 12/21 he told me that I had to have another endoscopy on 1/8 and scheduled a liver biopsy; finally. After the 1/8 endoscopy he said I had yet another bleed and had to have another one in 4-6 weeks. He did tell me from the blood tests that it looks like I have Autoimmune Hepatitis. Does it usually take this long to have docs to do all of these? It seems that I have a hard time telling him what is my symptoms; like he doesn't want to hear what I say. Should I get another Doctor? There isn't much of a choice where I come from; only two practices of GI docs.

Thanks - susie ** FINDINGS **: The overall echogenicity of the liver is diffusely increased and mildly coarse. The liver is slightly nodular in contour. The liver is normal in size without evidence of suspicious solid focal abnormality. Hepatopetal flow is demonstrated within main portal veins.

The remainder of the abdomen and pelvis were not evaluated. ** IMPRESSION **: No sonographic sign of hepatoma.

1524,Nadolol+hypertension,My husband was diagnosed with cirrhosis in July by liver biopsy. He had been followed with ultrasounds and bloodwork after a surgeon who performed a hernia surgery found an enlarged portal vein last November. The ultrasounds showed a slightly enlarged liver and spleen but no nodules etc. He did have elevated LFTs and low platelets in his bloodwork. He had been a heavy drinker but the cirrhosis was also caused by fatty liver. In the last year he has purposely lost 51 lbs. He eats very healthy now; stopped drinking; is very active and works full time. His MELD score was 15 originally and dropped to 13 in a 3 month period. On Halloween this year; he was admitted to his transplant hospital with bleeding esophageal varices. They were grade 1-2 found on endoscopy after his diagnosis. He had the banding done and is now on meds to decrease portal pressure. His MD said hes not appropriate for the transplant list. Prior to this episode he was diagnosed with compensated mild cirrhosis. His child - Pugh score places him in class a. Since the bleeding; I have been reading that technically he has decompensated cirrhosis. I am a health care professional myself and I'm so scared for his continued health. He doesn't even appear sick. The MD said the cirrhosis was caught early. It's confusing because if it's early then why did he get these bleeding varices that indicate end stage disease? His LFTS are all within the normal ranges now; platelets are 113-123;000 up from 60000; and his bilirubin continues to improve as well. He appears to be compensated based on his bloodwork but not on the bleeding varices. I'm petrified that he's going to need a transplant in the future.

1525,Nadolol+hypertension,"Hi; my name is Susan; I have been the caregiver for my husband who on April 3rd; 2013 presented to the emergency room with mysenteric venous thrombosis with all 3 pathways blocked; mysenteric ischemia; gastric and esophageal varices; alcohol related cirrhosis and portal hypertension. A month prior to this we were living in bliss with no idea of what was to come - no real health problems existed. He was hospitalized for 2 weeks then sent home on Lovenox and told to follow-up with a GI. After being home for 2 days he started having severe abdominal pain and we rushed back to the hospital - they found additional clots - this time in a different circulatory system causing kidney damage in 1 kidney but the other was not damaged but did have clots. He was again hospitalized for 2 weeks and dishcarged on lovenox. Eventually Coummadin was started and within a couple of weeks he started profusely vomitting blood; he was lifeflighted to the hospital where they added Nadolol - said his bleeding was not related to varices but that his portal hypertension had caused the stomach lining to bleed. They took him off all blood thinners and within 2 months returned to the hospital with excruciating abdominal pain - mysenteric venous thrombosis had returned - this time only 2 were blocked. Sent home on Lovenox and Nadolol - this time they added high levels of pain medications to take on a regular basis. My husband and I are both in recovery and have been so for almost 20 years - he has not had a drink this entire time. The pain medications seemed necessary but concerning. Approximately a month later he started throwing up again - back to emergency room - they did a scan and said he had gallstones. They did an ERCP and could find no gallstones? Eventually he stabilized and was sent home - on MORE pain medications. 2-3 days later he started spiking a fever (102-103) - back to Houston Medical Center branch this time - started on multiple antibiotics; had numerous teams yet no one could determine source of infection - thought to be related to the ERCP. Developed hiccups that lasted about 1 month; had 3 spots on his liver; liver biopsy done - no cancer detected but found granulomas; discharged home and by now have too many pain medications. Have a hepatologist and was orginally told that ""Absolutely - I can tell you what is going on and give you a plan of action - shame on those doctors that haven't give you a plan of action."" By the end of the last hospitalization he's scratching his head and saying how unusual his case is an he just doesn't know what is causing all the problems. Was originally told transplant but then was informed that his liver enzymes are still functioning well at times to prevent us from being placed on liver transplant list and they just don't know why he is hurting so much - they refer us to a pain management center. By this point I am beyond frustrated - friend suggested Mayo Clinic in Minnesota can figure out everything - so here we are and the first thing they do is put bands on his esophageal varices - good but I could have gotten that done in Texas. Since being banded he has been hospitalized x 2 for uncontrolled vomitting - he is unable to take the pain medications that everyone has precribed him and now is going into withdrawals. What do they do - add an additional ""Break Through"" pain medication and send him home. I have been told that abdominal pain is a mystery and that he will always have to be on extremely high doses of pain medications - no treatment - no cure. REALLY - can that possibly be true? I'm desperate; tired and extremely frustrated. We are due to go back home tomorrow night - I have 2 children at home that want their daddy back!

What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all?

Today she said that her legs wouldn't work. When diagnosised she had portal hypertension; esophageal varicies and came home with chronic . She is now in a nursing home because she needs more care. Is this an indication that her liver is completely failing. Do I need to have her in the hospital for antibiotic treatments; she has started the lactulose. I am a nurse and my heart is telling me that my mom may not be with me very long. I need to know what I can do and be on top of her plan of care to make the staff and keep the md on top of her treatment. I want her as comfortable as possible. Should I opt for Hospice care for her instead of nursing home. This is gut wrenching watching this horrible disease take my mom away from me. Will this get worse or are there treatments that can help her stablize? I welcome any information you may have or suggest to enable me to care for her the best I can. Thank you.

1541,Nadolol+hypertension,"I was put on hctz 12.5 mg around 2006; but knowing I have severe ""white coat syndrome""; I never took it until I tore some muscles in my upper back and the Dr. insisted I start the med. in May of 07. I have a B/P monitor which checks out against the ones at the Dr.s office; so I was pretty sure my home readings were accurate and they were OK. I was in a great deal of pain from my back injury and PT was making it worse. My personal trainer suggested a med that had helped with a back problem; and my physician sent in a perscription for it. After one dose; I ended up in the ER in the middle of the night with outrageously high B/P. They got that fixed; but it went way up again the next day and I saw another MD who immediately put me on 12.5 mg Atenolol. That was in July of 07. I am 5'2"" tall; weigh 116# and have no cholesterol problems or any other (known) medical problems that simple blood tests would uncover. While on Atenolol I got very out of breath on my daily walks and ; being a SCUBA diver; I had a very scary out of breath episode under water that made me decide to try to get off the Beta blocker. My current MD had me take my regular dose every other day for a week and then stop. The first week after stopping; my energy level was off the charts; but this past week there has been a lot of heart-pounding; rapid heartbeats; soaring B/P from time to time; a rushing sound in my ears that makes me think my B/P is way up and my fears just make it much worse. She said I might have to double up on the hctz if there was a Beta blocker backlash; but I really want to stop those; too. Is there any hope for that and is there anything I can do to help myself through this? I don't smoke; I seldom drink and never more than 1 glass of red wine or 1-2 beers. I exercise regularly; and have cut salt out of my life as much as possible and take vitamins regularly along with cutting out red meat. There is a strong family history of heart problems which none of my Dr's seem to address - most don't even get up from the computer to listen to my heart. I am going on a dive trip in March and I don't want to feel this rotten while out of the country. A little advise would be much appreciated. By the way; I am a 69 yr.old female.

1542,Nadolol+hypertension,Hepatologist suggested my doctor put me on something to control Esophageal Varices; which after a test; were discovered in me. The severity is said to be medium. I've don’t some reading with contradicting beliefs from various doctors and clinical trials. However; all doctors seem to agree that a beta blocker like Atenolol is necessary for a long term use. Just want to know if any of you are on this treatment at 25mg per day. I understand there are some risks; but that the result of lowering blood pressure and heartbeats can help reduce the development of a more serious Varices problem; which in some cases can cause death form unstoppable internal bleeding.

1543,Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 30 year old Type 2 diabetic who was diagonised with NASH and Gilbert's syndrome some 8 years back. A liver biopsy at that time had confirmed the same. I have been living very cautiously since then with hardly any high-calorie intake. Some 3 years back I also developed a gallstone which has been asymptomatic till now. A week back I had been to a gastroenterologist to discuss about the gallstone and if surgical opinion needs to be taken given that it is completely asymptomatic as I am travelling abroad in some days. The doc adcised me to get a fibroscan just for the sake of it because I had been diagonised with NASH & fatty liver. The results of the Fibroscan gave me the shock of my life- the results came up with a 35kpa stiffness. I get my LFT and CBC done regularly and there are no major issues(except for very slightly raised SGPT/SGOT levels- around 10-15 points above normal lvls). I also have no symptoms whatsoever (perfectly reasonable level of energy; good apetite etc). I was advised an endoscopy which I couldnt pursue because of the lack of time but I am extremely scared now because of this. Some guidance on this would be highly appreciated.

1544,Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm dealing with tachycardia arrhytmia since more than 2 years now. My Cardilogist at first said it was dysautonomia and POTS and blame also my severe anxiety and was put on a beta blocker; propranolol 20 mg day. At first it was working on to stop the tachycardia but with time the effect wear off and had to increase my dose and then it was lowering too much my blood pressure so my Cardiologist switch me on another beta blocker... I try several ones; bisoprolol; nadolol; timolol; pindolol; acebutolol... All of those fails to control the tachycardia. In those 2 years; I start having more and more heart related symptoms. Chest pain; jaw pain; left arm pain; exercise intolerance; dizziness; vertigo; intestine problems; low energy physically and mentally... I have severe anxiety (panic with agoraphobia; somatisation; GAD; social anxiety). My anxiety is not well control; I'm med sensitive and can't take antidepressants like Paxil; Lexapro or even older ones like imipramine... 1 mg of Paxil send me to the ER and same for Lexapro; didn't had problem with both drugs before and took them for my anxiety for years. I'm on a high dose of clonazepam 7 mg day; I'm addicted and do a very slow tapering withdrawal... Will take years to get off the clonazepam. I also deal with many panic attacks every day; can't get out th house; can't stay alone; everything trigger heart related symptoms like tachycardia or chest pain; a loud sound; music; too much people's around me... My nervous system seem to be overactive... I'm always sick; have chronic headache; heart is pounding in my chest all the time even when my heart rate is normal; droop of blood pressure or high blood pressure; feeling very hot all the time but can't sweat; can't exercise or just walk cause of my low energy and no physical endurance... I saw my Cardiogist 2 weeks ago; he look at my last holter monitor results and said it was anxiety and said that I may have dysautonomia but probably cause of the anxiety... I was stable on 10 mg x 3 of propranolol day for the last 7 months but the tachycardia was not under control at all... He suggest to RX 25 mg x 2 day of metoprolol. I start taking the metoprolol 2 weeks ago. I feel awful! Not only its not helping the tachycardia; but it make my anxiety worse. I have a migraine with throbbing pain in my head since I start it 2 weeks ago. I have more chest pain and left arm and hand are numb most of the time. My jaw hurt and all my teeth also. I have insomnia; have some vision change; my energy level is even lower than on the propranolol. I also feel depression... The propranolol don't do that... I feel so awful that I decrease the dose to 12.5 mg every 12 hours insistead of 25 mg every 12 hours but even with a lower dose I feel very bad. I'm the only one here who have problems with the metoprolol or brand name lopressor? It's the immediate release one; not the XL... I call my Cardio Doc and ask to be put again on the Propranolol but he don't return my phone call back. The only one beta blocker that I never try is the bystolic; it's new in the Canada but too expensive for me. I also hear that for anxiety it's bad? Well share you're experiences with the metoprolol vs propranolol... It can't be all in my head; I mean the side effects from the metoprolol are horrible...,2013,2013,37.0,Male,,,Hi Im deal tachycardia arrhytmia sinc 2 year My cardilogist first said dysautonomia pot blame also sever anxieti put beta blocker propranolol 20 mg day At first work stop tachycardia time effect wear increas dose lower much blood pressur cardiologist switch anoth beta blocker I tri sever one bisoprolol nadolol timolol pindolol acebutolol all fail control tachycardia In 2 year I start heart relat symptom chest pain jaw pain left arm pain exercis intoler dizzi vertigo intestin problem low energi physic mental I sever anxieti panic agoraphobia somatis gad social anxieti My anxieti well control Im med sensit cant take antidepress like paxil lexapro even older one like imipramin 1 mg paxil send ER lexapro didnt problem drug took anxieti year Im high dose clonazepam 7 mg day Im addict slow taper withdraw will take year get clonazepam I also deal mani panic attack everi day cant get th hous cant stay alon everyth trigger heart relat symptom like tachycardia chest pain loud sound music much peopl around My nervou system seem overact Im alway sick chronic headach heart pound chest time even heart rate normal droop blood pressur high blood pressur feel hot time cant sweat cant exercis walk caus low energi physic endur I saw cardiogist 2 week ago look last holter monitor result said anxieti said I may dysautonomia probabl caus anxieti I stabl 10 mg x 3 propranolol day last 7 month tachycardia control He suggest RX 25 mg x 2 day metoprolol I start take metoprolol 2 week ago I feel aw not help tachycardia make anxieti wors I migrain throb pain head sinc I start 2 week ago I chest pain left arm hand numb time My jaw hurt teeth also I insomnia vision chang energi level even lower propranolol I also feel depress the propranolol dont I feel aw I decreas dose 125 mg everi 12 hour insistead 25 mg everi 12 hour even lower dose I feel bad Im one problem metoprolol brand name lopressor it immedi releas one XL I call cardio doc ask put propranolol dont return phone call back the one beta blocker I never tri bystol new canada expens I also hear anxieti bad well share your experi metoprolol vs propranolol It cant head I mean side effect metoprolol horribl
1545,Nadolol+hypertension,I just saw a new Hepatologist who suggested that I am most likely already in Stage 4; based solely on my platelet count. My last biopsy in 2006 showed Grade 3; stage 3. He has scheduled other tests; but in the meantime; be prescribed Xifaxan to control ammonia levels. Has anyone taken this drug; and if so; for how long? I understand that the FDA has only recently approved it for this use. SInce it is classified as an antibiotic; I don't understand how it can be used long term without harmful side effects. I'm sacred and freaking out a little bit about the cirrhosis diagnosis; and wonder if there's anything I should be doing differently with diet and supplements.

1546,Nadolol+hypertension,My sister has hht and cirrosis. She had a foot and a half of her intestines removed in Oct. becasue of uncontrollable bleeding. She was doing well and then fell and broke her femur. She is in a rehab facility but is scheduled to be released this week. She has had her abdomen drained twice in the past month. She looks scary. She lives in Fl. and I live in Tx. She does not want to move in with us. She is very bright and bounces between hopeful and positive and depressed. She is on lactalose and lasiks. Does anyone have any idea as to the time she has left? The doctor has said between 6 months and 2 yrs. That's a pretty big ballpark. Much thanks and love to all of you. This is so difficult.

1547,Nadolol+hypertension,Hello; I was diagnosed with end stage cirrhosis back in March 2010. My last lab test revealed my platelet count is down to 60k. I have concerns since I read I could be heading for real trouble at around 20k. I have splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) which I think is directly responsible for the low platelet count. Any suggestions I would sure appreciate.

1549,Nadolol+hypertension,My hemoglobin is now down from 9.9 to 9.6; I was taken off the riba completely 10 days ago. My peg-interferon dose was reduced to the 1.35 line around the same time. I have advanced cirrhosis which has been pretty stable in recent years but now my old nemesis; ascites has returned and my legs and feet are swollen and belly quite distended. I've put on 12-14 lbs in the last 1.5 to 2 weeks; I'm certain it's all fluid retention. I am very concerned about this as I've had bleeding varices twice in the past and I was fortunate to survive. What has triggered the ascites? I haven't had that problem for a few years now. I know that anti-depressants can tweak the liver but I'm on a tiny; 5mg. dose of celexa. If the triple therapy is responsible; then at what cost am I eradicating the HCV; possible new and serious damage to my fibrous liver? In the past; I was told to double my dose of spironolactone; which worked but not quickly. I still remain undetected; but now I'm concerned with everything else. Trying to hang in there but ascites really scares me. I'm considering going to the ER today; as the gastro. clinic is closed on weekends; maybe I'm just having a panic attack.,2012,2012,,Male,,,My hemoglobin 99 96 I taken riba complet 10 day ago My peginterferon dose reduc 135 line around time I advanc cirrhosi pretti stabl recent year old nemesi ascit return leg feet swollen belli quit distend ive put 1214 lb last 15 2 week Im certain fluid retent I concern ive bleed varic twice past I fortun surviv what trigger ascit I havent problem year I know antidepress tweak liver Im tini 5mg dose celexa If tripl therapi respons cost I erad hcv possibl new seriou damag fibrou liver In past I told doubl dose spironolacton work quickli I still remain undetect Im concern everyth els tri hang ascit realli scare Im consid go ER today gastro clinic close weekend mayb Im panic attack
1550,Nadolol+hypertension,I have had PVC's for 15 years; last fall I started getting a block of PVC's maybe everyother beat for minutes. I have taken corgard or nadolol for years. This usually happens when I set down or lay down; and they leave with exercise. This seem to get progressavely worse with just this past month and even now I am wearing an event monitor the event monitor showed runs of PVC's and my Internal Med. Doctor put me on rythmol 225 extended release. I have looked at articles that it is best to live with PVC's than to take strong meds. was this a wise choice for me? I have been on rythmol for 7 days now and get a little dizzy when I first stand up and a little sluggish. I have had a stress test with pictures of my heart it was excellent; both the stress test and the pictures of my heart. When you look at form 1 to 20 PVC's pr minute that could be as high as 1200 PVC's each hour. Does rythmol seem the best direction now that my Dr. has rulled out other problems with tests; ekg; stress test with pictures; echo ekg or should I try to ignore the PVC's althoough I feel each one.

1552,Nadolol+hypertension,"My friends; I know I brought this up before; but I have a cautionary tale regarding what I'm going through and what you should be aware of. I had an examination for Esophageal Verices about a year and a half ago. The Gastro banded one. A year ago; he repeated the examination and found none. So on I went with my life as I felt normal. My last ultrasound had a conclusion of ""mildly Cirrhotic"". This morning; I had another examination for Verices and sure enough; the Gastro found and banded three. He gave me a photo of the stomach where the verices were growing. What I mean by growing is that the blood vessel will start to form a balloon like visual abnormality in a section of the vein. If this balloon were to burst; especially while sleeping; internal bleeding can occur without you knowing it. This is very scary and could cause death. So in essence; I questioned the doctor today and asked if one does not have Cirrhosis but has Hepatitis C; can one get Esophageal Verices. He said yes. So please be warned. I'm very fortunate that my Gastro who has been treating me for nine years is always on top of this. Is yours? I would strongly recommend asking him even if you do not have Cirrhosis. The banding is done in a 20-30 minute procedure. The anesthetic used is Propofol. This drug is what supposedly caused Michael Jackson's death because he was given it steadily and not in a normal dosage for his sleep disorder. I had the opportunity to discuss this anesthetic (which looks like milk) and its propensity to cause toxicity to the liver. He replied that even though it is metabolized in the liver; the amount is nothing to worry about. I watched the anesthesiologist inject me with two large syringes of Propofol. I saw the firs one go in intravenously; but was knocked out before the second one was administered. The next thing I saw was an RN leaning over me in recovery. There is pain to be sure. some from gas; the rest from the banding. You cannot eat meat or bread for three days. I took two Oxycodone 7.5mg pain pills about an hour ago. The pain has been reduced by 50% and is acceptable. In conclusion; please ask your Gastro regarding this very important examination; of which many Heppies never think about. My Gastro is very proficient and always on guard. He also mentioned that in the latest study he read; Telaprevir has a 50% chance of clearing non-responders like myself. This is a much better percentage than the current 15-20% with traditional drugs. At any rate; I thought I would pass this important information along because the Gastro mentioned EVERYONE who has Hepatitis C should be checked for Verices every 6 months...

1559,Nadolol+hypertension,My husband has Cirrhosis and Hepatitis C. I am very concerned for him. He sees a Gastroenterologist but we are thinking about changing doctors. The Dr. is very vague and will not just come out right and tell us how bad off my husband is. My husband has had to have esophageal varices banding done twice. The first time he was an Alcoholic and almost bled to death. He was immediately banded. This 2nd time was a couple months ago and they went in to check the bands and banded off some more varices. He has been cleaned of alcohol and drugs for 4 years now; Praise God! My question is; when it comes to the point of esophageal banding; is your liver very bad off? We had to go see a surgeon today because he has gallstones. The surgeon will not take his gallbladder out because he has too high of a risk of bleeding. The surgeon mentioned a liver transplant; which his gastroenterologist has never mentioned. I am just very confused!

I do not understand why they keep adding them if their obviously not working? I've read about shunts being put in if the banding does not work; is anyone familiar with this? Please help I feel so helpless. He has thrown up all day today (2 bands thrown up). Doctors say he is a stage 4 cirrhosis; they've never mentioned if he's decomp or comp liver. Our doctor says overall he looks great; no accidtes (spell check). He has enlarged varricies tho and of course an enlarged spleen. I see all these people saying their loved ones were diagnosed with stage 4 cirrhosis and that the doctor said that's it there's nothing they can do so my question is WHY have they not told me this yet???

1562,Nadolol+hypertension,"My wife has cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. She is no longer drinking and is getting better.

1563,Nadolol+hypertension,I am a casually athletic female; age 49; nonsmoker; bp averaging 130/80; total cholesterol 126. Diagnosed with mild MVP/minimal MR 1985 by 2-d echo; nadolol 40 mg qd; down to 10 last year. No change on yearly echoes; asymptomatic from '87 til this year. No family history of arrhythmia. Late February had mild afebrile illness; malaise without URI symptoms. Once sudden tachycardia on minimal exertion; then twice prolonged severe chest tightness (4+ hours) radiating into arms. All labs normal (incl ESR and C-RP; cardiac enzymes not checked); no ECG changes. Mild chest discomfort persisted for 3 weeks but returned to brisk walks 3-4 hrs/week. Echo in mid-March unchanged; LVEF 62%. Frequent pvcs started late March; referred to university cardio; 8445 pvcs/24 hours on Holter; no couplets or runs; echo mid April showed normal MV; mild MR; mild TR; mildly dilated left atrium; LVEF 60%. Referred to EP; diagnosed polymorphic pvcs of idiopathic RVOT origin; switched from nadolol to verapamil 80 mg tid; helps but getting some breakthrough. Last week mibi stress test normal at 98% maximal HR; MRI scheduled next week to rule out ARVD. 1. What would be the significance of latest echo findings; if any? EP is unconcerned; should I be? 2. Does this sound like it could be the aftermath of myocarditis? With my history how likely is ARVD? 3. EP has recommended ablation; how likely is this to be successful (assuming no ARVD).

1566,Nadolol+hypertension,about 3 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Hep C and stage 4 cirrhosis. I quickly started treatment. I was working at the time and had health coverage provided by my employer. Though I was so sick; I kept going until the lab called me on a Sunday and advised me to stop meds and call my Dr. That Wednesday I saw my Dr. who advised me to go home and rest the meds had completely wiped me out. I applied for SSD; but it took a long time and while waiting I used all my savings; sold a car; refinanced our house; and ran our credit cards up so high I don't know if they'll ever get paid. Now I have EGD's every six months; I've also had 5 veins banded. My Dr. has mentioned a liver transplant; and told me we would talk more about it in September. My concern is how will I pay for it? I now have Medicare & Medicare Part D. Also the lifetime of expense meds I've heard about. I've been using med marijuana and now have my wieght back; but I also heard that this would prevent me from qualifying for a transplant. I know the end is near; and if the only obstacle is smoking pot; I'll quit. Otherwise; I will continue with this as I feel so much better after.

Before starting treatment he wants to do a scope to see if I have veriance (?) you guys know what I mean. Because my wbc was low and platlets also low. If I do hopefully I do not he will band them. Nervious; happy; scared but looking to get this stuff out of my body! He also said that now its almost 90% for type 2. Seeing as I dont have any other choices I guess I'll do it. I am actually more nervious about the scope; band thing than the treatment. We also talked about the rh factor rhogram shots that I had in the late 70s and early 80s when I had my kids and seeing as I had none of the other exposure; drugs; surgery; bloodtrans. he was thinking that was a pretty good guess. :( wish me luck and here we go on a wild adventure.,2011,2011,58.0,Female,,,went see hepatologist today want treatment happi see I geno type 2 befor start treatment want scope see I verianc guy know I mean becaus wbc low platlet also low If I hope I band nerviou happi scare look get stuff bodi He also said almost 90 type 2 see I dont choic I guess ill I actual nerviou scope band thing treatment We also talk rh factor rhogram shot I late 70 earli 80 I kid see I none exposur drug surgeri bloodtran think pretti good guess wish luck go wild adventur

1572,Nadolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 29/M. In October I started having red/teary eye with sinus pain. PCP thought sinusitis. Later - tingling in left arm and leg; foggy state; headache on each side of head. After many CTs and MRIs and many other doctors - everything OK. Did B1; B6; B12; sinus CT; head CT; brain MRI in December; ENG in February - all negative. Finally did another MRI in March with some alarming news. Now I am freaking out because I've been referred to the MS center at UCSF. Here is the summary: Findings: The ventricals are normal in size and symmetric in the midline without evidence of mass effect or shift. Cortical sulci and subarachanoid spaces are symmtric and normal. There are two tiny white matter lesions adjacent to the trigone of the right lateral ventricle; seen only on the coronal FLAIR sequence. There is no contrast enhancement of these small lesions and no other contrast enhancing lesions are identified. No other abnormal foci of increased or decreased signal intensity are seen anywhere intracranially. Normal gray/white matter differentiation. Impression: 1. Two tiny white matter lesions adjacent to the trigone of the right lateral ventricle without evidence of surrounding edema or mass effect and not demonstrating contrast enhancement. The largest of these measures about 4 mm in size and the second measures 2 mm. These lesions are nonspecific and could represent some chronis gliosis or scarring. Early demyelinating disease cannot be entirely excluded. 2. Otherwise normal appearing magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. Any ideas?

1573,Nadolol+hypertension,I am the mother of a 15 year-old daughter that suffered cardiac arrest in October 2006 while playing volleyball. A defibrillator was used and she was brought back. Here is the history: * Surgery in November 2005 to correct a pectus excavatum. While in recovery she started throwing arrythmia's; lots of pvc; couplets etc. She had several EKGs and Echo's and there was no damage to the heart from the surgery. She had a metal bar implanted under her sternum known as the Nuss procedure. No incidence of PVCs before sugery; pre surg testing or any mention of of pvcs during her yearly physicals etc before her 2005 surgery. * Sudden cardiac arrest in October 2006 playing volleyball. She was cleared by her cardio to play sports upon entrance to high school. * The defib strip showed ventricular fibrillation. * Tox came back neg for any drugs etc. Potassium was a little low. * A week after her arrest she had a defib implanted. * She underwent genetic testing which came back negative for catecholamenergic ventricular tachy. * Family history of PVCs; mother (myself); nephew; brother and half sister. No incidence of any sudden cardiac death for any immediate or removed family member. * Newest holter reading shows an increase of over 30% of all heartbeats are pvc's. EP said a year ago she was 15%. * She takes 40 mg of Nadolol 2x day and 150 mg 2x a day of Mexiletine. * She has suffered from depression and eating disorder but no pvc diagnosis during either evaluations (before 2005 surgery). Her EP wants to do another echo to look at possible ARVD. She can no longer play sports and her quality of life is for the most part is not okay. She's always tired and can't do things that her friends can etc. etc. This in turn aggravates my PVCs and the vicious cycle begins. I guess my questions are: 1.

1574,Nadolol+hypertension,Hi; I have had hep. c genotype 2 for decades and in the past year have had symptoms of cirrhosis. Extreme itching; fatigue; ascites; edema; nosebleeds etc. I don't have hx insurance but I went to a clinic that does trial studies for interferon and 2 new drugs shown to be very effective for tx hep. c. The Dr. will do a biopsy but feels that I probably have cirrhosis which will preclude me from the studies at their clinic. My question is; if I have cirrhosis can I get tx (elsewhere) for hep. c or is it considered too dangerous to subject a cirrhotic liver to?

1576,Nadolol+hypertension,I have had 2 neck surgerys & I am still in pain. I have had C5-6 fused 8yrs ago & last yr I had C6-7 & I am still in a great deal of pain in my shoulders & down both arms & in my neck. I am still under doctors care but he is telling me there is nothing more he can do for me that I have to live with this pain. I have no life because after I get off work the only thing I want to do is use the heating pad & lye down to rest my neck. I do data entry 40hr a week & it is killing me to do that; I am not sure if I am going to be able to continue. My doctor is telling me that the data entry will not make me any worse than I am & I am finding that hard to believe since my job is hurting me so bad so I would like to know your opinion on that; Please. I have a copy of my last MRI it says there is mild facet hypertrophy in C2-3 with no signifcant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing. Then C3-4 There is very small left paracentral posterior disc osteophyte complex; unchanged. Associated mild facet hypertrophy results in mild left neural foraminal narrowing. No signifcant central canal or right neural foraminal narrowing. In C4-5 a very small broad based disc bulge minimally flattens the anterior thecal sac without signifcant central canal narrowing. Mild facet hypertrophy contributes to mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. C5-6 There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing. No signifcant central canal or right neural foraminal narrowng.

1577,Nadolol+hypertension,Just got my latest biopsy result and to be honest I'm kind of freaking out a little. Just taking the time to read through how much encouragement people give to others on this forum is very helpful. My last biospy in 2005 was stage 1 grade 1. I did 14wks of Pegasys then but was non-responder. I'm 48 y.o. male; also HIV+ (stable and undetectable) and otherwise very healthy; eat well and exercise regularly. I've been feeling perfectly fine...at least I was until now :( Now it looks like possible cirrhosis. I'm really stunned that it has progressed so fast: SUMMARY -Fragmented and nodular liver biopsy with at least focal bridging fibrosis -Chronic hepatitis C with minimal activity (grade 1 of 4) Comment: Although the degree of fragmentation here precludes accurate staging; the presence of nodular regeneration; focal bridging fibrosis and fragmentation raises concern for underlying cirrhosis. I'll be starting Infergen+RIbaviran as soon as dr gets insurance approval. How reversible is this likely to be - if I respond? And what else can I do to take care of myself?

1578,Nadolol+hypertension,After a long waiting for close to 4 months; the docs at government hospital have rated my mum as having Cirrhosis based Child-Pugh score with Grade B They did endoscopy-OGDS Oesphageal varices HCV and found the followings: 1. Small submucosal dilated veins at distal oesophagus. No ulcer/bleeding. 2. Extensive erythema at antrum with modular erosions at the body. 3. Portal gastropathy. No fundal varix seen. 4. D1 duodenitis. 5. D2 normal. Mum's blood platelets count is 86 and they refused to consider her the therapy. Also they indicated her chance of living for another 5 years is 50%-50%. They never mentioned anything on liver transplant options. Question for experts on this forum: 1. Is my mum really having less than 5 years to live or it can be more? 2. Does she has any other option like liver transplant for her age(60)? 3. Any latest medication for Cirrhosis? Hope to get some answers. Thanks All!

1582,Nadolol+hypertension,"Can anyone figure out what is going on with me? I do not have; nor can I afford; health insurance right now. Here's my story: I am a 28 y/o male who has been experiencing a heart flutter/vibration/palpitation while sleeping since May 09 (that I know of). Pretty much every night; within a minute of falling asleep; I am re-awoken by my heart vibrating. You can still feel the ventricle contractions at normal pace; but there is also another beat (atrial I'm assuming); which is normally 200-300 bpm; and feels like a vibration. Once I wake up it starts to go away. It is normally 3-4 times faster than my resting HR; and will shift down to about twice as fast; then shift again to normal rhythm - each of these shifts is very quick (ie it will be 300bpm then 150bpm two beats later); and normally takes about 1-2 minutes to return to normal. Once it finally shifts down to normal rhythm; my heart will usually then beat very hard a few dozen times; or more; before returning to relatively normal. This happens nearly every night; but varies in intensity depending on my stress levels. It also seems to occur only at certain times of the night - right when I fall asleep; about 3-4 hrs into my sleep; and then about 7-8 hrs into my sleep. My wife periodically feels my chest when I'm asleep and she generally reports it feels normal; but I am not sure if she can always feel it; but I have made her feel it before; so I would think most of the time her observation is correct. When it first happened last May I awoke at 4am and I though to myself; ""Must be a small earthquake""; which would not be out of the ordinary where I live. But then I realized it was my heart and became very worried and went to the ER. They did an echo and everything was fine (I was awake; so of course). The doc did notice I had an ectopic beat though; which I didn't have before (I don't think); but now get daily and they fluctuate in frequency with my stress levels - some days my heart will skip every 3-4 beats all day long. I later went to the county clinic (as I cannot afford health insurance); and the doc there put me on propranalol; but dismissed the vibrations - claiming that it is not my heart; and if it were; I would not be able to feel it. He did recommend pressing on my jugular to relieve it; which worked; so he said then it had to be PAC or PSVT. But I am 1000% certain the vibration is my heart - I am not the only one who can feel it. I took the propranalol for about 6 months; then decided to step off it to see what happens and it has gotten better since coming off the meds; but has not gone away. That's the gist of what's bothering me right now; but there's more to this story that may give a clue as to what's going on; I don't know. A little background on me: I am 28; very fit; exercise regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke; don't do drugs or any other medications; drink moderately; only 1 cup of coffee a day; don't have any allergies; no other medical problems - I was the epitome of health and fitness before this started happening. However; last year when this all started happening was one of the most stressful times in my life. I am normally a ""Type A""; higher stress individual; but not to any sort of extreme (I'm not really even much of a worrier). I was nearing the end of college (read: finals); newly married; working 3 jobs; getting very little and irregular sleep; and was very strained financially. In January 09 I experienced a sudden chest pain while bagging up some groceries at the store. It was very sudden; sharp; and intense; deep in the center of my chest. It was so intense in fact that it nearly knocked me over - I had to grab onto the counter to stay standing. It really freaked me out; but I am so healthy that I figured it probably wasn't anything serious and I would just monitor any changes. Then it happened about 2 weeks later while sitting in class; but less intense this time. It kept happening every few weeks; for several months; but every time it happened it was less intense and not as painful; until it was just a slight uncomfortable twinge. In the last 6 months or so it’s only happened once or twice; and only very slightly. Then the sleep event happened in May; where I went to the ER and eventually got on the propranalol. For about the first 3 weeks after the trip to the ER I was extremely stressed; worried; and scared about my heart issue; on top of being right in the middle of finals. For those few weeks my heart constantly beat very hard in my chest; not fast; but like it was trying to leap out of my chest. I had a lot of skipped beats; felt light-headed on the worse days; and generally felt like I could drop dead any minute. I abstained from anything that could aggravate my condition - caffeine; alcohol; exercise; etc. Eventually I calmed down and the symptoms improved. This convinced me that it was likely being exacerbated by my anxiety and stress. Over time I reincorporated things back into my normal life - exercise first; as I am a field scientist. Then caffeine and alcohol each and they didn't seem to bother my heart much (alcohol moreso; but nothing much to worry about). But my sleep issue remained and only fluctuated with stress levels. So I tried eliminating the pills; which did help as I mentioned; but my problem persists. And some nights it seems as though it is inordinately intense considering relatively low levels of anxiety/stress. So I'm still confused about it.

1583,Nadolol+hypertension,"Hello Doctor; I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hosting this forum; I've posted once before and have found it very informative and helpful; thank you! I have a few questions concerning PVC's & PAC's. I have been evaluted by two different cardiologists with a battery of tests and everthing is normal; noted 1/2 apical ejection (flow) murmur only (28 year old male; 5' 11""; 190LBS; athletic). 1. From what I understand now; PVC's & PAC's are not harmful; is either worse than the other? ie. more PVC's 2. Is the sensation of a skipped beat the result of an extra beat or is the sensation from the extra flow of blood resulting from a longer pause in the heart rythm? 3. If an individual is experiencing for example 1;000 PAC's/PVC's on a daily basis; does that signify an extra 1;000 beats? Wouldn't these extra beats over a span of an average life ""tire"" the heart muscle? 4. I notice in my resting pulse only (around 48-52BPM) that sometimes after relaxing from either a work-out or just normal activity that a few beats are longer apart then others; however this is pattern is repeatitive; meaning the longer pause are not totally random but will repeat after the same number of beats per minute. My question is what's considered and irregular to regular pulse? 5. From your experience with past and present patients; have you seen any individuals experiencing PVC's/PAC's every go away entirely? 6. Are they the cause of some part of SA/NA node's deteriating? 7.

It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times.

1587,Nadolol+hypertension,I am a 38 yr old female. About a year ago I started to experience a very strange feeling that occurs periodically when I move from a sitting to a standing position and start to walk. The sensation is as if my head and neck are throbbing with pressure and I have to stop walking or slow down and stop and stand still for a minute or so to make the sensation stop. Sounds are muffled in rhythm with the pulsations and I sometimes feel as if I will pass out; but never have. There is no pain. I have been checked throughly by my GP; a cardiologist; and an electrophysiologist and none of them could find a cause. It does seem to happen sometimes when I am hungry and have missed a meal or eaten later than usual. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

1588,Nadolol+hypertension,Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this post. 10 days ago; my brother; who is 50; was diagnosed with chirrosis of the liver; Hep B and C. He was told his White blood platlets were 40 and was suppose to be 100. I don't know what that means really? Also; The trunk of his body is yellowish; the whites of his eyes are yellowing as well. We are not 10 days past the diagnosis and I am still trying to get him seen by a GI Dr. Everyone seems to be dragging their feet. I notice he is often tired; he is itchy at night; eating exsessivley but he is not at all overweight. His stomach was swollen; which is what first lead him to going to the hospital. He complains of his right side hurting him a lot. He is taking vitamins; some milk something or other that is suppose to help the liver. I just would like for someone to help me understand all of this; his general practice doctor told him she would suspect he had 6 to 9 mos. to live. How could she possibly know this? She is no expert; and certainly not God. Can someone please lead to to things he could do to boost the white blood platlets while I wait to get him in to a GI; can someone offer some suggestions about their experience or what I need to know; do; or expect. I am truly at a loss and I feel as though my hands are tied. Again; Thank you for your time.

1589,Nadolol+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

1590,Nadolol+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement. Anyone with any help or suggestions I would REALLY appreciate it.,2008,2008,,,,,
