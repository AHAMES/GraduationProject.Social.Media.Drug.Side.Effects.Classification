1,Amlodipine+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40.0,Female,40yearold ladi i diagnos hypertens 200100 sinc 2005 i take atenolol 25 mg night 2 year in 2007 i deliv babi boy age 37 sinc i rapid weight gain short breath i walk step climb stair i feel uneasi breath i exert after rest goe i continu atenolol 25 mg i underw echo 2008 normal i also underw lipid profil ldl triglycerid high sinc bp control atenolol cardiologist suggest take carvedilol 625 mg after 2 year i underw master health checkup i underw echo treadmil test chest xray blood urin test again reveal bp high ldl triglycerid high cardiologist precrib month carvedilol anticholesterol medic even take drug i uneasi chest i exert he suggest undergo angiogram then i check anoth cardiologist chang carvedilol amlodipin bp then chang combin atenolol amlodipin bp fine but i still uneasi chest i exert bp control sometim goe 150100 my thyroid function normal my diabet test normal my triglycerid ldl still reduc i take atorvastatin lipid last 6 month i sever daytim somnol i work medic transcriptionist my job stress job i depress took antidepress 3 month last year after take i irregular cycl weight gain i stop my daytim sleepi sever i abl concentr work i abl peac sleep when i sleep night i feel awak whole night race thought i feel rest i get i heavi snore i underw pulmonari function test normal i took chest xray doctor felt i might cardiomegali i underw eye exam vision perfect normal except dri eye i use artifici tear i extern hemorrhoid kind suggest test done daytim somnol rapid weight gain i check almost specialti i confus reason would

However; my resting pulse rate has consistently been in the 90's and increasing into the 100's at time; so I have been prescribed Carvedilol to help control the heart rate.

5,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male,i male 70 year age i 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 this control bp within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 my doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 my concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead i tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret
6,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 64 yrs. old woman who used to take Diovan 320 mg. & Toprol 50 mg. for my B.P.

So far; my B.P. readings is very good; 110/70. But eversince I started the Norvasc; my left leg is swelling and it is becoming worst. I'd like to ask my Doctor to discontinue the Norvasc. Is there any other calcium blocker that doesn't cause swelling? I've already taken Zestril (ace inhibitor) with the Diovan before.

7,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hello; I'm 45yo.caucasian male.Height 173 cm; Weight 68 kg.2;5 months ago I started taking Lodoz 2;5 mg (bisoprolol with diuretic); blood persure before taking medicine was approximately 160/100. The medicine was prescribed in the same dose by general practice doctor 2;5 months ago . In the meantime I did ultrasound of the heart and the result seems to be OK. as wel as EKG. In addition to hypertension I have high cholesterol values(Tested on 20/03/2009: Choletsrol was 5;6; LDL= 3;5 ; HDL =1;42; b on 05/05/2009 i did another test in different lab; results were Cholesterol= 6.9; LDL=4;90; HDL=1;20. I do not take any drug for cholesterol;have started using fermented red rice. I am still smoking. "" Lodoz""2;5 mg seems to control my blood preasure fine. I don't have problems with heart rate (usually between 70 and 80 during the day and around 60 in the morning) before taking beta blocker I usually had quite high HR (approximately 90) I'm writing all this because it seems that I started to suffer from ""Erectile Dysfunction""or at least everything seems to be pretty much different than before. Behavior has been changing during period of taking drug. In the meantime I was reading a lot and would appreciate professional help;advice; suggestions and comments. I have found out that there is not easy to stop taking ""BETA BLOCKERS"" if needed it has to be gradually. I wonder would it be worth of trying switching to other BETA BLOCKER that is more selective such as ""NEBIVOLOL"". ; could I switch to ACE inhibitor (was taking one 5 years ago; they were working for me at that time as well.My blood pressure was then marginal and quit after about month and a half) or maybe should I switch to something like ""LOSARTAN"" Thank You very much for help in advance Kind regards; Bruno",2009,2009,,Male,hello im 45yocaucasian maleheight 173 cm weight 68 kg25 month ago i start take lodoz 25 mg bisoprolol diuret blood persur take medicin approxim 160100 the medicin prescrib dose general practic doctor 25 month ago in meantim i ultrasound heart result seem ok wel ekg in addit hypertens i high cholesterol valuestest 20032009 choletsrol 56 ldl 35 hdl 142 b 05052009 anoth test differ lab result cholesterol 69 ldl490 hdl120 i take drug cholesterolhav start use ferment red rice i still smoke lodoz25 mg seem control blood preasur fine i dont problem heart rate usual 70 80 day around 60 morn take beta blocker i usual quit high hr approxim 90 im write seem i start suffer erectil dysfunctionor least everyth seem pretti much differ behavior chang period take drug in meantim i read lot would appreci profession helpadvic suggest comment i found easi stop take beta blocker need gradual i wonder would worth tri switch beta blocker select nebivolol could i switch ace inhibitor take one 5 year ago work time wellmi blood pressur margin quit month half mayb i switch someth like losartan thank you much help advanc kind regard bruno

9,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear. But im wondering now if it was from this pulmonary hypertention...???? All the articles im finding on PH says it is fatal and always progresses!!!,2015,2015,32.0,Male,i 33 year old femal mother 3 year old twin worri recent echo result i start palpit year ago random chest pain everi whileenough worri so start see cardiologist coupl yrs ago everi sinc begin seem minim symptom test result ive wore holter monitor twice state tachycardia otherwis seem normal my echo one year ago show mild mitral valv prolaps borlerlin leaki valvebut otherwis state echo look normal strong well went anoth echo month ago show mild mitral valv prolaps expect also said surpris find mild pulmonari hypertens he total blew said noth worri sinc wasnt symptom said schedul 6 month he state sometim thesenfind echo wrong felt noth concern feel uneasi find request 2 echo report compar year old echo show 35 pressur one yr later show 40 whi isnt concern i schedul appt pulmonari doctor next wk worri sick i 57 weigh 120lbshave regular lower bp otherwis healthi otherwis a coupl month ago wss short breath felt like congest chest even went famili doctor said lung sound clear but im wonder pulmonari hypertent all articl im find ph say fatal alway progress

16,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 40 year-old wife in recent months has undergone a number of tests following some weight loss. It transpires that she is suffering from hypertension with her 24hr ambulatory readings averaging at 170/110. Further diagnostic tests (ECG; echo and cardiac MRI) were undertaken and her cardiologist told her that her heart is enlarged (moderate) with impaired function (I believe ejection fraction in the region of 45%) but has not been able to identify the root cause of the hypertension. She is asymptomatic and does not have any issues in terms of fatigue; breathlessness; swelling; etc. She has been prescribed 5mg Amlodipine; 5mg Ramipril and 2.5mg Bisprolol. The Cardiologist has told her she will be on medication for longevity and that improving the condition will take a long time. Her blood pressure has already come down to 132/84 which the cardiologist was very pleased with. She will be seeing him again in 8/9 weeks with a follow up echo in 4/5 months. In terms of the diagnosis; the cardiologist has referred only to hypertension but having read and aligned the symptoms of the enlarged heart and impaired function; is it not heart failure.....? Also; what is the prognosis for an enlarged heart caused by hypertension; especially in someone of 40 years of age.....can the enlarged heart and function return to normal over time with the medication?

17,Amlodipine+hypertension,Thank you all that have shared your stories and journey with this disease. I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with hypertension with kidney failure? Harley's bp are high and he's on the highest doses of medication they can give him. Because of the hypertension and now a heart murmurs the vet feels that giving him subq fluids will do more harm than good. Has anyone else found a way to balance fluids with hypertension? His creatinine level is 3.8; BUN is 96 and phosphorous is 9 all which have doubled in the past week and with BP's around 160/100. He's on encard; enalapril; Amlodipine; Epakatin and Pepcid. My little guy Harley was first diagnosed with kidney disease when he was 5; he is now 13 wow! He was asymptomatic for 8 years; our only intervention was diet. Harley is now getting to end stage; even though I know this would happen it's still so hard. Who knew that a 20lb beagle would be the love of my life.

19,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi doctor; Firstly thankyou in advance for your service. I am a 26 year old female; 125lbs 5'5''; non-smoker. I was diagnosed as having Hypertension when I was 23; no family history of any cardiac problems. I had all the routine tests to rule out secondary causes and was therefore diagnosed as having essential/primary hypertension and commenced on Losartan; my BP remained uncontrolled running about 150/100 and throughout numerous months my medication was changed; finally settling at 100mg Losartan and 10mg Amlodipine which kept my BP controlled at around 120/70. I have recently had a baby and my BP again became very uncontrolled at the end of pregnancy and I was induced; my BP remained high after the birth between 140-160/100-110 and 4 weeks later I had a suspected TIA were I lost feeling down my left side and had diffilculty speaking; this episode lasted around 2minutes in total. I have since been under going routine tests to confirm or rule out a TIA and was commenced on aspirin. The MRI and Carotid artery ultrasound were negative and the Echo/TOE (TEE) showed my heart was fine except the presense of a 'small hole' my doctor said the hole is very common and that they do not think there is any need to close it. My questions to you are: Is it likely the small hole is a PFO? Could there be any relation between the PFO and my unexplained hypertension in someone my age? Is the presense of a PFO enough evidence to confirm a TIA? Would Hypertension and a PFO increase the risk of stroke/TIA in the future? What would be your advice?

I have been an extremely strong athlete to the point of climbing very briskly up to Base Camp on Mt. Everest in 2003. Over the past couple of years; I have become increasingly out of breath with exercise at high elevations. I have had several ECGs done and they look excellent although borderline Pulmonary Hypertension is being considered and I'm going to have an exercise catherization done. I've spent the last 3 months on oxygen but do not need it at sea level. My internist in Chicago believes I'm having an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise and hi altitude (my bp is much higher up there) and recently told me that he has a patient who lives both in Chicago and in Aspen and has a similar issue. His cardiologist in Aspen put him on Norvasc; saying that it is specific for altitude induced hypertension. A cardiologist that I saw on Friday at the Cleveland Clinic could not confirm this. Any feedback to this question? I'm pretty desperate to get back to life as I once knew it!,2012,2012,,Male,hi i 53yrold femal live mountain colorado least half year last 13 year 10000 i extrem strong athlet point climb brisk base camp mt everest 2003 over past coupl year i becom increas breath exercis high elev i sever ecg done look excel although borderlin pulmonari hypertens consid im go exercis cather done ive spent last 3 month oxygen need sea level my internist chicago believ im exagger blood pressur respons exercis hi altitud bp much higher recent told patient live chicago aspen similar issu his cardiologist aspen put norvasc say specif altitud induc hypertens a cardiologist i saw friday cleveland clinic could confirm ani feedback question im pretti desper get back life i knew

22,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I'm a 63 yr old female who has recently been diagnosed with both hypothyroidism and hypertension. I haven't really experienced any overt symptoms of hypothyroidism beyond dry skin and possibly ""brain fog"" (after reading some of the comments of other posts - I think I can identify with that!). My TSH was extremely high (52 -- normal lab values to 2.5) and can't figure out why I didn't have more symptoms. My BP in Dr's office was very high - 177/90. Since then I have followed it at home for a week and have found only about 1 high reading a day of about 136/79 with 4 or 5 readings of about 117/74 with occasionally much lower readings. I've been on Lisinopril 20mg for 7 days and Levothyroxin 50 mcg for 4 days and feel ""strange""-- sometimes light-headed and weak. Is it possible to connect the elevated BP and hypothyroidism and is it possible to have a TSH value that high and not experience more hypothyroid symptoms?

26,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter.

35,Amlodipine+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate.

36,Amlodipine+hypertension,My BP was well-controlled on 100 mg Losartin and 7.5 mg Amlodipine; averaging around 125/68. At peak exertion; during a treadmill stress test recently; my systolic BP reached 215. My cardiologist subbed 5 mg Nebivolol for the Amlodipine due to what he described as exercise-related hypertension. I took this medication for a week and experienced a range of unpleasant side effects; including exhaustion; significant depression and reduced heart rate (mid-60s; compared with my normal mid-80s). I've been off the Nebivolol for five days; but I'm still experiencing these side effects. My heart rate has only come back to about 67-68. Given the half-life of this drug and the fact that I only took it for a week; these side effects seem excessive. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I see my cardiologist again on Tuesday; but in the meantime; I'm having a tough time concentrating at work and I'm very concerned.

Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96).

So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS? Could AS be the ""Pain"" that my son is having that we can't see?",2013,2013,29.0,Female,my son start spell jan 2012 would start throw pale blotchi dark circl eye we would take doctor would tell us take home full day would get better he would month later would happen would liter look like die final hospit vanderbilt children hospit caus bp extrem high18196 he final diagnos hypertens without reasonhi doctor told reason high blood pressur could pain someth couldnt see they ever test everyth came back normal current take amlodipin twice day bp run around 12075 everyday so got thinkingi gene hlab27 sign ankylos spondyl told like son would suffer well so question is link ankylos spondyl high blood pressur should i son test as could as pain son cant see
46,Amlodipine+hypertension,As from 22 Dec 2011; I had some discomforts consistent with high BP. Checked BP personally on an OMRON digital equipment which showed 98 /176. Doctor check and read 95 / 170. Had been taking Losar 25 (Losartan Potassium IP). Doctor increased the dosage to Losar 25x2 +Amlodipine Basilate 5mg. Still not much relief in the discomfort level. At random I have a kind of heaviness on my head; a feeling consistent with a person taking strong wine giving a post-feeling muscle pull on the face.(I do not drink or smoke). Also a kind of numbness is also felt at times. Discomfort or pain in the back and left side of head is felt (infrequent). Did an MRI Scan on 20 Jan 2012. 'Findings': T2 & FLAIR hyperintensities noted in bilateral fronto-parietal periventricular white-matter. (S/o Microvascular ischemic changes) Prominent Vircho Robin spaces noted in both basal ganglia and centrum semi-ovale regions. Ventricles appear mildly prominent.

47,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; First of all i would like to thank you or anyone for answering my question. I guess i have always had high blood pressure; recently at the doctors my blood pressure was 170/101 ; high? Yes; very high. I was given a medication; Amlodipine Besyl 2.5 mg tab. I was wondering if there are any great adverse side effects to this medicine? I know its good to take a healthy lifestyle to get my blood pressure down and it would just be good overall for everything. Would hypertension be one of the reasons to cause a sort of chronic fatigue? Also; if you know this; but does hypertension play a big role on your immune system or bodies ability to make antibodies? Thank you in advance for your replies; any suggestions or comments would be appreciated.,2011,2011,,Male,hi first would like thank anyon answer question i guess alway high blood pressur recent doctor blood pressur 170101 high yes high i given medic amlodipin besyl 25 mg tab i wonder great advers side effect medicin i know good take healthi lifestyl get blood pressur would good overal everyth would hypertens one reason caus sort chronic fatigu also know hypertens play big role immun system bodi abil make antibodi thank advanc repli suggest comment would appreci

54,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 3 1/2 yr old grandson has high blood pressure (180/120 when not on amlodipine); abdominal pain usually radiating from the umbilicus; extremity (usually leg) numbness to the point of occasional collapse; loss of appetite; weight loss; sometimes naussea and/or diarrhea. He has also had episodes of temporary blindness. This all began to manifest this summer (1 month after he turned 3 yrs. old). Prior to that he seemed to be a bright healthy happy child. In retrospect he may have been having intermittant spells of abdominal pain associated with this for several months before his first hospitalization in August 2007 as well as rapid onset (2 weeks) of a lazy eye in the spring of 2007 which may or may not be associated. He has now been hospitalized 4 times at Texas Children's Hospital. He has 5 doctors: pediatrician; renal; g.i.; neuro; and an opthamalogist. He is on Amlodipine daily; Zofran as needed; and most recently Periactin daily. He has had numerous head and abdominal CT scans with and without contrast; MRI's; Ultrasound; DMSA(?); 24 hrs. urinalysis; blood work. They can't find the cause of any of the symptoms. We've been through many diagnoses including acid reflux; psychosomatic pain for attention; Mesenteric Lymphadenitis; possible pheochromocytoma; inflammation of the brain and the latest is possibly abdominal migraines. Recently a friend's daughter was diagnosed with Addison's Syndrome and they have many of the same symptoms. Do you have any suggestions and in your opinion should we ask about seeing an Endocrinologist. One of the problems with so many doctors and Texas Children's Hospital is that each doctor seems to be just looking at their piece of the pie and have not yet all gotten together to compare notes.

55,Amlodipine+hypertension,"2009: episodes of chest pain; leading to cardiac cath with diagnosis of Prinzmetal's . Was started on amlodipine 5mg daily; continuation of Benicar 40mg daily (for chronic hypertension) and aspirin 325mg daily. This was effective. April 2013: intermittent bilateral arm pain; starting near elbows and within 5 seconds or so; involves total arms; hands and fingers and fine motor movements totally impaired. This intense pain lasts about 3-5 minutes; episodes 2-4 times a week. Interventional Cardiologist ordered thallium treadmill test; and stated that no cardiac damage seen. Amlodipine changed to 5mg twice daily; nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg prn; L-Arginine 4000mg twice daily and red yeast rice 2 capsules daily. I do not eat red meat or fried foods. No relief of symptoms. Isosorbide dinitrate 30mg started; no relief. Changed to Isosorbide mononitrate 30mg; No relief. Developed hacking cough lasting 2 months after isosorbide mononitrate discontinued. From April 2013 to January 2014 the episodes occurred 2-4 times a week. Then I did not have any more spasms until March 17; 2014. Since then I have had at least five a week; three days ago; I had three episodes. I understand that there is provocative testing during cardiac cath that involves inducing coronary artery spasm to ID the offending artery; and then that artery can be stented. The spasm can be rescued by intravenous nitroglycerin. My Interventional Cardiologist will not do this. I have not had any CHEST PAIN since 2009. I am 72 years old; 5'5""; 145 pounds; and walk 3 miles a day; up and down hills. B/P controlled; triglycerides and cholesterol within normal limits.

56,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I went to the doctors today and my blood pressure was 179/108. I do not really know much about the complications of hypertension or what can be done besides daily exercise. I have a prescription of AMLODIPINE BESYL 2.5 MG tablets. Are there any complications taking this medication for hypertension? I hear that it is bad to take medication because your body gets used to it. I am a 24 year old male; 6 foot tall weighing at 333 lbs. So im assuming it is my weight that is causing my blood pressure to be so high. Are there any tips besides daily exercise for reduction in blood pressure? Do i have to take medication forever or stop as soon as i get to a normal BP with a change in my dietary habits and weight issue? Any help would be appreciated; Thank you in advance.,2011,2011,,Male,hello i went doctor today blood pressur 179108 i realli know much complic hypertens done besid daili exercis i prescript amlodipin besyl 25 mg tablet are complic take medic hypertens i hear bad take medic bodi get use i 24 year old male 6 foot tall weigh 333 lbs so im assum weight caus blood pressur high are tip besid daili exercis reduct blood pressur do take medic forev stop soon get normal bp chang dietari habit weight issu ani help would appreci thank advanc

We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well.

59,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 ; ie High normal .. I didn't panic and I started to work on my lifestyle but nothing improved . After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings was always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist because I was obsessed with the idea of being hypertensive at this age ; 24 . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal (ranging bet . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and live my life normally and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were always ideal most of the time until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! The chest pain and palpitations frustrated me and I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Heart Ultrasound ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) The doctor ended up diagnosing essential hypertension after excluding a 2ry one especially after I made a kidney Ultrasound which was normal also . He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!!! I went to many doctors as you can see but no one could tell me what I am suffering from !!! I have been living in a misery for the past year and a half and don't really know what to do ??!! The doctors kept telling me that I am Ok and there is nothing to worry about ; but I am not Ok . I can feel myself more than anyone . Now ; I have those symptoms of the headaches ; stress and load around my head PLUS the palpitaions and right side chest pain despite taking the Amlodipine daily . What should I do ?!!! Pls. help me through this . Waiting your important response . Ahmed NB. Sex : Male . Age : 25 .

60,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi All - new on here. I have had three episodes of AF (July 06; Jan 08 and Feb 08); first treated with IV Flecanaide but the doctors are unwilling to use that again; so have put me on Amiodarone; Bisoprolol and Warfarin; on top of the meds I was already taking (Amlodipine; Losartan; Simvastatin); which seem to make me very tired and lethargic all of the time; and also very 'constricted' - even gentle excercise makes my chest tight and breathing difficult; and when I stand from sitting or crouching I nearly pass out. The consultant has discussed the topic of Ablation very briefly; but I think there are other tests they could do first? (treadmill; 48/72 hour heart trace) I should mention that I also have thickening of the heart wall muscle; which they are not sure about (could have been caused by hypertension or could be HCM) - I have had a cardiac MRI last month so that might help when I see the results. Can anyone shed any light or offer any suggestions about this? I was led to understand that the Ablation; if successful; could enable me to come off some of the medication I am on; which might let me get back to excercising normally again. I am only 50 years old and up to these latest episodes fit and active (golf; squash; cycling etc; none of which I can do atm); so all this is a bit of a pain as you can imagine.

63,Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past six months I have been waking up with a pounding heart and numb hands along with a pain under both sides of my ribcage and a slight headache. I have taken my bloodpressure and it is 120/79. I went to see my doctor and he said; I had a slightly high blood pressure 135/85. He put me on Amlodipine Besylate 5mg. My pressure has been 120/ 80 since. I told him about the pounding heartbeat and he sent me for a stress test; which he said was normal. What could be causing the pounding heartbeat ? I also wakeup feeling weak and tired; but it seems to go away once I get out of bed. I am 54 and also suffer with anxiety disorder and agoraphobia; but I never had THESE feelings before.

65,Amlodipine+hypertension,I have recently been prescribed Verapamil for migraine prevention but I'm also taking Norvasc. Should these medications be taken together? The Norvasc was prescribed a number of years ago by a different doctor for Migraine prevention. It hasn't helped my migraines but I've continued to take it.

68,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My son started having ""spells"" Jan. 2012 where he would start throwing up; very pale and blotchy; dark circle under his eyes. We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS?

74,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Doc; I am 20; and was found to have hypertension (140~160/90~110); and my diastolic was known to go up to 128...I was a regular blood donor for 3 years; so my hypertension was a sudden one... My doctor initially thought I had Thyrotoxicosis/Hyperthyroidism; because in addition to the sudden pressure; I had sweaty palms; tremors; eye-nipping and a systolic murmur... My TSH; T4 and T3 levels were normal... I also tested negative for Pheochromocytoma; Renal Artery Stenosis and Conn's...MRI/Ultrasound showed nothing significant; although my doctor thinks my adrenal glands look bulky... My tremors have since become quite bad...They tremble so badly I am actually aware of it. Sometimes my whole limb is trembling so badly; I feel my whole body tremble as well...And when Im nervous (Im taking a public speaking class; and I have to give weekly speeches); it becomes very bad; and I can't even hold anything; and my legs tremble too...And I get numbness in my fingers; and sudden pain in my legs for no reason... Last night when I went to sleep; I saw flashes of lights in fornt of my eyes for a few minutes; and I seem to occasionally drool when I lie down... I am now on Norvasc (Amlodipine) 5mg OD; and Diovan (Valsartan) 160mg OD...Pressure pretty well controlled... Could my initial TSH; T4 and T3 levels be wrong ie a false negative? Or could my symptoms be because of something else or due to my medication? By the way; the doctor wants me to get tested for Porphyria... Please advise.

76,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

77,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 .. After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings were always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were Ok until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Echocardiogram ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY ) 5) Kidney Ultrasound ( No stenosis or Kidney issue ; so the Dr. excluded a 2ry hypertension ) He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!

80,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female,i put bp medic januari 2012 i start amlodipin lisinopril lisinopril darn near kill the prescrib doctor would not take i stop take made appoint anoth doctor i take 125 mg metoprolol 10 mg amlodipin 3 month i copd someth aggrav breath problem i went doctor yesterday took metoprolol put 100 mg losartan he told stop take metoprolol i question start high dose losartan i seem sensit medic felt start right 100 mg bit high everyth ive read onlin suggest peopl usual start 50 mg i question stop metoprolol sudden both question fob i took first dose losartan 630 morn i alway take amlodipin 8 pm due hour a short time ago i sudden terribl spell i felt like i wasnt go abl get breath go even nebul i felt like bp went ear felt like burn this spell last 15 minut fast heart rate should losartan step metoprolol left kept rebound effect can anyon comment offer advic if i i would take chanc control high blood pressur natur would put toxic stuff bodi ive done lot research read past six month i read scare i get junk ive feed

82,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Dear All; I just stumbled on this website and I hope someone can help me. I am young (just turned 21!); but was diagnosed with sudden quite high hypertension (sometimes up to 160/128); which till today; doctors are adamant is caused by a secondary cause. But nobody can put a finger to what is the secondary cause. Have no family history; am female; and my BMI is 20. Have been a top student all this while; and have represented my state for national's in debate. Also active in public speeches etc. Lately; have started trembling real bad. Used to get trembling when I had to speak in front of public; but it goes away about a minute into speech. But now I tremble all the way; until the podium shakes; and even 15 minutes AFTER speech; I still tremble so badly I cant hold even a bottle of water. It affects mostly my left side of the body. Like yestedray; all through the day; my left thumb was trembling; even when I was resting my entire arm on the table. If I apply pressure to my thumb to stay still; I can see the vein (or whatever you call it) pulsating. Is this just a bad case of anxiety or is something wrong? One of the doctors was worried about my trembling; while another said ""anxious people tremble"". Tested negative for thyroid disorders; pheochromocytoma. Appreciate your time for reading this far.

Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96).

85,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hi; Im 27; 250lbs; 5'-11"" and I work out about 5 days a week; mostly cardio jogging and Anaerobic sprinting. My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor or doing? Im really worried that my heart will stop or that I have an underlying issue.

86,Amlodipine+hypertension,I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,,Male,im 25 year old weight 169 im 5 10 my blood type a i consum lot red meat im slight activ i play soccer week go walk 3 day week i would like give brief histori medic issu within past 6 year get advic back i 19 i got bad flu i never experienc life i sick two week even i got better i felt hand leg numb i felt general weak sinc i start experienc pressur pain left side chest this someth new a month later i went doctor check i told blood pressur pre hypertens rang start 2009 i see doctor regular tri differ bp medic current im two medic one amlodipin besyl 75 mg norvasc medic paroxetin hcl 20 mg i take daili everi time i saw doctor bp still high 150s 90s surpris suggest i tri 24 hour bp monitor i result interest 98 time bp 14090 4 read high i also done two ekg chest xray differ blood test chest mri result normal i also refer cardiologist ekg i told heart perfect fine noth wrong could tell caus pain can blood pressur caus pain do i go heartrel test what els i need order get ride pain is someth els caus pain i would appreci help pleas let know need info

91,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi Everyone; I'm 41 male with history of hypertension. My BP stays around 170/100. Highest was recorded 176/110. I have been on Telmisartan 40mg for few weeks but it killed my sex drive entirely. I stopped taking it & gradually recovered from low libido. Also i've noticed a general decline in libido & an onset of ED after i crossed age 40. Now my libido is not that strong as it used to be 4 years back even without medicine. I discussed this with my cardiologist & he says it must have been something else as ARB's don't affect libido. Now he has prescribed me a combination drug (telmisartan 40mg + amlodipine 5mg) once a day. I'm really worried if it would again target my libido in a negative way. Please share you experiences & expertise to combat this side effect that makes you life so dull & boring.

93,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 20 and was diagnosed with pretty high hypertension (140~160/90~110) last year; of sudden onset. I am on Diovan 160mg (Valsartan) and Norvasc 5mg(Amlodipine); both once a day. BP is controlled most times of the day. Doctors initially thought I had thyrotoxicosis; as I had the symptoms and negative history for hypertension; and my BMI is 20.5. Tests showed normal levels of TSH; T4 and T3. My tremors of both hands; palpitations and sweaty palms are kinda getting more obvious. Morover; I seem to be getting cramps here and there; and my fingers get all tingly and numb. And I seem to urinating a whole lot more. Is it possible the thyroid tests were a false negative? Or could it be that the Valsartan I'm on is causing some deficiency in my body (like Potassium)? I tested negative for Pheochromocytoma. Please advise.

95,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am posting this for my 62 year old mother who generally feels well but has bouts of a condition that causes the following: -her head feel like it weighs 1000 pounds -terrible pain in her chest and this last time the pain was also on the right side of her lower back. -Her blood pressure spikes and her doctor puts her in the hospital; doctors have trouble stabilizing it once she gets to the hospital. She has been hospitalized 3 times in the last 3 years. The last time she was hospitalized it took 3 days to bring down her blood pressure which was at 180/120. Also the last time she was hospitalized in addition to chest pain she also had extreme pain on the right side of her lower back to the point where she could not bend over. She takes a daily dose of 20mg of Accupril and has for years. Except for when she has bouts of this condition her blood pressure is normal and she feels and looks very healthy. The attacks come without warning and no reason for them has been given. She feels absolutely awful when they come. She usually walks 3.5 miles per day and has for a year and feels well. After her last hospitalization she was sent home with Amlodipine Besylate 5MG. Each time she was treated she had a battery of blood work (numerous vials) in an attempt to find the cause. She was checked for a heart attack and also had a stress test. None of these have pinpointed a cause. She was also given needles to try and being down her blood pressure; I don't know the names of what they were. The pain in her chest is below breast; by rib cage. Each time she is sent home after her blood pressure is finally stabilized. After 6 months or sometimes a year it all comes back again without warning.

97,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather ""sloppy"" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms?

98,Amlodipine+hypertension,"For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the ""world famous"" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it ""stabs and jabs""; another doctor called it ""electrical discharge headaches""; another doctor called it ""cluster headaches"". A previous doctor prescribed ""indomethecin""; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide.

99,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I have had 2 ECG's done; one back in January 2001 and the other just this week. 11 months apart. The first was fine; with no problems. The second (last week) shows 'Probable LVH' Now; I am concerned that this has happened with 11 months; I have been under alot of stress but blood pressure has been OK. I have found this out as I have recently been getting adrenaline rushes (sweats) after stabbing pains in the chest and general chest discomfort; mainly at rest in the evening. Should be I concerned as a 28 year old male?; not overweight - though big built and no family history of problems - More a fan of the pub than the gym to my disgrace. I figure that im not going to just keel over any minute; otherwise the doc would have taken more drastic measures than refering me to a specialist.

100,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Mom 72; Singapore. Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.)

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

101,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 19 year old otherwise healthy patient with symptoms that started about 5 months ago. My daily symptoms include racing heartbeat; palpitations; headache; dizziness; near-syncope upon standing; fatigue; nausea and hypertension. I have been tested for any thyroid problems; or endocrine problems and the tests came back normal. I am on Amlodipine 10mg daily for the blood pressure; but it is persistant and runs about 140/100 usually. I have had a 48 hour holter which showed a max HR of 176; min of 44 and normal sinus rhythm. Had a few EKGs that were normal except a short PR interval; echo was normal; and most recently had a tilt table test. Nothing was remarkable about the test until they administered sublingual Nitroglycerin spray; which prompted a HR increase from 86 to 140 bpm immediatly. All my symptoms came about at once and I nearly passed out so they stopped the test. Blood pressure stayed about the same throughout. My doctor was unable to attend so I am curious in the mean time about these findings on the test. My EP has suggested he thought it was probably Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia; but possibly POTS.

102,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm 46 years old. I have been taking medication (Ramipril 2.5mg; Amlodipine 5mg) for essential hypertension for the past 7 years. Blood pressure is normal whenever I get it tested. Is it necessary to continue this medication for the rest of my life. My doctor says that any change or reduction of medication is to be considered only after regular and more frequent(daily) blood pressure monitoring. Presently I'm not in a position to get it monitiored. I'm given to understand that the blood pressure monitors available in the market are not very accurate which rules out my own taking blood pressure daily. .I've no other problems (like diabetes or obesity etc).

103,Amlodipine+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system? I don't eat red meat or pork and I eat lots of veggies so other than diet; are there alternatives that could help me reduce my BP that I may not be aware of (other than exercise; which I do 7-days a week) and a low sodium diet?,2011,2011,42.0,Female,my heart feel like race time didnt happen prior start atenolol 5year ago i 100mg per day i took 12pill 5day 14pill 5day noth ive 7day my dr said dont prescrib atenolol activ peopl got start amlodipin 10mg i allerg i also stop everyth 7day i take drug 14atenolol pill day my blood pressur rang around 14592 w bpm 85 rest im everyth realli wasnt much lower take atenolol number lower i would realli like med free especi heart race way chest feel like heart readi protrud could atenolol use year caus happen subsid eventu how long take atenolol complet leav system i dont eat red meat pork i eat lot veggi diet altern could help reduc bp i may awar exercis i 7day week low sodium diet
104,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; my old tom cat who is 20 and arthritic and fairly deaf has recently gone suddenly blind. We have taken him to the vet who said he has hypertension (he was already on treatment for kidney disease) and he is now on amolodipine. The vet said he has responded well to the kidney treatment and seems otherwise healthy and should adapt to his blindness in 3-4 weeks. My problem is he has given up trying to find his litter tray/food/water and howls (he did this as he went deaf but it is now more frequent). He will stand up and urinate on anything he is sleeping on and I am constantly taking him to his litter tray/ food/ water (He is eating and drinking well once placed there but howls until I check his needs rather than trying to find anything himself). He is generally mopey. In the morning I have to bathe him as he has sat in his own urine. I guess my worry is that I should not be putting him through all this and he will be on his own most of the day as I work full time normally. I would really appreciate advice / guidance / opinion from anybody who has experienced similar. How long should it take for any signs of improvement? I dont want him to be put to sleep unless this is the kindest option for him as he is much loved; but equally I dont want him to suffer.

105,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 62 years old and have been treated for high BP for over 15 years. I have been taking Toporal XR 25 mg. 3x qd; H ydrochlorathizide 5mg 1x qd for the last 2 years. I woke up Tuesday morning with my head spinning; very dizzy. I took my BP and it was 180/111 pulse 55. This whole week it has stayed between 160/100 to higher and the pulse lower than I have ever had. I went to the doctor; could not see my regular doc but saw the one handling urgent care Thursday. My left leg has been very painful for several months; worse behind the knee. She x-rayed my knee and saw arthritis ; which I knew was there. I have arthritis both kinds. Have taken 800 mg Ibuprofen for the pain; try not to take it often as I know it elevates BP and harmful to body. I also take aspirin; tylenol; and wear a Flector pain patch when it gets unbearable. I alternate with the pain meds dont take them the same days. The doctor put me on Tramadol for pain and made an appt. with my regular MD April 5th. I am scared because heart disease runs in my family; hypertension and stroke; some diabetes. I feel it would be wise for me to see my orthopaedist about my leg and see a specialist about my BP; cardiologist maybe. I have a heart murmur have since childhood; leaky valve; mitral valve prolapse. I also take meds for hypothyroid; depression (sertraline hcl); anxiety (PTSD); skelaxin; prn cyclobenzaprine (not with other meds); now tramadol hcl. Can someone validate my concern about waiting?

106,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Since then; every time that I went to doctor; my BP was in pre hypertension and my doctor recommended me to be physically active. Within the last 6 years; I was just not feeling right. I was confused (cloudy mind); experiencing lightheadedness; and dizziness; I felt pain on the left side of my chest radiating to my left shoulder and left hand all the time. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. The overall average was 122/74 and during the awake time; it was 125/77 and during the sleep time; it was 109/60. So he recommended me to continue taking my medications. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. The only thing that was slightly elevated was my cholesterol and doctor recommended me to exercise and do diet change. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. So I’m still taking my two medications but however; I still have the pain on my left chest and left shoulder and hand. One thing I have realized recently is that I’ve been running more and I’ve been feeling a little better. It seems that my pain reduced during my running and a few hours after I run. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,,Male,hi im 25 year old weight 169 im 5 10 my blood type a i consum lot red meat im slight activ i play soccer week go walk 3 day week i would like give brief histori medic issu within past 6 year get advic back i 19 i got bad flu i never experienc life i sick two week even i got better i felt hand leg numb i felt general weak sinc i start experienc pressur pain left side chest this someth new a month later i went doctor check i told blood pressur pre hypertens rang sinc everi time i went doctor bp pre hypertens doctor recommend physic activ within last 6 year i feel right i confus cloudi mind experienc lightheaded dizzi i felt pain left side chest radiat left shoulder left hand time start 2009 i see doctor regular tri differ bp medic current im two medic one amlodipin besyl 75 mg norvasc medic paroxetin hcl 20 mg i take daili everi time i saw doctor bp still high 150s 90s surpris suggest i tri 24 hour bp monitor i result interest 98 time bp 14090 4 read high the overal averag 12274 awak time 12577 sleep time 10960 so recommend continu take medic i also done two ekg chest xray differ blood test chest mri result normal the thing slight elev cholesterol doctor recommend exercis diet chang i also refer cardiologist ekg i told heart perfect fine noth wrong so im still take two medic howev i still pain left chest left shoulder hand one thing i realiz recent ive run ive feel littl better it seem pain reduc run hour i run could tell caus pain can blood pressur caus pain do i go heartrel test what els i need order get ride pain is someth els caus pain i would appreci help pleas let know need info
107,Amlodipine+hypertension,Recently I was dignosed with High Blood Pressure. My previous doctor recognized it was high back in December. I went to a doctor late in May. She diagnosed me with HBP. My readings have been like 156/85 and as high as 167/90. I have been on Benazepril since May. I have felt better ever since taking the medicine no doubt. Not one single headache and I generally feel better. My blood pressure had went down a little on my last vist. It was about 148/84. The doctor still saw the need to put me on another medication; so now im taking Benazepril and Amlodipine. And at times checking my BP myself it has been down to like 127/80. Im only 24 and thats what worries me. I have a family history of High Blood Pressue big time. My Grandad and Dad both had it. My Dads was so high; at the time they couldnt even maintain it. Im also overweight. During my first visit to the doc I weighed about 250 at 6 feet tall. Most of my fat is central; stored in my stomach. Since then Ive been working out and running. I was down to 226 during my last visit. Ive changed by diet up and have become more active. Besides adding another medication; the doc also did a bunch of bloodwork. My CBC and all blood work; including thryoid function and ALL of that other stuff was all normal. Except my urine test. A small amount of protein showed up in my urine. And she recommended that I get an Ultrasound of my kidneys and abdomen. I didnt have the money to get it done between the last 2 visits. And she still wants it done. She kind of worried me big time that somethine may be fatally wrong with my kidneys. It may be my kidneys causing my HBP. Or is it my HBP causing protein in my urine and kidney problems??? Im worried to death now; at only 24 years old. I have a bit of anxiety at times and dont really know what to think. Im having the ulrasound done in a week. What are the common reasons for the problems im having here. Im overweight and have a fam history of HBP. But could my one case be different?? Could my kidneys be failing?? Ive never had any problems really. I get sharp pains in my right side sometimes. Appendicitis was ruled out a while back. My sister also has problems like this as well. I never have problems urinating either. Except I go ALOT when I drink a ton of water or beer. But Ive always been like that. And my mom is like that too. So i never looked into that much.

110,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life.

115,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a male 40 years with slight hypertension for which I am taking S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg). My height is 5 feet 10 inches; weight is 75 kg. I had bad asthma for 2 years which was treated with asthalin inhaler but I no longer have it nor do I use the inhaler or any other medication for asthma. I am a software engineer by profession. Fitnesswise - I can do about 40 pushups and jog for 30 minutes non stop. I have two problems - dry skin and insomnia; listing them both since I am not sure if they are related. The dry skin problem is nothing new I have had dry skin (extreme dandruff) on scalp; beard; etc. but the problem has gotten worse lately. lately the skin under chin becomes reddish (raw) easily after shaving and burns slightly. The other major problem is that I seem to only be able to sleep when I am extremely tired (been without sleep for long time); I also get disturbed sleep; Many times I go to bed at 11 pm but only get sleep at around 4 am; I then wake up at around 1.30 pm. I get very realistic dreams and disturbed sleep; nose gets blocked at night sometimes. After waking up - I dont feel very rested; I have difficulty concentrating; eye lids feel heavy; lazy. I saw a doctor who conducted some tests for the sleep issue. According to the tests - Vitamin; E; D count is low; triglyceride and esinophil count is slightly high. Bp; Sugar; ecg; thyroid are normal. The doctor recommended vitamin D; E supplements and some tablets for the esinophil which I completed the entire course. Another doctor recommended sertagress - 25 (Sertaline HCL 25 mg) and Ativan 1 mg (lorazepam 1 mg) tablets which I took for 6 months but they were not helping; had nasty side effects and I still had sleep issues; thus I tapered them off over 3 months. I am no longer taking sertagress or any sleep medicine. During school time the doctor diagnosed sleep issue to be caused by high blood pressure (hypertension) He recommended S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg) tablets which I am taking even now and since 15 years. My blood pressure is almost always around 130-90. the aggravagated insomnia problem is there for almost 2 years now.

116,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I was told about a year ago that the walls of my left ventricle were slightly thickened. I had a full cardiac workup done. I had extensive blood tests; stress test; echo; holter monitor and ecg. A few months later another echo and then the test were they go down your esophagus to look at the heart. I can't remember the name of it. The last tests showed that the thickness had come down close to normal. The cardiologists I had seen told me I may have had a virus or high blood pressure that caused the problem. Anyway they told me I should be fine and to go on with my normal life and I should not have any problems. My question is that I have done some bodybuilding and am very active. I am 26 with normal blood pressure and cholesteral levels and I do not smoke. I was wondering if I am at a risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest because of this. I have had a lot of anxiety over this and have some skipped heart beats now and then. I am worried when working out or when I am active I am going drop dead. Am at high risk because of the thickened ventricle walls?,2009,2009,25.0,Male,hello i told year ago wall left ventricl slight thicken i full cardiac workup done i extens blood test stress test echo holter monitor ecg a month later anoth echo test go esophagus look heart i cant rememb name the last test show thick come close normal the cardiologist i seen told i may virus high blood pressur caus problem anyway told i fine go normal life i problem my question i done bodybuild activ i 26 normal blood pressur cholester level i smoke i wonder i risk sudden cardiac death cardiac arrest i lot anxieti skip heart beat i worri work i activ i go drop dead am high risk thicken ventricl wall

One year back; by God's grace; my tests were absolutely normal. There was no cause relating to my BP. I am on NEBIVOLOL 2.5 mg & S-AMLODIPINE 2.5mg from last two years. My BP always remains between 130/90 - 160/90 mm Hg. No signs or symptoms are visible at the time of BP increasing time. I just track by BP for personal reasons. Now; I just want to know: What are the chances for it to be of Essential Hypertension? What are the guidelines i should follow and tests i must undergo? What are the side effect of the medicine i am consuming? Should i replace my medicine witth any other more suitable drug? and; What will be the chance of realting my High BP to any particular disease? Please comment on my above concern.

125,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries ""clamped down"" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and ""improper"" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial. I had no insurance when I had the heart attack (husband was out of work and just got a new job) and there is a 9 month waiting period for anything pre-existing...

127,Amlodipine+hypertension,My doctor diagnosed me with anxiety/depression. The thing is; he diagnosed me with this condition after spending only less than 5 minutes in the exam room with me. My concern is that it may actually be my heart. (I recently started a hypertension medicine (amlodipine)). Most times I feel fine. But lately I've been having issues with running out of breath easily with activity (although I am 300lb; so I know that does have something to do with it); occasional chest pressure; and starting today my left arm feels very heavy. I also have been having a churning feeling in my stomach the past 2 days along with indigestion. Since I'm worrying so much about my possible heart problem; my anxiety gets worse. I have a return visit to the doctor on November 28th. It's a very busy office; so getting in sooner is basically out of the question. Any input and reassurance would be greatly appreciated!,2011,2011,23.0,Female,my doctor diagnos anxietydepress the thing diagnos condit spend less 5 minut exam room my concern may actual heart i recent start hypertens medicin amlodipin most time i feel fine but late ive issu run breath easili activ although i 300lb i know someth occasion chest pressur start today left arm feel heavi i also churn feel stomach past 2 day along indigest sinc im worri much possibl heart problem anxieti get wors i return visit doctor novemb 28th it busi offic get sooner basic question ani input reassur would great appreci

129,Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a copy of my treadmill test results. My ST was flat at about 0.9 out to about 90 BPM (V3); then dropped with a near constant slope to -0.9 at about 120 BPM and then dropped with a steeper slope to -3.8 at 142 BPM. The recovery line followed the test line to about 120 BPM and then recoved with a smaller slope to about -.1 at 80 BPM after 11 minutes of recovery time. I did not experience any angina during the test. The angiogram showed three blockages; two in one branch artery at 90 and 75% and the second in another branch artery at 75%. The two blockages are in a branch off of the LAD. The other is in a branch off of the RCA. The 90% block is right at the junction of the branch. I tried to paste a picture showing the locations of the blockages; but would not work. The doctor put me on Amlodipine besylate and Metroprolol. The cardiologist said that my condition is not life threatening as long as I manage my lifestyle.. Can I infer a safe exercise level from the treadmill test results? I am 6' and 196 #. Up to the day of the treadmill I was exercising on a daily basis on the elliptical and rowing machine for 30-45 mintes with my heartrate at 125 to 130 BPM to lose weight and stay in shape. I am coming back from 4 months of sedentary life recovering from a detached retinal requiring multiple procedures to fix. The cardiologist has said that we will reassess the need and benefit for a stent in about 3 weeks with another treadmill and nuclear. I have improved my diet; but can I really expect an improvement in the treadmill results with diet and drugs in one month? The doctor suggested that if I had continued to exercise at the higher BPM; it would have eventually led to a heart attack; suggesting a strong correlation between ST depression and death. If the blockages are addressed with stents; does that mean that mean that my ST depression will be mitigated? If so; does that mean that I can get back to a more rigorous exercise regimen?

130,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at?

131,Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7. Also World Journal of Gastroenterology 2005;11(48):7560-7563 has an article on losartan and fibrosis and there are other articles on the Internet.,2009,2009,,Male,i liver transplant 2000 get cirrhosi follow hepat abvd chemotherapi fail interferon alpha therapi unfortun hcv elimin i ran across articl indic losartancozaar blood pressur medicin may reduc elimin fibrosi i ask doctor chang blood pressur medicin coincid visit detect fibrosi feel stiff liver the hepat stellat cell hscs activ myofibroblastlik cell produc fibrosi angiotensin ii losartan act block angiotensin ii receptor cost 6000 per month medicar vasotec cost 500 per month i wonder enalaprilvasotec angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitor would fibrosi reduc effect losartan sinc stop angiotensin ii form first place work well block receptor angiotensin ii dock cheaper cost i found posit answer chines medic journal 2001 vol 114 no 6 page 5837 also world journal gastroenterolog 2005114875607563 articl losartan fibrosi articl internet
132,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My son started having ""spells"" Jan. 2012 where he would start throwing up; very pale and blotchy; dark circle under his eyes. We would take him to the doctor and they would tell us to take him home and in a full days he would get better. He would but then a few months later it would happen again; he would literally look like he was dying. Finally he was hospitalize at vanderbilt childrens hospital for it cause his BP was extremely to high(181/96). He was finally diagnosed with Hypertension but without a reason.His doctor told me that a reason for high blood pressure could be that he was in pain from something that we couldn't see. They did ever test on him and everything came back normal; he is currently take Amlodipine twice a day; and his bp runs around 120/75 everyday. So it got me thinking...I have the gene HLA-B27 which can be a sign of Ankylosing Spondylitis and was told that more then likely my son would suffer from this as well. So my question is: Is there a link between Ankylosing Spondylitis and High Blood Pressure? Should I have my son tested for AS?

133,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I am a male; 28 yrs old. I started medications for hypertension (amlodipine) and high cholesterol (crestor) in Dec 2013. After seven months on these I developed weird symptoms. I have been suffering from fogginess for the past 9 months. It's a fuzzy feeling in my brain and eyes. I also used to be very fatigued at times to a point where I could barely stand. Apart from this I have gastritis and heartburn though it has got better recently. I also suffered from unexpected weight loss. However currently my weight is more steady. I had all sorts of medical tests done on me. Only recently I was diagnosed with low vitamin D levels (less than 4.2) and low normal vitamin B12. I have stopped my medications for the past two months. However even though other symptoms seems to be getting better my fogginess has been lingering on. Has anybody else got similar experiences?,2015,2015,28.0,Male,hello i male 28 yrs old i start medic hypertens amlodipin high cholesterol crestor dec 2013 after seven month i develop weird symptom i suffer foggi past 9 month it fuzzi feel brain eye i also use fatigu time point i could bare stand apart i gastriti heartburn though got better recent i also suffer unexpect weight loss howev current weight steadi i sort medic test done onli recent i diagnos low vitamin d level less 42 low normal vitamin b12 i stop medic past two month howev even though symptom seem get better foggi linger has anybodi els got similar experi
134,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor.

136,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin?

137,Amlodipine+hypertension,My mother (56+ yrs) is under treatment for Hypothyroidism; Hypertension; Osteoporosis along with Osteo Arthritis. For Hypertension; she had taken Olsar 40 from Feb; 2014 to Dec; 2014; after which our medicine doctor has changed it to Olmat 20 AM; which she has been taking since past 3-months; during which most of her BP readings (using mercury device) are either 120/80 or 130/80. However; 2-3 days back; she started feeling the surrounding very hot & uncomfortable with complete loss of appetite & thirst. Also; she felt to have indigestion & a little fever (99.5); which got normalized after a day after taking medicines like crocin & pundinhara. However; during these 2-3 days whenever we measured her BP (using Omron electronic monitor) most of her readings are around 125/80 with pulse between 80-85; which is quite higher than her usual electronic BP readings 110/70 & pulse 70-75. Also; since the mercury BP readings are usually 10-15 units higher than that of electronic readings; I am worried whether these 125/80 readings correspond to mercury readings higher than 140/90; which means her BP is not really under control. Can you please help us with the below mentioned queries - 1) Do you feel her discomfort was related to indigestion problem or; could it be related to higher BP or heart issues ? 2) She usually takes her BP medicine (Olmat 20 AM) around 9:30 in the morning. Usually her morning BP (before medicine) is 5-10 units higher than evening BP. Is this normal or; sign of any heart problem ? 3) Do you see any need for BP medicine change or more investigations here ? 4) If she encounters similar problems in future; what is most advisable to do ? 5) Just to note: her FBS was 103 in Dec; 2014 & 92 in Feb; 2015 after certain dietary changes; although PPBS was normal (90). Is this slightly higher tendency of FBS related to her situation ? 6) Couple of weeks back she had fever with cold/cough (URTI); after which she was given antibiotic by our medicine doctor & asked to stop her calcium medicine (Shelcal CT) for 10-days. Could it be related to her BP increase since her BP medicine contains Amlodipine ?,2014,2015,,Male,my mother 56 yrs treatment hypothyroid hypertens osteoporosi along osteo arthriti for hypertens taken olsar 40 feb 2014 dec 2014 medicin doctor chang olmat 20 am take sinc past 3month bp read use mercuri devic either 12080 13080 howev 23 day back start feel surround hot uncomfort complet loss appetit thirst also felt indigest littl fever 995 got normal day take medicin like crocin pundinhara howev 23 day whenev measur bp use omron electron monitor read around 12580 puls 8085 quit higher usual electron bp read 11070 puls 7075 also sinc mercuri bp read usual 1015 unit higher electron read i worri whether 12580 read correspond mercuri read higher 14090 mean bp realli control can pleas help us mention queri 1 do feel discomfort relat indigest problem could relat higher bp heart issu 2 she usual take bp medicin olmat 20 am around 930 morn usual morn bp medicin 510 unit higher even bp is normal sign heart problem 3 do see need bp medicin chang investig 4 if encount similar problem futur advis 5 just note fbs 103 dec 2014 92 feb 2015 certain dietari chang although ppbs normal 90 is slight higher tendenc fbs relat situat 6 coupl week back fever coldcough urti given antibiot medicin doctor ask stop calcium medicin shelcal ct 10day could relat bp increas sinc bp medicin contain amlodipin
138,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello all; I have had the pain for about 8 years and docs have not been able to id. So; thought I might se if anyone has any other thoughts. I have pain when I stand; walk; seat or lay down (this is e order of level of pain as well - standing is the worse). When I stand the bottom of my feet will throb. Sometimes most of the bottom and sometimes I will get certain points like the heel or by the big toe that almost feels like a cigarette burn. Other time like when I seat from inside e ankle to my whole foot will burn/tingle. It's almost like the pressure on the back of my leg causes this. Also; sometimes if you run your hand from the top of my leg to the ankle you can feel;it go from warm to very cld at the ankle. This has been gradually getting worse over the past 8 years and I have seen a ton of doctors. General doc; nuralagist; chiro; podiatrist; homeopathy; acupuncture; pulmutalagist;. I have had MRI leg; ankle; back; X-ray; blood pressure test; nerve conduction test; lots of blood work with nothing being found. I have also trid lots of drugs neurotics; cymbalta; niacin; vitamins like the Bs and other.

139,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?",2009,2009,,Female,medic histori my mom age 71live singapor histori hypertens she hospit 509 drug hypertens medic methyldopa induc cholestasi prescrib new dr while hospit diagnos atrial fibril 2de result normal lv size systol function no rwma lvef 59 normal pasp 26mmhg trivial aortic tricuspid regurig aspirin 100 mg prescrib ecg attach her hospit chest apsit result the heart size accur assess appear enlarg there mild promin hilar vessel suggest mild congest she recruit warfarin vs apixaban doubl blind clinic trial start treatment aug4 2009 we later found warfarin w dosag unknown us 14 day wafarin treatment fell caus fall unknown accord friend walk right next mom stop walk forward drop floor hit back head she conscious mobil initi repeat brain ct scan hospit day due drop gcn the second ct scan shown much larger bleed due blood thin effect warfarin she becam semiconsci loss sens control left side ct brain result 1 acut subarachnoid subdur haemorrhag 2 pneumocephalus occipit bone fractur left haemotympanum blood product sphenoid sinus 3 haemorrhag contus left occipit lobe old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus her inr 35 due warfarin luckili extens rehab abl regain 90 physic mental abil she discharg 911 the blood test sept 14 visit cardiologist haematolog within rang platelet clump note biochemistri non fast within rang non clinic signific on follow visit neurologist leg check neurologist indic doe tendenc embol and brain ct scan done sept discharg hospit show blood clot brain almost gone unlik alzheim her bp 11012080 rang she 3 bp medic one stomach 1 amlodipin besil 10 mg 2 lisinopril 20 mg3 atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 20 mg stomach on 928 cardiologist resum warfarin 1 mgday start despit request leav trial switch aspirin when request echocardiogram drs respons we need to do a transesophag echocardiogram a mild invas procedur to detect clot reliabl which is not feasibl howev even if no clot was seen the risk for clot format is still present do an echocardiogram will not chang manag with question 1 given patient neardeath bleed safe continu bloodthin therapi we famili favor use aspirin therapi af mitig risk thromboembol oppos continu warfarin but given near death brainble use warfarin wise use ani blood thinner even low dose aspirin 2 should patient echocardiogram determin natur extent clot ismay form due af what type echocardiogram transthorac transesophag what test see upper chamber mother heart help us determin extent build clot therefor help us form evalu true risk profil embol event due af
140,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I had a kidney stone (6.5 mm) removed via ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy on 11/18/05 because it became lodged at the ureto-vesicular junction after 12 days of excruciating right flank pain (6-8 hrs. per day) as it passed all the way down the right ureter. The day after the surgery; I experienced a different pain in the RUQ of the abdomen extending under and into the rib cage; back; and right shoulder area. I had a contrast helical(spiral) CT scan done on 11/21/05; and everything was normal except for sclerotic lesions found on my 4th and 7th left ribs (opposite side of the pain); which were believed to be bone islands by the radiologist. I had a bone scan done on 12/6/05; which showed two ""hot spots"" on my 10th left rib; which I later found out via a complete skeletal survey and a second reading of the CT scan (as they were not found on the initial read) to be two small sclerotic lesions on the 10th left rib (in addition to two small sclerotic lesions on the 7th left rib; one sclerotic lesion on the 4th left rib; and one sclerotic lesion on the right distal femur). The nuclear medicine physician's report simply stated that the findings were ""suggestive of a benign process"". I had an abdominal ultrasound done on 12/21/05; and the liver; pancreas; and gall bladder were seen as normal; except that a gallstone was found (without ductal dilatation; w/o widening of gall bladder walls; etc. and thus; was adjudged not to be a potential source of my RUQ adominbal/right rib cage pain). As shown below; lab tests were done before surgery (on 11/17/05); on 12/5/05; on 12/19/05; and; finally; on 1/10/06. The reason for the gap between the last two tests was to allow time for the liver enzymes to normalize; as multiple physical exams; CT scan; and abdominal ultrasound seemed to rule out liver; pancreatic; gall bladder; or kidney cancer; and the source of the elevated liver enzymes was hypothesized to be medicine (which was discontinued on 11/25/05). A colonoscopy was done on 11/28/05; and an upper endoscopy was done on 1/4/06; both of which were perfectly normal. Further; the cystoscopy done in conjunction with the ureteroscopy on 11/17/05 seemed to rule out bladder cancer. My PSA level is about 0.8 (ref. range 0-4); and thus; seems to rule out prostate cancer (along with a DRE done by my urologist). My main problem is that I am still experiencing no diminution of my RUQ abdominal/right rib cage/right upper shoulder pain (after almost 2 months); and my liver enzymes became significantly elevated between 11/17/05 and 12/19/05; although they seem to have come down significantly between 12/19/05 and 1/10/06; as seen below (AST down from 53 to 32 (ref. range 3-50 U/L) (ALT down from 209 to 77 (ref. range 3/60 U/L). My principal QUESTION is; in light of the above facts; and the below lab results; can I definitively rule out liver cancer? In this connection; would a liver tumor too small to be detected by CT scan and ultrasound cause the AST and ALT levels to rise significantly from well within normal limits the day before the surgery to well outside of normal limits (at least with respect to the ALT)about a month later (i.e.; from 11/17/05 to 12/19/05); with a significant rise between 11/17/05 and 12/05/05? Would a liver tumor cause the AST and ALT levels to rise as they did in a one month period; and then fall (although the ALT is still mildly elevated) in the next one month period; when they were perfectly normal just prior to the first one month period? Would a liver tumor cause pain before a rise were seen in the AST and ALT levels? Would a liver tumor cause pain without being detectable via ultrasound and helical CT scan? Based on my below lab results; can you provide any explanation as to what may have caused my abnormal LFTs? What recommendations do you have regarding further lab tests; imaging studies; etc.? (BTW: The medications I was given post-surgery were Cipro (2 tablets per day for 6 days; oxycodone 3 5 mg tablets per day for 7 days; and phenazopyridine (2 200mg tablets per day for 3 days). After a severe hypertensive episode on 12/5/05 (180/112 blood pressure); I was prescribed and have been taking ever since; Amlodipine (Norvasc) (1 5 mg tablet per day) and Ramipril (Altace) (1 2.5 mg capsule per day). A CT-Angiogram was also performed on 12/8/05 to rule out renovascular hypertension as the cause of my blood pressure. The findings were normal. Also; several blood and urine tests have been taken to rule out pheochromocytoma; multiple myeloma; and carcinoid tumors. All those tests were negative. 11/17/05: ALT: 32 (reference range 3-60 U/L) AST: 16 (reference range 3-50 U/L) (this was taken one day prior to ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy to remove impacted kidney stone) Alkaline Phosphatase: 82 (ref. range 20-125 U/L)LDH: 171 (100-250 U/L) GGT: 59 (ref. range 3-80 U/L)Cholesterol: 162 (ref. range <200 MG/DL) Triglycerides: 82 (ref. range <150 MG/DL) HDL Cholesterol: 50 (ref. range > 39 MG/DL) LDL Cholesterol: 96 (ref. range 0-100 MG/DL) VLDL Cholesterol: 16 (ref. range 8-40 MG/DL) (CBC;

141,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hello everyone! A quick review of what I know so far. I am a 33 year old obese white male; smoker; with hypertension. I was recently diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. I am on metoprolol; amlodipine and 81mg aspirin. I take simvastatin for my high sensitivity c-reactive protein number (8.9). I was recently given nitrostat for chest pain. This past week; I was put on a 48 hour holter monitor to see; as my cardiologist put it; why I had so many skipped beats. What follows is the narrative: ""Monitoring started at 2:04 pm and continued for 47 hours 59 minutes. Average heart rate was 73 BPM. The minimum heart rate was 39 BPM at 3:38 AM. The maximum heart rate was 136 BPM occuring at 9:05 PM. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 3 beats; of which; 3 were in single PVCs. Ventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of less than one VE per hour. The patients rhythm included 12hr 34 min 34 sec of bradycardia. The slowest single episode of bradycardia occurred at 3:38:19 AM D1; lasting 3 min 53 sec; with minimum heart rate of 39 BPM. The patient's rhythm included 2 hr 10 min 43 sec of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia occurred at 9:04:02 PM D2 lasting 5 min 21 sec; with maximum heart rate of 136 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 1836 beats of which; 39 were in 5 runs; 12 were in atrial couplets; 1545 were single PACs; 7 were in bigeminy; 233 were in trigeminy. There were 2 dropped beats. The longest R-R interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest N-N interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest supraventricular run occurred at 9:49:35 PM D! consisting of 26 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 138 BPM. The fastest supraventricular run occurred at 1:24:33 AM D1; consisting of 3 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 169 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of 38.2 SVEs per hour TECH COMMENTS: Sinus rhythm with episodes of 2nd degree AV block; rates of 39 to 136 BPM. Rare PVCs without VT. Occasional PACs with 5 atrial runs; the longest was 26 beats and the fastest was 169 BPM. No pauses seen. Patient reported symptoms of palpitations and chest pain; which correlated with sinus rhythm. My cardiologist wants to run a sleep study. Obviously the 2nd degree AV block is of the greatest concern. The nurses told me it was of the type 2 variety. My question is that I had a sleep study done 4 years ago and it was negative for sleep apnea. Is a new sleep study warranted at this time?",2010,2012,33.0,Male,hello everyon a quick review i know far i 33 year old obes white male smoker hypertens i recent diagnos hypertens cardiomyopathi includ left ventricular hypertrophi left atrial enlarg i metoprolol amlodipin 81mg aspirin i take simvastatin high sensit creactiv protein number 89 i recent given nitrostat chest pain this past week i put 48 hour holter monitor see cardiologist put i mani skip beat what follow narrat monitor start 204 pm continu 47 hour 59 minut averag heart rate 73 bpm the minimum heart rate 39 bpm 338 am the maximum heart rate 136 bpm occur 905 pm ventricular ectop activ consist 3 beat 3 singl pvcs ventricular ectop beat occur rate less one ve per hour the patient rhythm includ 12hr 34 min 34 sec bradycardia the slowest singl episod bradycardia occur 33819 am d1 last 3 min 53 sec minimum heart rate 39 bpm the patient rhythm includ 2 hr 10 min 43 sec tachycardia the fastest singl episod tachycardia occur 90402 pm d2 last 5 min 21 sec maximum heart rate 136 bpm supraventricular ectop activ consist 1836 beat 39 5 run 12 atrial couplet 1545 singl pac 7 bigemini 233 trigemini there 2 drop beat the longest rr interv 23 second occur 60046 am d1 the longest nn interv 23 second occur 60046 am d1 the longest supraventricular run occur 94935 pm d consist 26 beat maximum heart rate 138 bpm the fastest supraventricular run occur 12433 am d1 consist 3 beat maximum heart rate 169 bpm supraventricular ectop beat occur rate 382 sves per hour tech comment sinus rhythm episod 2nd degre av block rate 39 136 bpm rare pvcs without vt occasion pac 5 atrial run longest 26 beat fastest 169 bpm no paus seen patient report symptom palpit chest pain correl sinus rhythm my cardiologist want run sleep studi obvious 2nd degre av block greatest concern the nurs told type 2 varieti my question i sleep studi done 4 year ago negat sleep apnea is new sleep studi warrant time
142,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ? I have read numerous articles regarding the dangers of statins and am very concerned.",2009,2010,,Female,my mom 72 year old femal live singapor diagnos hypertens 8 year ago initi control via wellknown bp medic see medic longer prescrib unknown reason in 509 hospit due methyldopa induc cholestasi diagnos atrial fibril in 809 14 day warfarin therapi fell caus unknown suffer skull fractur caus acut subarachnoid subdur hemorrhag she initi paralyz left side she recov almost 90 3 week on request switch warfarin aspirin in 1209 open cholecystectomi due acut cholecyst pigment gallston in 510 minor stroke her eyesight becam blurri vomit twice lost motor control especi left side she discharg hospit 1 2 day she back warfarin cardiologist recruit apaxiban vs warfarin clinic trial back 809 for 2 3 month 510 stroke mom suffer pain left shoulder make difficult sleep night shes alway difficulti fall asleep the new medic simvastatin warfarin seem lessen shoulder pain sad suffer slowli decreas lucid 809 hospit etiolog uncertain she monitor bp 3 time day upon awaken breakfast around 140 in afternoon even around 120 she take bp medicin breakfast ecg result 409 sinus bradycardia atrial prematur complex 509 af t abnorm 809 hospit cns hemorrhag sinus rhythm 1009 af t st abnorm medic befor 510 stroke 30 amlodipin besyl 5 mg lisinopril 40 mg atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 40 mg aspirin 100 mg medic after 510 stroke simvastatin 10mg warfarin she risk chad 1 1 her stroke symptom indic neuro problem shouldnt neurologist main dr 2 was stroke like secondari blood clot ie blockag hemorrhag due capillari wall weak secondari either genet propens vascular wall compromis due long term hypertens how determin what test done 3 should statin drug rather regular timetest bp med like origin bp med list dont statin danger sideeffect what proper treatment regimen shouldnt take bp med statin especi warfarin and arent blood thinner possibl contraind histori could reduct pain shoulder caus antiinflammatori effect statin i read numer articl regard danger statin concern
143,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 60-year old woman; weigh 105 lbs; exercise regularly. I take meds for hypertension and cholesterol and I also take synthroid. About 6 months ago I started a low carb diet for my overall health because heart disease is in my family. I cut out processed foods; bread; white potatoes; pasta; crackers; candy; cereal; desserts. My diet consists of salads with reduced fat dressings; salmon; chicken; tuna; occasional steak; green vegetables; occasional sweet potato; nuts; cottage cheese; greek yogurt and Atkins bars. I recently had a blood test and my fasting blood sugar went from 87 to 96; and my A1C rose from 5.8 to 5.9. I was shocked because my diet has not included simple carbs for the past 6 months. Can you give me some insight as to what may be driving up my fasting gluclose and A1C if I'm not eating high carb foods? I do not cheat on my diet and I exercise 3-4 days per week. I would be happy to adjust my diet again; but I'm at a loss as to what can be causing this.

148,Amlodipine+hypertension,My aunt is now switching from Viread (300mg) to Baraclude (0.5mg). She had been on Viread for about 2 years but her kidney functions have worsened. Our hepatologist and nephrologist think this is happening because of the nephrotoxicity of Viread; which affects some patients. In switching to Baraclude 0.5mg; she is supposed to take Baraclude every other day while still taking Viread everyday for 3 weeks. After that; she'll switch completely to Baraclude. No more Viread. Is this transitioning from Viread to Baraclude typical? On alternate days; she'll be taking full doses of both Viread and Baraclude. Is this not toixc? I understand that some people do combination therapy with the two drugs at full doses simultaneously. But it does surprise me that this is the way to do it.,2009,2012,47.0,Male,my aunt switch viread 300mg baraclud 05mg she viread 2 year kidney function worsen our hepatologist nephrologist think happen nephrotox viread affect patient in switch baraclud 05mg suppos take baraclud everi day still take viread everyday 3 week after shell switch complet baraclud no viread is transit viread baraclud typic on altern day shell take full dose viread baraclud is toixc i understand peopl combin therapi two drug full dose simultan but surpris way
149,Amlodipine+hypertension,Is anyone taking metoprolol? It's driving me nuts! I do have anxiety disorder. And of course knowing they gave me this to lower my heart rate makes me nervous. And with my anxiety disorder I am taking my blood pressure every hour. I know that doesn't help.

150,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I was on Prozac 20 years ago for a period of a year for post-natal anxiety disorder....it worked well for me then. I am now 45 years old & on blood pressure meds...I've had a very traumatic few years which resulted in post traumatic stress; panic attacks & claustraphobia. I bacame obsessed that this stress would all make my bp go up again. My doc prescribed xanax to take if & when I need; altho I only take if absolutely neccessary and has then prescribed Prozac for me as I was on it before with no bad side effects...HOWEVER this time it's giving me prickling skin which is very uncomfortable; nightmares; sweating; shaking; very dry mouth & bad tummy upset. I've tried to persevere like she recommended but the side effects aren't lifting....I'm worried that the anxiety of the side affects is actually going to make me worse & not better! I'm also worried that this added anxiety won't help my bp....however I do feel I really need a med that stays in my system long term rather than just a quick fix calmer which is also addictive....any advice would be welcome especially from anyone that may have had similar probs.

152,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I've experienced 3 episodes of tachycardia while sleeping in the last week. I feel a fluttery feeling in my chest with a ""burst"" of tachycardia causing my heart rate to peak at 140 BPM for approx 3-4 minutes. My doctor placed me on a 48 hr holter monitor (wasn't able to catch any of the episodes; of course) and the results were PVC's and sinus tachycardia which my doctor says are benign. She's ordered a stress test to cover all bases and told me that if the stress test is normal she wasn't going to worry about. By the way; I have suffered from panic disorder and lived med free up until Nov 99. I've been on 20 mgs of Paxil.

153,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; ""Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis""; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record.

154,Amlodipine+hypertension,My poor girl Zola has been lethargic and disinterested in her kibble off and on this month. Two nights ago I bought a bag of a different food to see if she would try it. I mixed it with some old food and she ate the whole bowl right away. That was around 6 pm. I work grave shift so I got home Saturday morning and took her out to potty. Her eyes were both covered by the lower eyelid membrane and she seemed disoriented; and confused. I helped her find her way back inside and tried to calm her down as she was trembling. When I checked her gums they were very pale. I've never seen this; so I rushed her off to the vet. She perked up some (she loves car rides) but had an accident there.VET diagnosed her with renal failure... Creatine was supposed to be 1.8 and hers is 8.1. The BUN number was supposed to be under 29 and she's at a 90. I'm terrified. She has blood in herurine and the protein Is high. Vet gave her an IV catheter and sent her home with me to return in the morning. At pickup She was prescribed Hills Prescription Diet k/d and some aluminum hydroxide gel to take with it to keep her phosphorous levels down. She hates the syringe of the gel; but ate the canned Hills with vigor so that was promising! She spent last night curled up on the couch with us. She enjoyed her new food again this morning and her stool was a better consistency. At 9:00 AM today Zola returned to the vet for more IV fluids as planned. They re ran bloodwork and also checked her electrolyte levels to see where her numbers were. She stayed at the vet all day receiving fluids. She threw up once and had a little diarrhea there. Her numbers haven't improved. She will return tomorrow for another round of fluids and tests. I am so worried and not ready to make any decisions. I know the vet is doing everything they can.

155,Amlodipine+hypertension,A recent paper studied the effect of most FDA approved drugs on the inhibition of NTCP; the now known entry receptor for HBV. Ezetimibe was found to have a 50%inhibition conc of 25micromolar; while irbesartan; a commonly used angiotensin inhibitor to reduce blood pressure; was found to inhibit at 11.9 micromolar. Both compounds have similar MW; but irbesartan is given at up to 300mg per day; while exetimibe is dosed at 10mg. Thus the combination of 30fold higher approved dose and the double micromolar inhibition potency makes; in theory; irbesartan 60 fold more potent to inhibit Hbv entry. Of course; binding of these drugs to plasma proteins could cause substsntial differences in the available concentration on the hepatocyte membrane receptor; and the pharmacokinetics could further influence the in vivo efficscy. Tests in chimeric mice are urgently needed to determine the in vivo efficacy of this common; mostly beneficial medication on HBV reinfection inhibition.,2011,2013,,Male,a recent paper studi effect fda approv drug inhibit ntcp known entri receptor hbv ezetimib found 50inhibit conc 25micromolar irbesartan common use angiotensin inhibitor reduc blood pressur found inhibit 119 micromolar both compound similar mw irbesartan given 300mg per day exetimib dose 10mg thus combin 30fold higher approv dose doubl micromolar inhibit potenc make theori irbesartan 60 fold potent inhibit hbv entri of cours bind drug plasma protein could caus substsntial differ avail concentr hepatocyt membran receptor pharmacokinet could influenc vivo efficsci test chimer mice urgent need determin vivo efficaci common most benefici medic hbv reinfect inhibit
156,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Dear Doctor; I am writing to you seeking for some practical advice; and I hope you can help me. I have outlined the problems as detailed as I can; and have included all drug (brand names in parenthesis); in case of cross-country differences. *** Hypertension; Tachycardia: I am now 22 years old; and 2 years ago; during a regular medical check-up; the gynaecologist found that I had a resting blood pressure of 140/90. Was a regular blood donor for 3 years (and on holiday); so the BP-spike was an anomaly. She subsequently refered me a to physician-neurologist. An ABPM was done; and the highest reading of BP was 158/128. Tachycardia was another feature on the ABPM (with HR as high as 160; not-under-strenous-activity). Note: No feeling of anxiousness during the high heart rate. I have very minimal family history of HTN (parents have slightly elevated bp; after age 45); am active; have a BMI of 21; and borderline Cholesterol. Have been through the mill for ALL tests to check for secondary HTN; and the only abnormality is high (sitting upright for half an hour) renin at 17.0 (Range: 0.2-2.8); although Aldosterone was normal. Doppler U/S and Renal MRA showed no Renal Artery Stenosis. Am now on Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg; Valsartan (Diovan) 160 mg; Propranolol (Inderal) 80 mg; all once daily. Doctors are ambivalent about diagnosis: Some belief it is essential HTN; while some belief we just havent hit the nail on the head. *** Tremors: A few months after that; I developed severe tremors of my hands; and when fatigued; of the legs as well; to the extent I cannot walk. I cannot write properly unless with medication (I am on Propranolol; 80 mg; once daily) as my hands will tremble and I have to grip my pen tightly in order to maintain penmanship; as my hands also feel weak (only confined to fine motor movement like writing; using a tweezer etc). My eyelids and lips also occasionally tremble (thyroid function normal). There are also occasions every day when individual appendages and digits twitch for no reason (kinda like a sudden jerk?). *** Problems emptying bladder: 3 months ago; I started having problems with my bladder; where I had to visit the bathroom a few times before I 'finished'. I also have problem initiating urine flow despite the bladder feeling heavy; and have perisistent dribbling at the end. The bladder problem became troublesome when I kept waking up at night. I initially thought I was having a urinary tract infection; but urinalysis showed no bacteria. Two pre+post-micturition Ultrasounds were done; the first showed incomplete emptying (bladder at that time was very full); while the second (a bladder which was quite empty) showed complete emptying. Note: Blood/Urine sugar consistently normal. I also realise that at the peak of my urinary activity (when I keep going to the toilet every half an hour); I have a lot of saliva pooling in my mouth; at the bottom (the rest of my mouth feels very dry); and I have to consciously remind myself to swallow. *** Haywire Blood Pressure; when ill: A month ago; I was admitted for an acute nasopharyngitis+otitis media+severe migraine. During hospitalisation; I was given Oxymethazoline Hydrochloride (Afrin) to clear the nasal congestion and IV-Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Early the next morning; my BP dropped to a surprising 70/40 (without anti-Hypertensives). I was not purging; or vomiting; and had maintained normal fluid intake. The BP stubbornly refused to climb despite the administration of IV-fluids; and I remained in hospital for 4 days. (Note: Doctor ordered me to off all anti-Hypertensives; and one week later; my BP went up to (the highest) 177/135)) *** Pupillary Reflex: Upon discharge; I collapsed at home; which the doctor diagnosed as vasovagal. Upon examination; she found that my pupils were strangely more dilated than normal (to penlight and accommodation); in absence of pain. I was refered to a Opthalmologist; who found no problems; using his ""super torchlight"" (he didn't use a penlgiht). The first doctor thinks there is still cause for concern; because my pupils used to constrict properly (to penlight and accommodation); and she has been my physician for the past 3 years. For a few years; I have had a problem focusing when I read (if for a long time) books/articles/passages etc wtih small print. I find that my central vision will suddenly disappear (peripheral vision is intact); and I have problems when reading from line to line (like the vision jumps). My prescription lens power has been checked yearly and they have remained at the same level. Is it possibly caused by accommodation problems? *** Differential Diagnosis: My physician has put a few things into the basket of possible differential diagnosis; and I am wiritng to you to ask if you have encountered anything even remotely similar to my case. Among the condition my physician suspects (subject to further discussion) are: 1) Idiopathic Pandysautonomia 2) Idiopathic Dysautonomia 3) (Purely Autonomic) CIDP My physician admits she isn't very familiar with these conditions as she has yet to see a full-blown case in practise. .. She suspects my immune system is always active. I have been 'plagued' with recurrent acute tonsilitis for years (leading to the eventual removal after going into a near-Quinsy emergency in 2006) and now without my tonsils I get other infections of the upper respiratory tract; have also had recurrent allergies which attack my eyes; ears; nose; skin since young. She thinks it is worthwhile doing an LP to check for oligoclonal bands. One note of interest: I had measles at the age of 9 months (to which the pediatrician said I did not need the MMR vaccination; since I had measles); mumps at 14 years old; and received my Rubella-vaccination at the age of (I think) 15. I read somewhere that the measles virus can remain dormant in the body for years and come back and wreck havoc years later. Is that true? *** Pressing Question: 1) Is there a reason for us to continue looking for an answer to my problems; and if yes; are we along the right path? I don't believe I am stressed out with life and neither does my physician or family; but is stress a possible factor in all the above symptoms? I am open to the possibility =) *** I know this letter is very long; and I thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you.

158,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 25 years old and very healthy. I am not overweight; I work out regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke. For the past 3 months I have been having severe swelling in my left foot and ankle. At times the swelling continues into my calf and causes a discomfort. I first noticed the swelling after I got home from the gym one evening. I took my shoe off and my foot was huge for no reason. I have not had any injuries; insect bites or infections. The first doctor I went to took x-rays which came back normal and ran a CBC which also came back completely normal. He told me I would just have to live with the swelling and wrote a Rx for Lasik PRN to help. The Lasik does help when I take it but as soon as I stop taking it the swelling comes right back. I've been told not to take it long term as it can effect important vitamin levels. I wasn't ready to just treat the symptoms and live with it so I went to an Internist who took me off birth control pills thinking it could be hormones but the swelling continued. She then sent me for a venous doppler test which also came back normal. She is sending me for an untrasound of the heart tomorrow. If the heart tests come back normal what else could be causing this unexplained swelling? It is only in the left foot/ankle and pitts for about 30 seconds when pushed on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with a diasnosis? I am afraid that I'm at the end of the road with tests and the doctors can't seem to figure out what is causing this swelling in a young; healthy person.

159,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat? I am wating to see an electrophysiologist for an EP study to see what is going on. My hope is that this can be corrected quickly. I am taking metroporal and asprin daily.

The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23).

161,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying ""well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous"" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this.

162,Amlodipine+hypertension,For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches. My own doctor has; thus-far; not taken it very seriously and tends to take the line that; after years of 'getting away with it; maybe you've finally developed an allergy!',2007,2008,61.0,Male,for around three four year i suffer headach two hour consumpt amount alcohol although typic two drink upward kind alcohol the headach come slowli persist follow line left side neck across top head left eyebrow they sharp pain constant throb go hour pain relief medic noth relief i get applic someth topic like 4head american headon although i reason activ drinker past anyth age 61 male i rare two drink time im surpris onset headach my doctor thusfar taken serious tend take line year get away mayb youv final develop allergi

164,Amlodipine+hypertension,"There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the ""spot"" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?",2008,2008,,Male,there sever us similar eye complaint see bright flash like afterimag flash bulb blink sometim upgaz this transient symptom us last anywher day week when spot visual field pass dark background spot appear light when spot pass light background appear dark so far doctor havent abl diagnos us perhap mean simpli idiopath phenomenon but case im wonder similar might could bring us closer explan for instanc factor might clue i take 100 mg zoloft day i would describ highanxieti stress i clench teeth usual side effect eye i alot sinus problem around eye i doubl vision due weak muscl one eye i mani floater one promin one eye without bright spot how
165,Amlodipine+hypertension,Not sure where to post this. A few days ago I had a sensation of the floor vibrating under one foot. Since then I have realized it is my foot. It is felt in bloth feet; one at a time. Never both at the same time. I feel it when I am standing r walking. It is like an intermittent buzzing sensation. It comes in short bursts on after the other then stops. It will happen when walking and I will feel it with every third or fourth step. What could be the cause? I am taking no medications; only slightly over weight and am a 47 yr. old female in good health.

166,Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past 4 years I have been experiencing horrible symptoms. It seemed that the whole thing started as a sinus infection but then I went for a CT scan of sinuses and they were clear. I have been having symptoms of dizziness; head pain; shakiness and a spaced out kind of foggy feeling like i am watching my life from the outside - all day every day. There are some times for a couple of hours during the day that the symptoms may lift and give me a few moments to live- but not much. I have been to about 30 doctors- including ENT's allergists; neurologists; chiropracters; opthamologists. psychologists; dentists and everything else u can think of. All CT scans; MRI of brain and blood work keep coming back clean and ok. Nothing I try seems to work. There was a period of time about 3 and a half years ago that the symptoms lifted for about 4 months and then it returned full force. Some of the weird parts are that the shakiness seems to be seasonal - coming in spring and lasting thru summer and its miserable like a tingling pins and needles sensation thru out my body. I have also been getting what some doctors seem to diagnose as recurring sinus infections- like 10 a year- i take anti biotics and i feel slightly better until the next infection but i still have the other symtoms while I am on the medication. I have hay fever and allergies to mold dust...Every doctor tried diagnosing something different- like migraines or TMJ or some sort of other odd thing. I've tried tons of medications. I dont usually have all the symptoms at once...they kind of take turns. One doctor suggested moving to Arizona as it may be a sinus issue but the ENT's say I have no sinus isue- just regular allergies and the allergists say that they have never seen symptoms like these for allergies. I tried psychologists even though the ony reason I am stressed out is cuz I can never live....before this sickness I was the happiest person around- and even psychologists turned me away as normal. Is there anyone out there that may know something that can help me - please??......I can not go on like this anymore,2007,2007,,,for past 4 year i experienc horribl symptom it seem whole thing start sinus infect i went ct scan sinus clear i symptom dizzi head pain shaki space kind foggi feel like watch life outsid day everi day there time coupl hour day symptom may lift give moment live much i 30 doctor includ ent allergist neurologist chiropract opthamologist psychologist dentist everyth els u think all ct scan mri brain blood work keep come back clean ok noth i tri seem work there period time 3 half year ago symptom lift 4 month return full forc some weird part shaki seem season come spring last thru summer miser like tingl pin needl sensat thru bodi i also get doctor seem diagnos recur sinus infect like 10 year take anti biotic feel slight better next infect still symtom i medic i hay fever allergi mold dusteveri doctor tri diagnos someth differ like migrain tmj sort odd thing ive tri ton medic i dont usual symptom oncethey kind take turn one doctor suggest move arizona may sinus issu ent say i sinus isu regular allergi allergist say never seen symptom like allergi i tri psychologist even though oni reason i stress cuz i never livebefor sick i happiest person around even psychologist turn away normal is anyon may know someth help pleasei go like anymor

Pedialyte ice is also better. She throws up until she staggers and falls-I am continuously trying to hydrate her and giving her baby food-At times; she is able to keep it down; other times the vomiting is horrible. She continues to try for us; and we are fighting so hard for her-LIke others; I tuck her in at night (she sleeps on the loveseat with her ""bankie"" covering her). I am sleeping in the den with her so I can give her support throughout the night. Neither of us are getting much sleep. I have her spoiled now with hand feeding other than her baby food; and I hold her plate while she licks it up. I am using a recipe of egg yellow / whites; honey; and whole yogurt with a touch of dry powdered milk. This works sometimes. Sandy Grace is not ready to leave us-she continues to try-we try for her twenty-four hours a day. Is there any over the counter medication that I can give her that will help with her vomiting?

169,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 73 year old male that has elevated BP in the pulmonary artery. Started out in early 2011 with a heart murmur; echo measured pressure was 38.4; repeat echo in about 6 months; pressure was 39. Recent echo last 2 weeks (2/6/13) was 40. I have no outward signs such as dizziness; SOB; fatigue. My peripheral BP runs about 125-135/55-70. My question is; I know the numbers are abnormal but how abnormal? Is a rise of 1.6mm of Hg in 2 years significant? How high of a number is considered severe. I have just been put on diltiazem CD 120 daily with a repeat echo in 6 months. Should I just wait and see what happens or should I be considering a more aggressive approach? I've read all the data on life expectancy and it's not good.

170,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male,i male 70 year age i 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 this control bp within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 my doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 my concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead i tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret
171,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear.

175,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real ""symptoms"" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the ""silent killer"". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its ""gentle"". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now.

177,Diltiazem+hypertension,In the last two weeks I have had four episodes of AFIB. The first in two years landed me in the Hospital. My meds were changed from Metoprolol to Diltiazem 360 mg per day and Fleconade 50 mg 2x per day plus Warfarin. The Metoprolol 25mcg 1 x daily has been making me wheeze for the past four years; but no one ever thought to change the meds. I have been on this new med protocol for 1.5 weeks. I just started the Fleconide and Warfarin three days ago. My question is I need to loose 45 pounds asap. I am doing very well eating 1000 Kcal per day with a small abount or carbs (under 25) and otherwise lots of green vegetables and fish (Salmon only once a week) ; then some extra lean turkey. Really feel great with the diet. But I started moderate exercise as soon as I was released from the Hospital. I walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.5mph then I do various lite weight lifting (Nautilus rocker equipment) I have lost 10 lbs since my Hospital visit. But i have also had three episodes of AFIB while the Diltiazem was being increased. EchoCardiogram and Chemical Stress test shows zero blockages or other heart problems. I have the approval of the Cardiologist to go back to the gym and moderately exercise. I have quickly become addicted to the exercise and the diet. I am afraid of the Fleconide; afraid of the AFIB and BP 130/86 avg. Pulse is down to 60 ( was 80 - 110) resting. So I am afraid of exercise. I just need advice.

183,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 46 year old female. I recently had an ECHO done because of palpitations. Results show stage I diastolic dysfunction; mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy; mild mitral regurgitation; possible bicuspid valve - difficult to differentiate due to calcification; moderate aortic valve regurgitation; minimal tricuspid regurgitation; aortic valve sclerosis. I also had a Cardiolite stress test done; which showed no blockages. My cholesterol level is 237 (HDL 60; LDL 155). Has anyone else experienced similar problems? If so; what should I expect? I have a strong family history of heart problems. I am working on lowering my cholesterol and losing some weight. Is there anything else I could be doing to slow the progression of my condition?

184,Diltiazem+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate.

I've been taking diltiazem for about a year now and it's always kept my blood pressure around 120/85. I've also had anxiety along with this but recently my doc suggested that I try prozac to help my anxiety and although skeptical; I finally agreed to give it a try.

186,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report. Third echo since Nov 04; this at PHClinic; normal left 'side' at rest incl RV size and function. Est. RV S.Pressure; 32 mmHg (BP 158/90) inc. to 60 mmHg (BP 184/82)at peak exercise(supine bike). Ejection fraction response to stress from 65% at rest to 75% peak stress. LV end-systolic volume decr. with stress. There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'. Two weeks following my visit; new PHP prescribed Lisinopril 2.5mg AM; diltiazem 120mg PM. I track my blood pressure as advised; in the range of 145/80 pulse 75. I weigh 134lbs; 5'5""; don't smoke/drink; am 60. Exercise around the house and use stat. bike. Sometimes my BP reaches 180/95 for no reason. Worry so about all this.

187,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and am taking Cartia XT 240mg for pulmonary hypertension; aspirin and Lovenox due to antiphospholipid antibodes; prilosec; and 30mg of Cortef daily for adrenal insufficiency; which is slightly higher than replacement dose to simultaneously treat my autoimmune disease. Also; prior to the pregnancy I was taking 200mg of plaquenil twice daily; as well as 1200mg of Ibuprofen; for undifferentiated connective tissue disease. I will likely have to restart plaquenil and ibuprofen after the pregnancy if my autoimmune disease flares; which is likely. I was wondering about taking this combination of medications while breastfeeding. The Lovenox will be dropped; but all of the others will continue. There seems to be conflicting data about the safely of taking calcium channel blockers while breastfeeding; in particular. Many sites warn against taking Cartia XT sustained release capsules while breastfeeding; based on the results of certain studies that show a substantial amount passes through to the breastmilk; yet some experts seem to think it's okay. What would you recommend to a patient like me. I really don't want to continue to continue to expose the baby to multiple medications; especially the diltiazem; if not necessary.

188,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests. I wish I could have a monitor which could be activated to record an ECG when I have pain.,2007,2007,60.0,Female,im 61yearold femal treatment hypertens high cholesterol 152 lb strong famili histori ischaem heart diseas chest pain last summer autumn bp 200110 180106 respect went away bp control i heart murmur never abl identifi echocardiogram reveal slight left ventricular hypertrophi in april thallium scan negat i indigest problem pain total differ natur locat howev last two week ive get chest pain central strong pressur radiat neckjaw quit strong precipit exercis intens concentr usual goe 5 minut reliev gtn on wednesday i sever episod ever trigger hurri bus it last 20 minut neck pain longer take 3 dose gtn settl that realli scari ive certain never experienc anyth like although i cant defin just occasion miniepisod i climb stair fast feel total shatter medic lisinopril 10mg diltiazem xl 120mg aspirin 75mg gtn spray trazodon 150mg depress fluanxol 1mg i eat healthi diet lose weight recent start gym my gp say ok if i sensibl on tuesday i realli overdid thing wednesday scare plus fact i feel shatter im break am i neurot think scan fals negat i ischaem heart diseas could indigest radiat neck reliev gtn could nonischaem cardiac caus my gp go refer angiogram doesnt settl diltiazem she feel could well cardiac spite test i wish i could monitor could activ record ecg i pain

190,Diltiazem+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65.0,Female,both parent number close relat vari degre hypertens i start chest pain 2006 bp found 168110 it respond quit well treatment i sent investig i echocardiogram show definit although slight left ventricular hypertrophi felt i must hypertens time i exercis ecg radionuclid scan the result show slight narrow lad consid insignific pain disappear my bp remain 13084 14595 i lisinopril increas 20mg diltiazem 120mg in 2011 i diagnos type 2 diabet i eat healthi diet although overweight lose wellcontrol metformin howev famili histori mean bp consist 13080 june 2012 i start propranolol 40mg twice daili a month ago i start develop similar central chest pain similar 2006 although radiat wors exert sometim present rest my gp would like investig the last two day ive resum home bp monitor seem consist 166100 tonight pain sever enough requir gtn rare this reliev instant would point angina i took even medic befor gtn bp 170108 higher five year although i consist medic now still 16393 i think i need medic increas longterm

193,Diltiazem+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement.

195,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello; Thank you;I really appreciate you taking my question. The cardiologist I currently see was unable to see me after the cath so had to be seen by the nurse practioner.I was told need to stay on current meds clonidine;diltiazem;traim/hctz;diovan metoprolol;minoxidil) The first cardio seen said that we were running out of options.I have tried every class of medication I'm max'd out on beta blockers;do to asthma;max'd on ARB's and Calcium channel blockers.I take a diuretic;told increasing that would probably help very little.I could not tolerate Ace inibitors and Central acting blockers;(Tenex and Catpres patch because of allergies)the clonidine tablets;I'm taking now have been causing me problems;but because I was told my option were running out; i continue to take them.I was told could take Hydralazine;or Aldomet;but both require taking 3-4 times daily.was told could go up on the minoxidil.i refused did not like the side effects. I've been checked for secondary causes;except Pheochromocytoma; told rare and not likley;should this be ruled out? I recently had surgery and had problems with blood pressure dropping to low(80/30)and breathing problems;shortness of breath when walking oxygen sat would drop to low;could this be from all the meds? I take numerous medication for asthma; could this be contributing to the increase in blood pressure;if so what can be done? Does Procardia work well for vasospasms.

I started having severe chest pain about a year ago and underwent a cardiac stress test; cardiac cath; in which the cardiologist feels that I have a nutcracker esophogus along with some leaking valves; hypertension. The stress showed some ischemia and hence the cardiac cath but that was normal. He prescribed nitro for the chest pain along with taking toprol xl; lotrel to control the htn; and he couldn't rule out coronary spasms all together but with my history of esophogitis; gerds;ulcers etc.. he feels that this is the best treatment. I also see a internist who recently did a EGD and found that I did not have Barrett's esophogus but some scarring and inflammation. I go through this every few months with the spasms; the intense reflux; abdominal pain etc.. I wind up off work for several days because I can't get it under control. How do I do this?

199,Diltiazem+hypertension,My question is what does 'lung bases not well visualized' mean? In 2004 I was diagnosed with exercise-induced PH by a specialist in the field; and this was put down as being due to my high blood pressure being uncontrolled. My PAP at the time was 78. The next year I had another opinion with another very well-respected PH specialist; and he told me that he did not agree with the first diagnosis. I now see a cardiologist in the small town where I live; and my PAP at the latest echo was 31. I am 63; my medication is diltiazem; lisinopril; maxide and an aspirin. I don't and have never smoked. I exercise. But; I still have breathing problems and wonder if this is due to some of the medication; or whether there is some problem with my lungs. Thank you.

When talking to him over the phone he mentioned that I had really high cardiac output and highly oxygenated blood in the lungs (meaning it shouldn't be that oxygenated yet). It's a couple weeks till I see him. Any thoughts on what could be going on? I've had these symptoms for several months now; am on Diltiazem and a Nitro patch but they seem to not be as effective as they initially were. My main complaint is the shortness of breath.

202,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I have a question about ongoing irregular menstrual cycles and pain. For the last 5 or 6 months I've had very irregular cycles. Heavy bleeding with large clots where I'm flooding through into my clothes after 2hrs. This does not happen every period but with the majority of them. I also have recently had spotting several days of the month about a week after my ""normal"" period. I am in my 20's; not currently sexually active. I've had a recent pelvic exam; pap smear etc. They did not note any cysts on the ovaries during the exam but did say that they could not feel the uterus very well as it is ? retroverted? I'm currently waiting for an ultrasound for further diagnosis. I have three questions in relation to this? 1. What are the most likely causes of bleeding such as this? 2. Could medication which I take for hypertension and SVT/NSVT (propafenone; diltiazem and triazide) have any effect on menstrual cycles? 3. If this is a primarily hormonal problem is hypertension an absolute contraindication to taking oral contraceptives. Does it really increase the risk for adverse effects in an otherwise healthy; non-smoking young female?

204,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello again; I was evaluated for renal artery stenosis; it was ok. I'm hypothyroid; on thyroid medication since 92; lab work done and thyroid levels are fine. I don't drink; smoke; or do any kind of illegal drugs. All symptoms listed on previous post were conveyed to the cardiologist I'm seeing. Was on Prednisone off and on; while being weened off Labetalol.I had highblood pressure readings before starting any asthma medication. With all the prescibed medication I'm recieving. I'm afraid to take anything else. I was told I have essential Hypertension. With the information listed above; what else could be done? The beta blockers seem to work best on keeping the blood pressure down. However I'm told people with asthma should not take them. Q.How exactly do beta blockers cause problems for asthmatics? What is a similiar drug; that could be used in it's place? I feel like my concerns are not being addressed. Maybe I'm not asking enough questions or the right questions. Q. Any suggestions on question I might ask or how to approach him with my concerns. Could you please tell me how the following drugs work on reducing blood pressure?

206,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to ""white coat syndrome""; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9"" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event"" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour. My cholesterol was 225; trigylycerides in normal range; with LDL of 159 & HDL of 49. I do not have a family history of any heart disease. I do not smoke & never have. I have one glass of red wine a day. Because my husband developed high BP & then A-fib; we have been eating a low fat; high fiber diet for over a year. I had rheumatic fever as a child; but doctors have not heard a heart murmur for years. Up until now I have been very healthy all of my adult life. I have a B.S. in medical technology. As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP. We have good insurance so can having any testing that is required; but I would prefer not to get into anything invasive until we have exhausted the non-invasive options.",2008,2008,,Female,i 53 yr femal start experienc continu puls rate 100 after famili doctor wrote white coat syndrom i switch internist she 1st place atenolol 50 mg i could toler even reduc 25 mg i could sleep asthmat problem raynoud syndrom my bp usual either normal prehypertens rang last two year i 59 185 lbs i exercis walk dog 2 mile day weight lift least week i diltiazem 240 mg the internist increas 120 mg i spike 14090 bp it appear higher dosag control bp morn 11069 necessarili puls rate 99 yesterday afternoon i 30 day cardiac monitor start 12308 i one event puls 120 went back high 90s hour my cholesterol 225 trigylycerid normal rang ldl 159 hdl 49 i famili histori heart diseas i smoke never i one glass red wine day becaus husband develop high bp afib eat low fat high fiber diet year i rheumat fever child doctor heard heart murmur year up i healthi adult life i bs medic technolog as scientist i satisfi take medicin i realli want understand whi my internist say diltiazem control tachycardia end week refer cardiologist she said doesnt mani drug work high puls rate someon high bp we good insur test requir i would prefer get anyth invas exhaust noninvas option
207,Diltiazem+hypertension,Since the beginning of January I; have been intermittently tachycardic (HR 95-120; generally 2-3 times a day); hypertensive (running anywhere from 170/110-220/140); nauseated; flushing (dry flushing; lasting anywhere from several minutes to 24 hours; present on face; neck; chest; and arms); and intermittent low grade temperatures (99.0-100.5). Initially was thought to have influenza; but no swab done. Then ?bacterial infection; course of antibiotics with no improvement. Continuing symptoms with no change. Visited ER multiple times and received IV fluids; which did not improve tachycardia or hypertension as it generally does with dehydration. Sepsis workup was negative; CT scan chest negative as well as chest x-ray. CT abdomen/pelvis did reveal a focal lesion on the liver; and small nonspecific inguinal lymph nodes. Follow-up MRI finding was focal fat left hepatic lobe. Normal appearing adrenal glands and pancreas. Prior to January I never had any history of hypertension or flushing. Flashback to Feb 2010... I had a mediastinal mass resection that pathology came back as benign thymic tissue. Had experienced tachycardia 4 months prior to resection and was hospitalized; sinus tachycardia 130's and ended up on diltiazem drip (avoided beta blockers due to asthma history). No mass on CT at that time! Had not experienced any further tachycardia since that then. July 2010 left thyroid nodule discovered on US and FNA completed...indeterminate; too few cells. This was followed by 2 ultrasounds 6 months apart with no change. It was decided at that point that no further follow-up was needed. This was at Mayo… Back to present...Echocardiogram completed the end of January was normal. We did end up starting diltiazem CD 180 mg with absolutely no improvement in tachycardia or hypertension. Spironolactone initiated 50 mg twice daily; minimal improvement. Performed 24 hour urine for metanephrine/catecholamine...negative; I don't have the specific values from this. Also performed 5-HIAA at that time; which was negative. Phone consult with endocrinology by my primary MD came up with ?carcinoid. Chromagranin-A was negative as well as tryptase. Dexamethasone suppression test completed 3 times; slightly elevated (2.4; should be =0); Prolactin 1.3 (5.2-26.5); Calcitonin <5.0 (<8). May 2; I had surgery. When I woke up in recovery it was like someone flipped a switch. No nausea and no flushing at all!!!! Blood pressures and heart rate still elevated. Also had horrendous pain at the incision site that we could not get controlled. Once we got home; I continued to have really bad pain for a couple weeks (cheeks would flush with pain only; and stop once improved). Blood pressures and heart rate began venturing back down to 140/80-160/100 (not good; but definitely a major improvement from prior to surgery). Continued to not have any nausea or flushing. Pathology came back as benign adenoma. I continued to be the one in a million patient and ended up with an infection in my incision; an allergic reaction to mederma; and a myositis in the muscles on the RIGHT side of my neck…but still no flushing; nausea; tachycardia; etc. My body had every reason to have those symptoms; but didn’t! 3 weeks later all of my symptoms came back with a vengeance..blood pressures; heart rate; flushing; nausea; palpitations…EVERYTHING!! At that point; meds were the same dosages. Blood pressures much more resistant to medications this time. Have had to titrate meds up a lot. Diltiazem stopped; labetolol started (200 mg twice daily). Had to decrease it due to near syncopal episodes; but interestingly enough; I never had a low blood pressure even with spells. Currently on Labetolol 100 mg twice daily; Clonidine 0.2 mg three times daily; Spironolactone 25 mg twice daily; and Lasix 20 mg daily. Even with this regimen am very routinely running blood pressures 170/100-210/130! Heart rates finally 80-95. Other symptoms basically the same. TSH was 1.65 in Jan; 0.8 in June; and 1.77 last week (reference range 0.36-3.74); FT4 0.79 (0.76-1.46) and T3 130 (80-200) last week. So; here is where things sit as of today. My gut feeling is that this is thyroid; even though labs are normal and have been the entire time. It seems really strange that after surgery; for a full 3 weeks; all symptoms were improved. Then; at the 3-4 week mark when you can start to figure out if the remaining thyroid will take over full function; symptoms came back. We already know that there are cysts on the remaining right lobe. It is also interesting that I was nauseated and had no appetite prior to surgery and gradually lost some weight over 5 months. In the immediate 1 month post-op period; I lost 15 pounds without trying; and eating high calorie; high protein; small meals. I asked the surgeon if we should have removed the entire thyroid. He can see where I'm coming from and can see the reasoning behind it. He told me he can see a huge difference from before surgery; to after; and to now! Also is willing to take the other half out; but endocrinology is adamant that this will not help flushing and hypertension issues. They also can't explain why symptoms went away or why they came back…or what they were from in the first place. Next Wednesday I have a consult with the surgeon that trained my surgeon. If he has seen anything like this or can see my rationale; he will give the go ahead for surgery. I'm at my wits end and just want to feel better and have my life back. I feel like my surgeon is the only one pulling for me aside from my primary doc. My gut is that this has to be done to prove one way or another. I have sat down with my main endocrinologist and had a consult with another. In very clear terms I explained what I think is going on. I told them that they have to take a step back from their numbers and doctor hat. They have to be able to look at things from the patient perspective. Ultimately this is my body and that counts for something. I'm the one living this miserable; scary reality. The really frustrating thing is that my primary doc; who is wonderful; doesn't even know what to do for meds for BP anymore. He asks what endocrinology think; who in return; don't really seem to be concerned with the situation or finding a fix. I'm stuck in the middle and just want to feel better. I do have a cardiology consult in August; but truly think that if we take the other half of the thyroid out that we won't need it. Does my thinking make sense to anyone else? Any feedback would be truly appreciated!

210,Diltiazem+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times.

I have been feeling signifigantly worse to the point that I haven't worked in a month. My cardiologist has tried covera hs 180; and 240 which didn't work and I am now on dilitziam 180 mg which has also not worked. I am in agony yet my cardiologist acts like I should learn to deal wit it. He doesn't seem to understand my symptoms are severe. Don't you think that he ought to be doing other tests??? I really need some relief from my symptoms!!!,2002,2002,,,i 30 year old restaur owner start problem 3 month ago i start get dizzi short breat work my hear would also race i would feel like im pass my doctor reffer echo done it show moder mitral valv aortic valv regurgit i feel signifig wors point i havent work month my cardiologist tri covera hs 180 240 didnt work i dilitziam 180 mg also work i agoni yet cardiologist act like i learn deal wit he doesnt seem understand symptom sever dont think ought test i realli need relief symptom
213,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down on the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit. The only time I feel okay is when my sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated- exercise; emotion; etc. but when that wears off; I get unable to drive or walk around as my brain does not seem to get enough oxygen with the low heart rate from pvcs.

214,Diltiazem+hypertension,I recently experienced an outbreak of (genital); herpes the third in about two months. I went to the doctor with the first outbreak and the MD said that it was an abcess. As I was told over 25 years ago that I had herpes; I did not take this any further; though the MD suggesting opening the abcess. This was my first visit to an MD in all these years. However; with this last episode; it seems that the herpes had spread inside my anus and was terribly painful; this along with general malaise; pain in my left groin and fever. It has taken about two weeks to recover. My question. I would like to know if there is believed to be any relationship between this form of herpes and pulmonary hypertension?,2005,2005,,,i recent experienc outbreak genit herp third two month i went doctor first outbreak md said abcess as i told 25 year ago i herp i take though md suggest open abcess this first visit md year howev last episod seem herp spread insid anus terribl pain along general malais pain left groin fever it taken two week recov my question i would like know believ relationship form herp pulmonari hypertens
215,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all?

216,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion.

218,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello everyone. Just happened to come across this site when searching for more information on PVCs and Mitral Valve Prolapse. Wanted to share my story as well. Thursday night after Thanksgiving dinner; I started noticed PVCs about every couple of minutes or so. I didn't think much of it since I'd just ate a big dinner and thought it might be indigestion. Then Friday rolls around; and still feeling the PVCs every few minutes. Saturday night I decided to visit the ER since I've never had this happen before. Usually I feel them a few times a day at most. The doctor ran some tests; did a chest xray; and hooked me up to an EKG. After about 8 hours; they said the xrays and heart enzyme tests looked fine and no stress seemed present for my heart. The PVCs were very clear on the EKG to them; so they recommended that I contact my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist for follow up. Naturally; I was freaked out completely; but I do take some comfort in reading the posts on this site and seeing that there are others like me that share similar symptoms of PVCs lasting all day (and far beyond). Since this is a new journey for me; are there any questions I should have ready for the cardiologist? Any tests I should ask for?

219,Diltiazem+hypertension,Had a ablation for wpw 10 days ago. EP said it is completely gone (normal EKG) few days after I had double heart rate that lasted about 2 min. Then went back to normal. Im tired and get out of breath sometimes.. Heart rate also goes up when walking goes back in the 70-80s resting. Im 62 and do take meds for high bloodpressure. Dr. Changed my blood pressure med. to cartia xt after I had a bad svt attack that put me in the hospital hoping that the meds would calm my heart down (on this med. I was feeling tired and out of breath at times . ) one this meds. I had another attack-dr. Sent me to see a EP he found the problem right away. There was a cancelation and the following week went in for the ablation. Like i said above everything went fine. Not due to go for follow up in a month; ive talked to his head nurse and she said that it was normal for the heart to act up after ablation; that it just takes time. But I was wondering if maybe the meds that im on is the reason that im tired and out of breath since that was going on before the ablation.? Im just not feeling great. Has anyone else felt this way.

220,Diltiazem+hypertension,"35 yo M; previously in good health. Cholesterol OK (170s) and bp 120s/70s. My father and his mother developed high bp in late 50s. No other history of heart trouble. I've recently developed heart rhythm probs. For last 2 months; I've had episodes when my HR races upon mild exertion. 1st visit to cardiologist occurred the same day as I was having symptoms. The EKG in office was normal. But a stress test showed HR quickly at 200. The doctor diagnosed SVT/atrial flutter and put me on 50mg Troprol and 325mg aspirin. I've had progressively longer episodes during which HR might race. During these; my resting HR is 90s and upon mild exertion HR rises to 180s. Sitting down or just standing still causes the HR to fall back to resting rate. High HR lasts only for a short time. The alternative “mode” for heart is normal. The resting HR is 65-75. During extended moderate exertion; HR rises to 110s. Further visits to the cardiologist occurred during this mode and my EKGs were normal. I had catheter ablation last week. Doctor found three irregular rhythms:1 main & 2 extra. The rhythms switched irregularly between the three. The two extra rhythms were short-lived and came from the left atrium. Despite this; main rhythm was treated but other 2 were not (too short lived). Two days after procedure; heart switched over to the ""fast"" mode and it has been there since then. Doc wants to wait and see what happens. While this is somewhat unsatisfactory; I understand the need to get a better handle on how often my symptoms occur; their nature; whether medication might help. 1)Is the Toprol worthwhile? I don't feel it is making much difference. 2)My doctor described my condition as unusual for someone of my age. How unusual? 3)What are the major risks? Doc described my condition as not life-threatening and my biggest risk being an increased chance of stroke; but still very low. I'm a little paranoid about the risk of stroke now. 4)Is a second attempt at ablation worthwhile?",2007,2007,,Male,35 yo m previous good health cholesterol ok 170s bp 120s70s my father mother develop high bp late 50s no histori heart troubl ive recent develop heart rhythm prob for last 2 month ive episod hr race upon mild exert 1st visit cardiologist occur day i symptom the ekg offic normal but stress test show hr quick 200 the doctor diagnos svtatrial flutter put 50mg troprol 325mg aspirin ive progress longer episod hr might race dure rest hr 90s upon mild exert hr rise 180s sit stand still caus hr fall back rest rate high hr last short time the altern mode heart normal the rest hr 6575 dure extend moder exert hr rise 110s further visit cardiologist occur mode ekg normal i cathet ablat last week doctor found three irregular rhythms1 main 2 extra the rhythm switch irregular three the two extra rhythm shortliv came left atrium despit main rhythm treat 2 short live two day procedur heart switch fast mode sinc doc want wait see happen while somewhat unsatisfactori i understand need get better handl often symptom occur natur whether medic might help 1is toprol worthwhil i dont feel make much differ 2mi doctor describ condit unusu someon age how unusu 3what major risk doc describ condit lifethreaten biggest risk increas chanc stroke still low im littl paranoid risk stroke 4is second attempt ablat worthwhil
221,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

224,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I had a heart attack in the beginning of October of this year (confirmed by elevated cardiac enzymes) and in the angiogram (sp) they did not find a blockage but were able to see where the damage was and said that one of my small arteries ""clamped down"" but had re-opened. They diagnosed me with unstable angina. I already have severe labile blood pressure (it will vary between 95/45 and 235/140; and can drop or raise by 40+ points in minutes and has happened under general anesthesia leading to severe complications when treated); mild LVH; sinus tach; v-tach (EKG confirmed) and severe exercise intolerance (just getting dressed or trying to brush my hair can trigger it; with tach and SOB) and ""improper"" positional hypertension (will soar when I stand still; stand up and plummet when I lay down). I am using my nitro way too often (in my opinion) and do not even use it for every chest pain I get; only when the pain is unrelenting. (at least 5 a week; usually more). I also have other conditions that are caused by vagus nerve issues (Gastroparesis) and am thinking that this is also autonomic in nature and possibly Mitochondrial.

225,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 53 yo man diagnosed ~8 years ago with lone paroxysmal atrial flutter and afib. Long term history of endurance sports but nothing outrageous - running 20 miles a week since my teens. Episodes are generally less than an hour; but frequent - typically one every day or couple of days. Have been trying a ""pill in a pocket"" appproach - that is; I will take some metoprolol (50 mg tablet) if the tachycardia lasts more than 5 minutes. Usually the episode will end 10-20 minutes after taking the medication. I have taken a Ca channel blocker (diltiazem) in the past; but that did not seem effective. So here's the question. The beta and calcium channel blockers as you of course know are referred to as ""rate control"" medications; yet they don't do a thing to my heart rate while I am in afib or flutter (though the beta blocker does reduce my resting heart rate when not in tachycardia; the Ca blocker not so much.) But the beta blocker does seem to reduce the length of the episodes compared to how long they last if I just let it go; so this seems to be some sort of rhythm control. (And again; the Ca blocker does not seem to be effective at this either; which is why it is a former medication.) Is my experience with these medications common in your experience - that is; some rhythm control but little effective rate control? Is there something about the metoprolol specifically that separates it from the other beta blockers? (""membrane stabilizing effect?"")

226,Diltiazem+hypertension,HI; i'm a 20 year old female in college. I have recently (in the past year) been treated for SVT by having a cardiac ablation. However; my heart rhythm issues have continued. I have hypertension and general anxiety. I think the anxiety is more so linked to not knowing whats wrong with my heart. My heart rate is out of control. Resting it can go from 70-120. When I simply walk to class it will be about 140. My doctor has put me on 240 mg of diltiazem; which has solved neither my heart rate issue or blood pressure (still high). My EP told me that I have inappropriate sinus tacky cardia; and that I may just have it for the remainder of my life. My current worry is that when i'm at the gym my heart rate is generally around 175; but will rise to about 200. I get short of breath; so I stop. My doctor assures me that this is okay; but if I'm on medication to control the heart rate and its still that high; I don't understand how thats normal. I also sometimes feel palpations; but I had a heart monitor test and it didn't show any major abnormalities (I couldn't wear it when at the gym). I don't know what to do at this point. I'm at such a loss and feeling so out of control with my body. If anyone has any diagnosis suggestions I would sincerely appreciate it; or just to share your story.

227,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 56 years old with a family history of heart disease; hypertension and diabetes. I have had high blood pressure; semi controlled; for 10 years. I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond.

228,Diltiazem+hypertension,I talked with Gail a little while ago and she sounds good. She got out of the hospital last Wed. and for some unfathomable reason they still don't know what is wrong with her. She is on oxygen so she is kind of under house arrest until they figure it out. She had been waiting to get in to see this heart Dr where she lives; but he has not seemed in any big hurry so she has made an appt with either a heart specialist or heart clinic in Paducah for next Thurs. The Dr that referred her to the local heart guy told Gail that this heart guy thought of himself as semi retired and I am thinking he is semi retarded. She tried like crazy to get in touch with him and he still hasn't returned her calls. She has cancer for God's sake you don't put people off like that. I think her Dr said that the heart guy was reluctant to do surgeries because of this semi retirement and I didn't catch if that was pertaining to Gail or in general. I was on a cell phone and she is sucking oxygen so it was hard to hear and I didn't want to keep asking you to repeat yourself because you were starting to sound winded. Sorry; I won't talk about you like you are not here. Anyhow; they still think it is Pulmonary Hypertension and it can be treated with; of all things; Viagra. They think it is this PH thing because she is just fine on the oxygen (well; as fine as you can be hooked up to a tank) but 5 minutes without it and she is gasping for air. The Viagra makes sense; since it increases blood flow; but in her case it will be to the lungs. This is from the American Heart Association: The blood vessels that supply the lungs constrict and their walls thicken; so they can't carry as much blood. As in a kinked garden hose; pressure builds up and backs up. The heart works harder; trying to force the blood through. If the pressure is high enough; eventually the heart can't keep up; and less blood can circulate through the lungs to pick up oxygen. Patients then become tired; dizzy and short of breath. Here is the link if you would like to learn more. http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11076 She said she has been sleeping alot; but that is probably for the best anyway. Oh; another friend of hers on here called her Dr @ MD Anderson and told him what was going on (good for you; what a good friend) and her Dr got in touch with her local guy and they are changing her chemo; but I am sorry; I didn't hear what it was; but she won't have to go back on chemo until after her next trip to MD Anderson June 25th & 26th. That's all I know and I am sorry I couldn't hear better. We love you Gail and you just rest and get all better. Don't put up with anymore cr@p from those Drs up there.

229,Diltiazem+hypertension,My blood pressure has two different readings when taken from both arms simultaneously. The difference sometime can defer as much as 10 mmH. For example; from my right arm it reads 140/86; but my left arm reads 150/94 and it has been quite consistantly different between 5-10 mmH. Another question is; I am currently taking COSAAR 50mg to control my Blood pressure and after a couple of months; it seems that the medication has no effect on me. I was wondering whether the 100mg COSAAR is actually twice the 50mg dosage coz I am currently taking 1/2 tablet of 100mg instead of the 50mg tablet; due the cost different.,2009,2009,,Male,my blood pressur two differ read taken arm simultan the differ sometim defer much 10 mmh for exampl right arm read 14086 left arm read 15094 quit consist differ 510 mmh anoth question i current take cosaar 50mg control blood pressur coupl month seem medic effect i wonder whether 100mg cosaar actual twice 50mg dosag coz i current take 12 tablet 100mg instead 50mg tablet due cost differ

231,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 28 years old and otherwise a healthy individual. Last April I woke up one day with what I believe to have been atrial fibrillation; but by the time the EMT's arrived; I had converted. The doctor's at the hospital told me not to sweat it. I then had about two more episodes of atrial fibrillation after binge drinking the night before; but converted on my own. I did not think there was much of a problem until about a month and a half ago when I started to get PVC's every night. Then about a week after they began; I woke up with my heart wildly out of control. The EMT's came and hooked me up on a 12 lead and determined that I had a heart rate of about 280 bpm and that I was in atrial fibrillation along with Vtach and PVC's. I went to the hospital and stayed about 4 days. They thought maybe WPW; but my echo and stress test were negative for the delta wave or any other problems. I had an EP study performed; whereby my elecrophysiologist concluded atrial fibrillation. However; I think this conclusion was based on the notion that they were unable to reproduce my arrhythmia; so AFib was the default answer. I have been doing extensive research and thought my arrhythmias were related to GERD because I had noticed my PVC's were worse after acid reflux. It got to the point that every time I would lay down; I would have constant PVC's. On Thanksgiving I had bad heartburn; one alcoholic beverage; and atrial fibrillation the next morning. I had gone on a GERD friendly diet waiting to see the physician; and I magically felt a lot better. However; a few days later I started having PVC's at night again; but this time it was not when I laid down; but rather after I had slept for awhile. I had a barium swallow; which came back negative for GERD; but positive for duodenitis. Feeling lost as to my problem; I came across information about vagally mediated atrial fibrillation; which seemed to make the most sense. I believe my duodenitis to be caused by an over-secretion of stomach acid due to the vagus nerve; which is why the test was negative as to GERD. I am also male; young; otherwise healthy heart; former military and athlete. I now have PVC's; which occur after about every 5-7 hours of sleep. I can I get up for a few hours and then go back to bed (assuming my vagal tone is not so high) and I can sleep without palpitations. I feel my heart rate is not as consistent anymore as it used to be. My resting rate is about 75-85 bpm; but goes up to about 120 or 130 when I stand up and walk around. So my questions are: (1) does this sound like vagally mediated atrial fibrillation and PVC's? (2) is an ablation a viable option for vagally mediated atrial fibrillation? (3) are there any tests that can be performed to check the function of the vagus nerve? (4) Should I also see a neurologist; and if so are there any subspecialties to look for that focus on the vagus nerve? I should note that I am seeing my electrophysiologist this week; and I am scheduled to see a gastroenterologist sometime soon. I am on diltiazem; but I only take as needed to convert out of AFib. However; I have taken the dilitiazem hoping it would help with the PVC's; but it did not seem to make a difference; and maybe even made them worse.,2010,2010,27.0,Male,i 28 year old otherwis healthi individu last april i woke one day i believ atrial fibril time emt arriv i convert the doctor hospit told sweat i two episod atrial fibril bing drink night convert i think much problem month half ago i start get pvcs everi night then week began i woke heart wild control the emt came hook 12 lead determin i heart rate 280 bpm i atrial fibril along vtach pvcs i went hospit stay 4 day they thought mayb wpw echo stress test negat delta wave problem i ep studi perform wherebi elecrophysiologist conclud atrial fibril howev i think conclus base notion unabl reproduc arrhythmia afib default answer i extens research thought arrhythmia relat gerd i notic pvcs wors acid reflux it got point everi time i would lay i would constant pvcs on thanksgiv i bad heartburn one alcohol beverag atrial fibril next morn i gone gerd friend diet wait see physician i magic felt lot better howev day later i start pvcs night time i laid rather i slept awhil i barium swallow came back negat gerd posit duoden feel lost problem i came across inform vagal mediat atrial fibril seem make sens i believ duoden caus oversecret stomach acid due vagus nerv test negat gerd i also male young otherwis healthi heart former militari athlet i pvcs occur everi 57 hour sleep i i get hour go back bed assum vagal tone high i sleep without palpit i feel heart rate consist anymor use my rest rate 7585 bpm goe 120 130 i stand walk around so question 1 sound like vagal mediat atrial fibril pvcs 2 ablat viabl option vagal mediat atrial fibril 3 test perform check function vagus nerv 4 should i also see neurologist subspecialti look focus vagus nerv i note i see electrophysiologist week i schedul see gastroenterologist sometim soon i diltiazem i take need convert afib howev i taken dilitiazem hope would help pvcs seem make differ mayb even made wors
232,Diltiazem+hypertension,Two SVT related questions: 1) I've only experienced SVT one time a few weeks ago. What are the risks for not taking anything to prevent a recurrence? Wouldn't it be OK to not take anything? Isn't it likely that I won't have a recurring episode for a long time? 2) Are there any alternatives to regular blood pressure medication for treating SVT? I was taking metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily; but this caused me to experience chest pressure. My cardiologist took me off of it and put me on a low dose of cardizem. I haven't experienced any ill effects so far from cardizem; but I would much rather find a natural treatment for SVT like acupuncture or natural medicines. I know that bearing down can help stop an episode of it... what else can be done naturally? Thanks.

233,Diltiazem+hypertension,I was diagnosed with mild left ventricular hypertrophy due probably to hypertension and told to treat the hypertension and not to worry. I had this condition for at least two years before I knew about it. It was called to my attention by an echo report in my records while attending a new physician. I have had some very rare pvcs and pacs showing up since my twenties. Suddenly lots of pacs showed up on a monitor in 2002 along with a regular two a minute about that time. There were thousands of pacs. This alarmed me ; but I was told they were benign. They seemed to go away for several years. Then in 2006- 2007 I began to have night attacks of high blood pressure and rapid pulse up to 120-150bpm at times; These were about every 3 -5 months; sometimes more and would sometimes send me to the E.R.. These attacks are very scary when waking up out of sleep usually 1:30 or 3:00 A.M. No one could decide why. Theory was anxiety attacks; or med not holding twenty four hours. I take hyzaar 50/12.5 and taztia for diltiazem 120 extended release q day. Then in February of this year I awoke in a -fibrillation went to the E.R. by ambulance and was kept at the hospital overnight. I converted into a regular rhythm with use of lanoxin and digoxin and heparin by 4:00 the next afternoon. I had just seen a cardiologist the Monday before for these recurrent night episodes and was told that I did not even need a cardiologist until this suprised even him. I saw him again the Monday after the a-fib. He said that he would just watch me and not even change any meds right now. I'm 59 and was in really good health before . This lvh disgnosis and the a-fib attack have really scared me. Can you please tell me anything about this to help my confidence or to just help me to be more informed? What more can I do? How dangerous is this?

234,Diltiazem+hypertension,"In october of last year; I went to the hospital with chest pains. My bp was 195/110. they gave me three nitro glycerin tablets before it came down. The blood test revealed no negative enzymes. That was a sat. night and I was admitted to the hospital and put on a nitro patch. 5 AM monday morning; the ekg showed that I had ""flipped my t-waves."" Up to that point the ekg hadn't changed. Tues. morning I was transferred to another hospital for a heart cath. That revealed no damage but the doctor said that part of my heart was not beating with the rest. I believe it was the anterior apical. The diagnosis based on the above info was that I had a coronary artery spasm. that there was some damage to my heart but they felt it was reverseable. I was told I have prinzmetal's angina also. I went to cardiac rehab for 3 months and was working out 4 days a weeks at the gym after I finished the rehab. A few weeks ago; I went to SLC; Utah. On both planes on the way out I had chest pains and took my nitro. The next day I had chest pains 2 more times. The hotel called the paramedics and I was taken to the er. My bp was again 190/110. I had chest pains again in the hospital and they gave me nitro and it finally came down and stayed down. After 6 hours they released me. The cardio- logist at the er in Utah said he thought I got cehst pains because of the high bp and that he wasn't convinced it was angina or that I had a CAS in October. I was dizzy off and on for the week that I was there but I thought this was due to the altitude (I live at sea level and SLC is 4500 ft.) When I returned home I was still dizzy. Went to my cardiologist and my bp was 200/100. He put me on diovan and sent me for a renal scan with flow (nuclear). the results of the renal scan were R>L 55>45. that was a couple of weeks ago. the diovan is keeping my bp around 110/70. the cario. wanted me to go to our local community hospital and have a renal angiogram and possible angioplasty. This hasn't been done at this hospital before and I don't think I want to be the first. My primary physician is sending me to another cardiologist at Temple University in Phila. for a second opinion. I see him on the 22nd of this month. This is where I get confused. Why a second cardiologist? Should I be seeing a different kind of specialist? Sorry I forgot to mention that I am 48 year old female. My father had a heart attack at 54 and he had high blood pressure although he was an acute alcoholic so I assumed the bp was from the alcohol. I don't drink (haven't in 19 years); stopped smoking 3 years ago. Smoked from 18 to 26; didn't smoke from 26 to 36; smoked from 36 to 45. I take cardizem cd 300mg; lipitor 10mg; premarin 1.25 and one aspirin daily. And now diovan 80 mg. From what I have read 55>45 doesn't sound definitive for blockage but I was told that normally the left kidney has greater flow then the right. I am wondering IF my renal artery is partially blocked; could this have been the reason for the cardiac event in October? Could it have been that my bp going so high caused damage to my heart? It was more then 2 hours before I went to the hospital and my bp was high at the hospital for a while before they finally got it down.

235,Diltiazem+hypertension,Ever since I was diagnosed with what was thought to be a MI; I have been seeking the answer to what happened. I have had a DR. here on Cleveland Clinic say from the sTress tEst I was given and the symptoms that it sounded like I did indeed have a MI; allthough a mild one probably. Also the Stress tests indicated that I may have had one and some area of damage; or what is called Stunned Myocardium. The first cardioloigst I went to did a Catherization which showed no blockages and then a Echocardiogram. I saw him today and haven't got the actuall report yet; but he told me from the symptoms I have that he now thinks what I have is Vaso spasms of the heart; or atypical angina. He talked about calcium channel blockers and using the nitro I am already taking. He based this on the symptoms and the fact that taking the nitro helped with chest symptoms after taking Nitro. The question started when I asked about Ischemia and parts of the heart not getting enough blood; / oxygen; and if you don't have blocked arteries; if you could still have symptoms if you are not getting enough blood. He said yes; then I asked about if there was any connection between Raynaulds disease and Ischemic Disease of the heart. I dont think he gave me a direct answer; but this question gave him some intersest; and when he found out I have suffered from Raynaulds since the 1980's; he seemed to be putting two and two together. The other thing I thought was interesting; was than this initial attack was very strong; and that I had several clusters of them close together from begginning of April till the end of May. I have not had a Angina attack for about 3 weeks. My attacks came with no exertion or exercise; no foods or undue stress. The fact is that I have been MORE STRESSED SINCE THE INITIAL ATTACK; BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND THE CAUSE OR DEFINITE DIAGNOSIS. So it was not anxiety; panic disorder; GERD; or anything similiar. I have severeal EKGS that mention possible Mycardial Ischmic disease. How is that diagnosed or can it be diagnosed? Has anyone else had a connection between Raynaulds Disease and this Coronary Vasospasms of the heart? I have read different things on the Web about Pretmetals Angina; is this the same thing? How often do these attacks come and go or how do you know when you will get an attack? One thing I read talked about doing the same thing you do for Heart disease; such as lowering the prevention like high blood pressure and high cholesteral; and smoking. I take meds for high blood pressure and cholesteral; and I quit smoking 30 years ago. What other things can I do to keep this under controll? I am still wondering why the dr on Cleveland Clinic had the ( apparently ) wrong diagnosis from the stress test? Thanks to everyone who helped me in trying to figure out what is going on.NOw I just need to see my Regular Dr. to see what is done next.

236,Diltiazem+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

237,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I have a nonfunctional pituitary microadenoma and was wondering when surgery is indicated. I have been to MGH for a brief appointment and they suggested that they do surgery when the tumor grows over 1 cm. This is due to the fact that in their experience; the tumors continue to grow once over 1 cm. At the time of my appointment last year; my adenoma measured 8mm x 5mm x 7mm. They thought it would probably never grow. However; a recent MRI showed that it has slight enlargement at 8mm x 9mm x 7mm. I have adrenal insufficiency secondary to ACTH insufficiency but no other hormones are deficient yet. The tumor is located along the right cavernous sinus but doesn't invade the cavernous sinus yet. I have a few questions about this. 1. When does the Cleveland Clinic operate on nonfunction pituitary microadenomas? 2. Do you ever see ACTH as being the only affected stimulating hormone or the first deficient stimulating hormone? Also; I have some T2 hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the brain consistent with microvascular changes. I'm only 39 and have some kind of autoimmune process with anticardiolipin antibodies. Could this be the cause? Should I be evaluated for something else? The pattern of the T2 hyperintensities is not consistent with MS. Could it be caused by Lyme? Will they progress?

238,Diltiazem+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic.

240,Diltiazem+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night. How worried should I be?,2009,2009,29.0,Male,i crosspost hope get differ perspect ive experienc pleas feel free read first thread i post anxieti forum ill answer question thread well headsup detail histori anxieti possibl heart problem my recent issu i wake middl night elev puls skyrocket within moment wake i went back cardiologist thursday told ekg show thicken heart muscl she review echo two year ago told show sign thicken well i went cardiologist hope allay health anxieti wors im bit mif doctor didnt keep inform go echo all i ever heard valv leak bit abnorm amount age 29 im go new echo monday ill stress test soon the stress test scare ive got stay atenolol 48 hour hand ill deal puls elev probabl wors incid heart race im look reassur anyon give hope someon similar i feel healthi im deal stuff everi night how worri i
241,Diltiazem+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think?

243,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 25 year old caucasian male of irish descent. Ever since being physically active as a child; I have had problems with muscle cramping. Strenuous and semi stressful physical exertion would often be accompanied by extreme painful muscle cramping in major leg and arm muscles. Making it difficult to move; let alone lift a particular arm or leg. Growing up I had a normal childhood riding bikes; playing baseball; tag; all the sorts of things young kids do. Often times the cramping would never present itself. Appears to almost be random. In highschool I ran cross country (not very well; however; often finished last in races due to extreme muscle cramping/pain; but I always finished a race; running through the pain. Went on to do some track and also some tennis; along with some bowling. Have experienced this extreme cramping/pain in all of these sports at one time or another. In college I did competitive fencing for two years. For the first year or so; it seemd that I was no longer presenting the symptoms described. However; a year into it I had a very stressful match and ended cramping across my entire body; not being able to move. Again; had to fight through the pain. Along with the painful cramping; another symptom has consistently presented itself. My muscles; in random places on the body; sometimes twitch or spasm. The spasms rarely last for more than 1 or 2 seconds; and seem to be random occurences. They sometimes will happen in the same area randomly for up to 10-15 minutes. It is very; very inconsistent. I also randomly somtimes experience medium to severe chest pain at random moments in time; often not accompanied with any cramping; muscle spasms; or physical activity. It can happen anywhere. Sitting down at the computer. Driving. Doing physical activity. Not doing physical activity. I had tests done at the Cleveland Clinic and they were not able to diagnose the issue. I had raised CPK and CK levels in unnaceptable leves in the thousands. However; no other enzyme or blood levels were out of whack. I had three muscle biopsies. One in my right upper thigh muscle; and one on each forearm. Tests were negative for any kinds of myopathies. Tests were negative for any severe neurological diseases like MS; MLS or any other sort of degenerative muscle disorders. Acid reflux has been toted as a likely candidate for the chest pains. Prevacid and Prilosec have both reduced chest pains slightly. However; the medium to severe chest pains have presented themselves at times when acid reflux could not possibly have been the culprit. I recently had a colonoscopy performed due to my family having a history of colon cancer. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. There was a worry that I might have inherited Crohns from my mothers side of the family; but that was not the case. I also did not appear to have IBS or anything of the sort. The only other thing I can tell you is that I have been told I have a condition called malignant hypothermia. A disorder that all anesthesialogists must be aware of prior to giving me any form of anesthesia. The Cleveland Clinic did a number of tests on me; including blood draws; muscle biopsies; ekg; though; I don't quite remember of an MRI or CT was performed. This was done when I was 19 years old. I have not had any further look into this since then; and I'm wondering what my next steps should be. Besides the unexplained muscle cramps/spasms and chest pains; I am a very healthy 25 year old male. I'm perhaps 10-15 pounds overweight; but then again who isnt. I have seasonal allergies to ragweed; pollen; mold; dust; all those. I have however never gotten an allergy ***** test. However; I'm not allergic to any of the major things like penicillin; peanuts or latex. I typically get a strep throat infection almost perhaps like clockwork every spring and fall. I don't have any sexually transmitted infections; I have never done any intravenous drugs. I've occasionally smoked marijuana and i have ingested psylocibin mushrooms one time in my entire life. I have also never broken a bone in my entire body. Mentally I have had issues with both depression and anxiety; often brought on; especially as a child; by these bizarre cramping events. Imagine having a ton of fun with other kids; only to be made fun of because I couldn't play anymore due to extreme muscle pain/soreness; being told by gym teachers and sports coaches to suck it up and quit complaining; or being called lazy because I simply could not continue with a certain physical activity due to extreme cramping and muscle pain. Also; I was told by one of the doctors that I should avoid massive amounts of caffiene. Is there any truth to this? If so; how much caffiene is bad; and should I avoid drinking anything that contains caffiene such as soda; coffee or energy drinks. On a side note; when I watch the show House M.D. I wish there were a doctor smart enough to diagnose whatever the hell it is that I have. Isn't fiction television grand :p My main concern is this.

246,Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been constipated the last couple of weeks. I took some Senokot last Tuesday to help with this. Then on Wednesday I had a bowel movement. It was really hard to pass the stools. I noticed there was blood on my stools and on the toilet paper. I went to a doctor the same day and was told it was an anal fissure. The doctor gave me hydrocortisone suppositories. I took these for a couple of days; but had to stop using them because it was too painful to use them. Also; that same day I drank some prune juice. This caused me to have diarrhea; which worsened the pain. Ever since Wednesday I have been in so much pain I have not been able to sit up; therefore have not been able to work. I have to lay on my side; I cannot even ride in a car. The pain is constant; not just when having a bowel movement. I have increased my fiber intake and fluid intake and now I'm having 1-2 soft bowel movements per day. I have been taking 3-4 tub baths in plain warm water a day. I have tried using hydrocortisone cream and anesthetic cream. None of this seems to be helping. I also noticed something strange when I was applying the cream. It looks like there is something hanging from my anus. I can't tell if it is skin or a hemorrhoid; but the doctor did not mention it. I also feel constant pressure there; like something is pushing down on me. I haven't noticed anymore blood in my stool. And yesterday I started to have itching and burning (like I'm on fire) there also. I'm not sure what to do. How long do fissures take to heal? How long do they take to stop causing so much pain? I can't miss anymore work from this; but I can't even sit up. I'm typing this standing. Could I have something else going on with me besides a fissure?

247,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Here's something that might buy some valuable time and help in a blood pressure spike. I had them for years and then not. Recently the last two or three days - I had bp go to 169/85 and I'm currently trying to figure out what caused that. I got up and had two cokes and 2 cups of coffee and we had breakfast (bought at cracker barrel restaurant) Most of the day both times it was in the 111/64 to 135/70 range - then suddenly shot up late in the day and reached over 150/75. I took extra medicationa and it didn't come down. So I'm going to tell you of a method to bring down a spike - unless caused by some secondary reason such as organ failure. its' not pleasant but it sure beats a stroke or heart attack. This is the use of prune juice to clean your sytem. I drink 32 ounces as fast as I can and I stay near the bathroom (obviously ) After passing a lot of fluid out - the pressure in the arteries goes down as fluids equalize thoughout the body. I used to be on the Bloodpressureline - where endocrinologist and hard to control hypertension specialist Dr. Clarence Grim was and when told of the prune juice method he said ""maybe we should have some clinical trials of that) He may have been joking but it works. If you drink the prune juice within an hour you will be dropping fluids in 1.5 hours and for me and most people the blood pressure will drop fast. I would stay near the bathroom. I don't personally like prune juice but we keep it on hand all the time and I used it today and yesterday and it got my bp down into thw 120/65 range and it will go lower tonight. After this all my meds work better as my bp stays down as long as I don't eat salt or what I'm suspicious of - Coffee - I take cardizem (diltiazem) and lasix. One guy on the blood pressure forum tried it and said ""I got a very nice reduction in blood pressure - but then I went and replenished the fluid that was lost and the bp came back up."" He didn't understand that most people - especially those overweight carry way too much fluid in their bodies and you take some out and you dont restore it. So if you are thinking you might be going to have a stroke or heart attack because of high blood pressure - give it a try and you should see a reduction in bp within a couple of hours. We have had times when me taking more medication did not bring the blood pressure down and the Prune Juice was the only thing that worked. My wife also has high blood pressure and was going to use ""pruny"" we call it but she hates it too. She was able to cut back on her fluid intake and her bp went down. We think it is salt and in fact when we keep the salt intake down bp stays down too - that and I love my coffee and sometimes drink too much.

250,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 44 year old registered nurse; who for the last 8 months have had right upper quadrant pain; sometimes radiating round to the back and bouts of heavy nausea. Previously in May I was diagnosed with tiny scattered ulcers from the stomach through to the small intestine; this was thought to be related to the anti-imflammatory's I had been taking for acute back pain previously experience in mid Feb to mid March. This problem is cuurently resolved. However; the ruqp and nausea has continued and after a trip to A&E who ruled out a perforated ulcer after bloods and x-rays were taken; and an admittance due to dehydration and pain mx my specialist just monitored my symptoms and treated with Motilium and analgesia. I continued to experience actue episodes of ruqp and nausea and called my gastroenterologist to help me. He arrange for me to be admitted for tests and after an Endoscopic U/S sludge was discovered in the Gall Bladder; and it was decided to remove the GB immediately. The surgeon was certain the sludge in the GB was due to 20 KGs I had loss from dieting from Feb 09 to June 09. After post -op pain had subsided I still had bouts of nausea and occasional ruqp. I visited the specialist before I took a 5 week holiday in the UK. It was decided I would continue to take the Motilium and analgesia as required. My first night I was gripped with horrendous abdominal pain totally different to before more mid-upper and under rib pain which took my breath away to descibe would say these were more like a spasm pains. I had 3 waves of these pains which all lasted about 2 minutes each and left me feeling very nauseous. Over the next 4 5 weeks the nausea came in waves and pain was intermittant. Then in Mid-October these spasm pains returned with a vengence. The next day my specialist mentioned a dysfunction called 'Sphincter of Oddi'; bloods taken were negative and he just gave me alternative options to control these spasms and nausea. Tiny mini-like-spasms felt leading up to xmas were manageable; then xmas morning the spasm came out of the blue; unbale to take the Buscopan until pain subsided I was unable to eat/drink anything all day; eating around 18.00 that evening; the same pattern the next day with some back shoulder blade pain that kept me awake all night; with one addition the sharp stabbing pain right-sided and under the ribs (just like GB pain). this became unabearable and so visited the casualty Dept; unable to be canulated due to being dehydrated; bloods were finally taken but were nagative; my pain score as the spasm and sharp pains came and went were very hight 8-9/10. I was later transferred to my pivate hospital and looked after by the specialist; where I was treated with IM Buscopan and Morphine Tabs and IM over the next 8 days.

251,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47.0,Male,i 47 year old male athlet unfortun 4 month ago i heart attackmi left ventricl arteri 100 occlud 2 regular metal stent place left arteri it big shock everybodi especi sinc cholesterol 170 time even heart attack blood pressur 12480 plus genet nobodi die heart attack among relat i eat fri fast food diet general ok my pain never stop i experienc constant chest pressur short breath doctor pay attent he say etiolog pain known shouldnt anyth cardiac sinc stress test oklast month i end emerg room restenosi one stent clog 99 anoth stent place top two this time xienc 5 drug elut stent went top two the doctor start pay littl attent even apolog listen mesinc thenit month i continu experi problem everi day i pain doesnt matter i exercis sit offic the pain may start middl chest move right left goe backupp part shoulder right breast bone hurt sometim tender touch befor i heart attack i never experienc anyth like everyth start stent place ani suggest comment great appreci i function normal i hope stem cell scienc advanc much faster anticip bring new avenu hope peopl like us
252,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Prograf is a medicine that slows down the bodys immune system. For this reason; it works as an anti-rejection medicine. Prograf helps patients who have had a liver/kidney transplant protect their new organ and prevent it from being rejected by the body. This medicine can cause the amount of potassium in your blood-stream to increase. For this reason you should avoid large amounts of foods that have a high potassium content; for example dried fruit; bananas; tomatoes and low sodium salt; while you are taking this medicine; also avoid potassium supplements. I had a bad reaction from eating these foods. I had been warned about grapefruit juice; as it increases the amount of Prograf in the blood-stream. I did not know about the problems with other foods. Being a health food addict; this is what I eat. I had noticed I had not felt good for a couple of days but did not think that much about it. After about 3 days I knew something wasn't right with my body. I went to the emergency room at my local hospital and after many blood tests I found out that I had too much potassium in my body. I was fortunate the level was not that high. It was an easy cure and I'am fine; (no damage to me or my new liver); but I wanted to warn everyone about this. My doctor told me there are many foods that are being tested to see what there reaction is when Prograf is used by a transplant recipient. The new foods being tested are all citrus fruits. Pomegranate and apricots are now being studied to see if they have the same effect as grapefruit juice; (increasing Prograf levels). My doctors advise to me is; ""If you eat something and later don't feel well; don't eat it again.""

253,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having ""unexplained"" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always ""pounding;"" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1"" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

255,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hi all; Have never been able to post before...so even though I am doing better I thought I would leave a post with some of my questions. First; thanks to the doctors and CC for creating this site. 1. I had a lone A-Fib back in July...none since. Had some PVCs in late July and early August...but hardly any since. I guess I am wondering the million dollar question...how can I keep my A-Fib episode from coming back? 2. I have heard of people having A-Fib once and it not coming back...what are the percentages on this? 3. What are the overall numbers of no A-Fib recurrence for someone cardioverted? That was what was weird about mine...I stayed in it at the hospital for about 10 hours and the meds were not converting me...is this cause for concern? 4. I have been exercising (2 miles 4xs a week); and doing yard work type stuff. I am still afraid to lift heavy objects; and play basketball or football...would any of these things increase the risk. 5. It seems like A-Fib doesn't have to effect life exp. or quality of life...thoughts? 6. I went to see a regional research center EP in mid August. He looked over my myriad tests from both March and July. He said he saw a totally healthy heart and ""zero"" reason to even do an EP study...I assume there is no reason for another opinion? 7. Docs who cardioverted me put me on 120mg of Cartia and after Coumadin for 3 weeks I am now on aspirin...does this sound about right? 8. My AF just appeared out of nowhere when I rolled over in bed one night...any reason for concern?

256,Diltiazem+hypertension,": Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on ""spectral"" and ""verapimil"". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible. I feel mine very strongly and they leave me somewhat short of breath after continuing for longer than about 1 minute (30-40 PVCs in one minute). I have tried most of the ""...lol"" meds (sotalol; pindolol; spectral; atenolol; acebutolol; enderal)and a few combinations of the above without any real relief.

Wichert 801 Date Drive Pearl City; HI 96782 or e-mail me at ***@****. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply. Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as ""non-sustained"". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one.

258,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong.

259,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 46 yr old fem. fit & in good health; B/P 110/70. In June '02; I got sick with an illness which had the major symptom of orthostatic hypotension & other organ symptoms. After 1 wk I could only crawl on my hands/knees due to fainting/weakness.I was sent to Stanford Med Ctr for 10 days.Had an echocardiogram; blood tests; tilt table testing; etc.I was on IV only for 10 days.Their diag: Orthostatic hypotension & gave proamitine. Proamitine made me sick & altered.They sent me home 2 days later & my GP took me off Proamitine as he thought I had a bad virus.After 9 wks I started to get better;no more cardiac symptoms;just getting my strength & life back.Then in March 03; I had tightness in my chest; squeezing in left arm.I went to the ER. B/P was 160/100 and pulse was 180.EKG showed no abnormalities.I was given an Ativan and refered to a cardiologist.I did a Holter monitor and a stress echo.Holter showed several instances of 148 BPM while showering; or just sitting and several PAC/PVC's some coming every other beat.Stress echo showed several PAC's & PVC's that lessened with exercise. After reviewing the Stress Echo/Holter;was told I have benign PVC's & PAC's and just deal with them or take beta blockers.I asked why all of a sudden I started having PAC's PVC's they said they didn't know.I asked if they would go away-they said no.Can someone tell me why these all of a sudden cropped up; and what can be done for them? I have multiple per minute and am uncomfortable. Are these as benign as they say? Organs just don't start acting up for no reason do they? What can I do?

260,Diltiazem+hypertension,I read the article from Science Daily Feb. 08 and the articles on Hepatitis Central; Liver Foundation and Hepatitis Foundation International. They seem real positive about grapefruit. They also list a few drugs which can't be taken with grapefruit. Just came back from my doctor and he said I could have it. He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit! Going to be shot 17 tomorrow and feel good today! UND at 12 week and doc says I have a 60-65% chance of clearing. Thanks to all of you for helping to keep me positive.

262,Diltiazem+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms.

263,Diltiazem+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me.

264,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I have been suffering from episodes of pain and discomfort in the epi-gastric area. It feels like I am going to have a heart attack; it is a pressure/discomfort in upper abdomen and back between shoulder blades with palpitations and difficulty getting a deep breath. It seems to come on as an ""attack"". I find that it happens most during my walks for exercise; when bending over; before or after meals; and also before bowel movements. I have had several tests run: abdominal ultrasound normal; several EKG's normal; Echocardiogram showing MItral Valve Prolapse; Endoscopy showing gastritis; eosinophilic esophagitis; incompetent LES. I have been taking Achipex in the AM and Zantac in the PM. Plus really watching what I am eating. It seems to be OK for awhile and then like out of the blue I will get one of these attacks.

265,Diltiazem+hypertension,I have a scheduled ablation this Friday. I was diagnosed with SVT and I didn't even know I had it. I get a lot of palpitations and I am currently on 25mg of beta blocker x2 a day. I want to know if the ablation is worth it. Will it get rid of my palpitations? The alternative is to go on 50mg x2 a day. I don't know if I want to be on that much beta blocker at such a young age (23). I think I had an SVT once and that was a year ago playing basketball; I came down from a shot and landed hard and my heart started beating fast and weird and I couldn't control it.

266,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations?

267,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

268,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this ""discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out."" I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel ""normal"" again.

271,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I believe I suffer from white coat hypertension. Earlier (until a year ago); when I didn't care about my blood pressure; I always had excellent results when my doctor measured it (115-120/60-70). After I started worrying about my heart (not so much anymore; I usually try my best to help people on the heart rhythm community) my BP readings are higher. I feel my muscles get tense and my heart starts pounding when the cuff inflates; and blood pressure is 140-155/80-95. At home; I get similar symptoms on the first measuring; but it resolves and gradually slows to 120/70 after some tries. I measured it one weekend after a good night of sleep and it was 105/55. I was completely relaxed; for once; at that time. What is quite strange; is that I imagine this started when I started using propranolol (20 mg) for PACs and sinus tachycardia. After this; my heart didn't race when I got scared; but beat harder instead. When I was really scared; I actually had bradycardia; but I got a strange sensation that my blood vessels were constricted (may be imagination..) I got my beta blocker changed to metoprolol (25 mg) and I feel my anxiety getting a bit stronger. But now my heart races a bit more in response to anxiety. Can propranolol actually contribute to higher blood pressure with stress? Are my assumptions correct that propranolol works better on anxiety due to the non-selective effect? Is my BP really normal? My heart is otherwise fine with normal chambers; wall dimensions and excellent contractility (EF 78%). I have some PACs but I'm otherwise healthy; exercise 3 times/week and normal weight.

272,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello everyone. I am new to this group. I am a 44 year old female. Never had high BP before. It was always around 120/80 except during pregnancy. For whatever the reason it would elevate then. About a year ago during a routine GYN exam; my doctor told me that when I came in and the nurse took my BP that it was very high. 175/115. He asked me if I had previously had any BP problems before and I said not that I know of. So he was nervous for me and wanted me to go to the hospital. But I was able to immediately get an appointment with my primary doctor and went right in to see him. He put me on a BP med which didn't agree with me and so I eventually stopped taking it. When I went back to see him to get a new medication to try; my BP wasn't bad so he said let's just monitor it to see if it goes back up. It didn't. But then it started to be 140/90 and it would sometimes go to 150/90 and now it is 160/100. So it went back up again. I went to see him the other day because for the past week I have not been feeling well and new something was off. I have been having a pain in my neck and hearing a heartbeat in my ear and having a lot of headaches. So he said that he is going to start me on a water pill to see if that helps to lower it. Now previously; in the past I had once been put on Furosemide. I had a bad reaction to it. I had some of the side effects listed under dangerous side effects and had to stop taking it. So I reminded my doctor of that and he put me on Hydrochlorothiazide. I took this for one day and was extremely sick the whole day. I started with some dizziness; and headache; then went to cramps which turned into very bad cramps. I wasn't too concerned at first because I read that as your body adjusts to it you can get a bit dizzy; and headache; and stomach upset. But when the cramps started getting so bad; I got worried. I began having diarrhea This continued on and off throughout the day. I called the pharmacist and asked if this was normal and he said no. That it was not normal and to not take it the next day and to tell my doctor. So I have to tell my doctor today and ask if there is something else I can take. I would like to know from anyone here if there is a water pill that you know of that is gentle on a sensitive stomach. Any advice would help.

275,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Hello; I'm 45yo.caucasian male.Height 173 cm; Weight 68 kg.2;5 months ago I started taking Lodoz 2;5 mg (bisoprolol with diuretic); blood persure before taking medicine was approximately 160/100. The medicine was prescribed in the same dose by general practice doctor 2;5 months ago . In the meantime I did ultrasound of the heart and the result seems to be OK. as wel as EKG. In addition to hypertension I have high cholesterol values(Tested on 20/03/2009: Choletsrol was 5;6; LDL= 3;5 ; HDL =1;42; b on 05/05/2009 i did another test in different lab; results were Cholesterol= 6.9; LDL=4;90; HDL=1;20. I do not take any drug for cholesterol;have started using fermented red rice. I am still smoking. "" Lodoz""2;5 mg seems to control my blood preasure fine. I don't have problems with heart rate (usually between 70 and 80 during the day and around 60 in the morning) before taking beta blocker I usually had quite high HR (approximately 90) I'm writing all this because it seems that I started to suffer from ""Erectile Dysfunction""or at least everything seems to be pretty much different than before. Behavior has been changing during period of taking drug. In the meantime I was reading a lot and would appreciate professional help;advice; suggestions and comments. I have found out that there is not easy to stop taking ""BETA BLOCKERS"" if needed it has to be gradually. I wonder would it be worth of trying switching to other BETA BLOCKER that is more selective such as ""NEBIVOLOL"". ; could I switch to ACE inhibitor (was taking one 5 years ago; they were working for me at that time as well.My blood pressure was then marginal and quit after about month and a half) or maybe should I switch to something like ""LOSARTAN"" Thank You very much for help in advance Kind regards; Bruno",2009,2009,,Male,hello im 45yocaucasian maleheight 173 cm weight 68 kg25 month ago i start take lodoz 25 mg bisoprolol diuret blood persur take medicin approxim 160100 the medicin prescrib dose general practic doctor 25 month ago in meantim i ultrasound heart result seem ok wel ekg in addit hypertens i high cholesterol valuestest 20032009 choletsrol 56 ldl 35 hdl 142 b 05052009 anoth test differ lab result cholesterol 69 ldl490 hdl120 i take drug cholesterolhav start use ferment red rice i still smoke lodoz25 mg seem control blood preasur fine i dont problem heart rate usual 70 80 day around 60 morn take beta blocker i usual quit high hr approxim 90 im write seem i start suffer erectil dysfunctionor least everyth seem pretti much differ behavior chang period take drug in meantim i read lot would appreci profession helpadvic suggest comment i found easi stop take beta blocker need gradual i wonder would worth tri switch beta blocker select nebivolol could i switch ace inhibitor take one 5 year ago work time wellmi blood pressur margin quit month half mayb i switch someth like losartan thank you much help advanc kind regard bruno
276,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits. Since late April; however; the systolic has risen to an average of around 150. My doctor wants me to add a beta blocker to the other medications. Since last October my heart rate was averaging below 60. Since late April it is averaging around 70. My concern is that taking both Amlodipine and a beta blocker may reduce my heart rate to an unacceptably low level. Do you consider the adding of a beta blocker to be the best course or; instead; should I try 1) increasing the Amlodipine to 10mg daily and/or 2) adding a duretic.,2007,2011,,Male,i male 70 year age i 150mg irbesartan 5mg amlodipin daili sinc octob 2010 this control bp within accept limit sinc late april howev systol risen averag around 150 my doctor want add beta blocker medic sinc last octob heart rate averag 60 sinc late april averag around 70 my concern take amlodipin beta blocker may reduc heart rate unaccept low level do consid ad beta blocker best cours instead i tri 1 increas amlodipin 10mg daili andor 2 ad duret

280,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,At my recent physical; my doctor took my blood pressure while I was crying and deemed it high and prescribed me medication for it. This was surprising to me as it normally is around 115/75 to 125/85 except that day when we took my pressure while I was crying it was 161-92. I've been monitoring it since that time (I haven't started the pills yet) and my blood pressure still remains around 115/75 to 125/85 with the a slight increase immediately after exertion (up to 143/85). Is it accurate to read a person's blood pressure when they are obviously emotionally upset and base your medical opinion on that reading?

282,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello! I have been on my medical journey for almost 8 years now. I am 29 y/o female; 120lbs 5'6. I have hypertension and vascular insufficiency along with fluctuating aldosterone and renin levels. My blood pressure is currently under control with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 90mg of adalat cc. However; the blood pooling in my legs causes me great discomfort even when standing for short periods of time; I have researched POTS and that seems to fit except for the fact that I have high blood pressure. Has anyone else had similar symptoms as a young woman and found a diagnosis at some point? I have made my rounds to numerous nephrologists; hypertension specialists; pulmonologists; endocrinologists; and cardiologists to no avail other than the suggestion I have hyperaldosteronism that was later ruled out. Renal artery stenosis is also something I have been tested for but some physicians have still suspected it. I am being referred to a cardiologist again due to the increasing issue I have having with circulation. My husband and I don't have kids yet and are uncomfortable even considering the possibility until more conclusive findings occur.

283,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Thank you so much for answering my questions.I'm a 48 year old female. Along with the hypothyroid problem -I take metformin (500mg with meals)for insulin resistance. I was told it was 'borderline type II Diabetes'. So; would that be the problem then? If so how would I handle that? I've also had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia -though a lot of the symptoms have eased (if not abated yet);since starting thyroid med. The only BP that I take is HCTZ diuretic(hydrochlorothiazide) 25mgs in the morning. Would you consider that aggressive enough treatment? I was prescribed Inderal initially; along with the diuretic. But it caused a problem with worsening hypothyroid symptoms;(blocks conversion of T4-T3)- so I was put on the Ace Inhibitor Altace (with HCTZ). After 2 weeks I was tested and showed a marked problem with creatinine levels. I wonder -if I'm only able to tolerate a diuretic (as it would appear) - whether a change to a stronger one like Lasix (Furosemide) might do some good in dropping the extreme BP spikes? Its good to know hypothyroid doesn't cause the BP problem. I'm wondering if levels of thyroid MEDICATION might - even though levels are presently optimized? BP readings done on multiple days.

However I am concerned as I suffer from high blood pressure and racing heartbeat and now I am afraid to take the Lexapro as I fear its going to worsen my not so good blood pressure and heart rate. Is this a valid cause for concern? I DONT want higher blood pressure and heart rate. Should I continue taking the Xanax as prescribed if I dont wish to take the lexa?

290,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi All; I have been suffering form Hypertension for Past 3 months .I feel giddiness . I went to cardiologist and When I was diagnosed ; I had BP around 160/110 and Pulse rate 93 BPM. I took ECG and reading was normal. I gave all the blood test which Includes Kidney profile; Glucose & LDL & HDL. Everything is normal. My doctor prescribed me telmisartan 40 Mg . I took that for one month and later revisited same doctor. Pressure was around 150/100 again. So doctor prescribed me telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide - 40mg tablets. Last month I felt severe giddiness and visited another doctor. She measured BP and it was around 140/90 and she told me that because of elmisartan hydrochlorothiazide tablets ; I'm getting giddiness. She changed the tablet to Losartan 50 mg . Still I face minor giddiness and pressure was not reduced. My questions are 1) Why I got Hypertension at this age even though all my blood results are normal. Is it stress related 2) Should I Take medicines for Life Long? 3) Eventhough after taking medicines also ; my BP never come to 120/80 ? What is the reason?

292,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi - I am new to this forum. Starting a few mos ago; I had sudden onset malignant hypertension (250/150!) - always had low BP before this. Coincidently; also developed a 7cm ovarian cyst on left ovary. I have had US (both kinds); CT; and MRI and some descriptions were simple cyst; hemmoragic cyst; complex cyst; endometrioma (depending on who was reading it). Every Dr I've spoken to has acted like it was a something we could wait and watch while they searched for a cause of my sudden-onset hypertension. However; I also stopped having periods since Sept (the hypertension started in mid-summer) and my FSH and LH are very high; so the Drs say I am in menopause. I just turned 44; which I realize isn't young; but sudden menopause? and why is it a functional cyst if I'm in menopause? Also; my estrogen and testosterone are in the range of someone in normal reproductive years. I keep thinking all these things are related; but the Drs act like they are all unrelated coincidences (one guy actually said I simply had incredibly bad luck - rofl). Has anyone else developed hypertension w/ an ovarian cyst or ovarian cancer? My CA125 was 15 and I have a history of endometriosis on the same ovary (endometrioma removed 12 yrs ago). I also have the creepy bloating that many people on here have mentioned and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Has anyone else else had this sort of combination of things happen suddenly?

293,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"6 monthes ago I started getting shortness of breath in the shower in the morning. It has gotten progressively worse. Mostly with exertion. I also get light headed and have dizzy spells. 3 monthes ago; I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. During routine work-up; an echo was done. My pulmonary pressure was 44. They repeated it a month later and it was 43. I was seen by a specialist who felt he needed to do a right heart catheterization. It was normal. An ECG and stress test have been normal. All bloodwork is normal. For the last couple of monthes; I have intermittent pressure down the centre of my chest. It can sometimes last all day for a short time. No shortness of breath associated with it. I am not panicky when it happens. It doesn't feel cardiac to me. In fact; I usually feel fine other than that. Eventually; I feel a ""forced cough"". Its like a balloon that is deflating and it is sputtering. Its like something is pushing air out. Its weird. The pressure is occurring more and more frequently. The cardiologist that did the stress test said that my blood pressure is constricting my pulmonary arteries causing my SOB. My BP has been ranging 94/50 to 110/76. I take half of a hydrochlorothiazide. My family doctor thought maybe its anxiety so she put me on Buspar. She doesn't yet know about the chest pressure or cough. The Buspar has not changed any of the physical symptoms. The specialist said after the RHC that maybe if it is in fact pulmonary hypertension; it maybe just too early to pick up.

294,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; Diagnosed with variable blood pressure. If I take my BP while seated or reclined - after relaxing; it is always hypotension (ie 68/40; 56/38)It gets even lower at night. If I've just walked in to do so; without relaxing first it always quite high (ie 168/135; 172/139) and takes a long while to come down. Given HCTZ (25mgs) for hypertension. Unable to tolerate Ace Inhibitor (Altace) and Beta Blocker (Inderal). (I take thyroid replacement hormone for hypothyroid and Inderal blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 hormone. The Altace raised creatinine levels). Being hypothyroid I really have to be vigilent about exercise; or the weight piles on. But; I'm really nervous about exercising now that I have this wonky BP. I always thought with hypertension a person's BP was up ALL the time. Are these kinds of WILD swings; common? Should I be limiting activity? I really don't have to do a lot to really raise it from hypotension to hypertension-just walk across the room - so what will exercise do to it? What causes such wide swings? I've struggled to finally get the hypothyroid meds optimized and within range; and I feel pretty good. Now I find out I have this weird BP thing too. What hypertension meds will not interfer with thyroid meds? Would you recommend a stronger diuretic (furosimide)? Does furosimide interfer with thyroid hormone replacement? Is there a hypertension med you'd recommend? Can thyroid CAUSE this variable BP problem? Can thyroid meds cause it? Should I be as scared as I am that my BP is all over the map?

298,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Maria on August 13; 1998 at 02:55:05: I am 37 years old and currently taking tenormin 100mg daily; zestril 20mg daily; and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and still struggle with high blood readings. My doctor wants to keep me on these meds for another month and then come back and see him. I have been on tenormin for 7 years; zestril for 3 years; and hydrochlorothiazide for 10 months. I have a family history of hypertension; heart disease (father and mother suffered strokes; father had bypass surgery in Sept. 97 following 2 heart attacks)and diabetes. If my high blood pressure doesn't go down; what should be the next step in treatment? I had a EKG done in June 98 and it came back normal. My readings vary from 140-160(top no.) to 88-110 (bottom no.) Sometimes higher when I am feeling sick and too much stress. I also had blood work done and I have high cholesterol. I try to eat right and walk and working on losing weight. What else can I do to improve my hypertension. Lately I have been feeling lightheaded and nauseous and getting more headaches than usual.

Could this be from the meds? Also can your body build up a tolerance to meds over the years? Thank you for your advice and suggestions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Maria You should eliminate salt from your diet. In some patients this step makes their blood pressure much easier to control. You should also not take ibuprofen (found in Motrin or Advil); that whole class of medicines; called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents; can contribute to high blood pressure. Many nasal decongestants can contribute to high blood pressure. You should avoid alcohol and tobacco. If you are overweight; just losing 5 to 10 pounds can make a big difference. Of course; you should take your medicines every day and not skip doses. If you are taking certain herbal medicines; these can sometimes cause high blood pressure also. If the above measures don't work; you could be started on a fourth blood pressure medicine. Before doing that; I would make sure you do not have a rare cause of high blood pressure that would be treated surgically or kidney disease causing high blood pressure. Your doctor should know which tests to order to rule out the causes of secondary hypertension. I do not know what could be causing your headaches. Sometimes if blood pressure is very elevated it can cause headaches. Lightheadedness could be caused by blood pressure being too low. You do not build up a tolerance to these medicines over time. I hope this is useful. Good luck. Feel free to write back with further questions.

302,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I went to the doctor yesterday and I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure. I am really skeptical about taking this medication; or any medication for that matter. I am 21 years old and I cannot figure out why my blood pressure is high in the first place. I do have a lot of anxiety problems and I wonder if that contributes to it. I also take Paxil for my anxiety and I have been told that can cause high blood pressure. So my questions are: Is hydrochlorothiazide something that can be discontinued later after my blood pressure lowers or is it a drug that is meant to be taken long term? Has anyone had experience with Paxil causing high blood pressure? Thanks.,2011,2011,20.0,Male,hello i went doctor yesterday i prescrib hydrochlorothiazid blood pressur i realli skeptic take medic medic matter i 21 year old i figur blood pressur high first place i lot anxieti problem i wonder contribut i also take paxil anxieti i told caus high blood pressur so question is hydrochlorothiazid someth discontinu later blood pressur lower drug meant taken long term has anyon experi paxil caus high blood pressur thank

307,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Based on my analysis of blood tests; my 70-year old aunt currently has Stage 3b CKD and is actually close to Stage 4. Back in 8/2008; her GFR was 49.5. A year later; it's 32. This is a loss of 17.5ml/min over 12 months. Every test I looked at; her BUN (22-23); Creatinine (1.3-1.6) and Choloride (112) are elevated. I suspect it was out-of-control hypertension which caused her kidney function to deteriorate. I measured her BP at 200/110 several occasions over the weekend. She says she was stressed out on weekends. But her resting BP on weekdays was still around 160/100. I don't know what her internist has been doing but they apparently thought her hypertension was under control. She stopped taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg; something she was on; a while ago. I put her back on it and made an appointment with her internist so that a nephrologist can be seen. What are we looking at here? Am I correct in my analysis? I had to self-teach nephrology in 2 days! I'm more concerned about the rapid decline in GFR than her 3b being so close to 4. We just ordered her November blood results to be sent and I'm afraid to look at the results and see really how low her GFR has gotten this time.,2009,2010,45.0,Male,base analysi blood test 70year old aunt current stage 3b ckd actual close stage 4 back 82008 gfr 495 a year later 32 this loss 175mlmin 12 month everi test i look bun 2223 creatinin 1316 cholorid 112 elev i suspect outofcontrol hypertens caus kidney function deterior i measur bp 200110 sever occas weekend she say stress weekend but rest bp weekday still around 160100 i dont know internist appar thought hypertens control she stop take hydrochlorothiazid 25mg someth ago i put back made appoint internist nephrologist seen what look am i correct analysi i selfteach nephrolog 2 day im concern rapid declin gfr 3b close 4 we order novemb blood result sent im afraid look result see realli low gfr gotten time
308,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi there. I am a female; 19 years old; otherwise in good health and weight. My electrophysiologist recently put me on a beta blocker (Metoprolol) 25 mg twice a day for hypertension and a ton of other symptoms he said must be due to Neurocardiogenic Syncope. I was diagnosed with asthma a couple years ago and it seems as if the beta blocker is causing shortness of breath and a feeling that seems similar to how I feel after exercising; a sort of chest tightness I would say. Is this common for beta blockers to do to people with asthma? I am afraid that the dose will be increased as my blood pressure is still high (last two readings were 132/100 and 140/92). I am going to talk to my PCP tomorrow about it as well.,2008,2009,,,hi i femal 19 year old otherwis good health weight my electrophysiologist recent put beta blocker metoprolol 25 mg twice day hypertens ton symptom said must due neurocardiogen syncop i diagnos asthma coupl year ago seem beta blocker caus short breath feel seem similar i feel exercis sort chest tight i would say is common beta blocker peopl asthma i afraid dose increas blood pressur still high last two read 132100 14092 i go talk pcp tomorrow well
309,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I recently suffered severe pain abdominal after taking Tylenol #3's for a migraine. I was told that codeine causes spasms of the sphincter of oddi. Felt like the most terrible gallbladder attack of my life - altho I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Since then; my abdomen just under my ribs on BOTH sides is really sore; but particularly bad on the upper left side; going into my back. Kind of a dull boring pain - unless I move suddenly without thinking - then its severe. I don't know if its coincidental that this came on after the 'oddi' incident or not. I DO have a small hiatal hernia. I take thyroid replacement hormone; Metformin 500mg 3 times a day with meals; and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. WOULD ANY OF THESE MEDS CAUSE THIS KIND OF PAIN? SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT PANCREAS PROBLEMS? STONES? WOULD THE HERNIA CAUSE THIS TYPE OF PAIN? I'm a 48 year old female.

314,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I just today had a doctor prescribe hydrochlorothiazide to me. I filled the prescription and then came home and phoned my oldest friend in the world; a 59 yr old Internal Medicine specialist to talk to him about it. His initial reaction was; and I quote; ""I wouldn't take that stuff!"". He told me that I should tell the first doctor that; after researching the hydrochlorothiazide; I am fearful of taking what he prescribed and that what I would like is for him to prescribe an ace inhibitor. I have NEVER liked taking pills and am not sure what to do. Any thoughts? I will be 59 yrs old in 3 months. btw; the first doctor also prescribed 81mg aspirin. My doctor friend back east told me that the most recent studies have shown that an aspirin regimen has little to no effect on someone until AFTER they have had a heart attack or other...

315,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 34 yrs old male; from India. I am overweight by 30 - 50 lbs. I try to exercise everyday and have developed fair stamina by exercising. I have an average to good physique. Till now; the only physical problem I have is Hypertension. I used to take Amlodopine 5 mg tablets fdaily or a long time [5-6 yrs]. Before 2 years the drug was chaged to 'Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide'. This is also a same 5mg tablet that I am taking daily. Recently my BP is more in normal range; even if I dont take the BP medication for a couple of days. I used to masterbate since I was 14. Have a very good sex drive. I think out of fear of impregnating my partner; whenever we do sex without a condom; I use to come very fast. But with a condom I can go on for 5-10 mins of thrusting apart from all the foreplay before it. - I used to follow the 'start and stop' method. Since last 2 months; I am noticing that; I do not have much control on my ejaculation. As soon as I proceed for penetration; I am coming too fast; even within 1 min. Sometimes as soon as my partner touches my penis. - Also; I am noticing that; I can not force the flow of my urine as I could do in past. Are both of these happenning because of weak PBG muscles?Can only kegel cure these? Should I stop my BP medication. Please suggest; what action should I take. Thank you very much Doctors for your help beforehand.,2011,2011,,Male,i 34 yrs old male india i overweight 30 50 lbs i tri exercis everyday develop fair stamina exercis i averag good physiqu till physic problem i hypertens i use take amlodopin 5 mg tablet fdaili long time 56 yrs befor 2 year drug chage ramipril hydrochlorothiazid this also 5mg tablet i take daili recent bp normal rang even i dont take bp medic coupl day i use masterb sinc i 14 have good sex drive i think fear impregn partner whenev sex without condom i use come fast but condom i go 510 min thrust apart foreplay i use follow start stop method sinc last 2 month i notic i much control ejacul as soon i proceed penetr i come fast even within 1 min sometim soon partner touch peni also i notic i forc flow urin i could past are happen weak pbg musclescan kegel cure should i stop bp medic pleas suggest action i take thank much doctor help beforehand
316,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern.

317,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I've noticed over the last few years that my top number is going up; although my bottom number is around 70. Each doctor seems very unconcerned; and they always seem to blame it on stress. Well once it was my physician and I had a bad cold; the next time it was at my dentist's; and today at a rather stressful checkup for something unrelated. I always had around 115/70; but now it's been at around 125-130 and today it was 143 (although as I said; I was FILLED with anxiety at this visit...) The bottom number today was 73. What should I; do I need to do next?!,2008,2008,,Female,ive notic last year top number go although bottom number around 70 each doctor seem unconcern alway seem blame stress well physician i bad cold next time dentist today rather stress checkup someth unrel i alway around 11570 around 125130 today 143 although i said i fill anxieti visit the bottom number today 73 what i i need next
318,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 38 year old black male in excellent shape!! Two years ago I began having Palpitations which continues today. I reported my symtoms to the Flight Surgeon (FS). The Flight surgeon ordered an 24 hour monitor which showed I was having PVCs; about 4-5 per day. Also the monitor revealed I had a non-recurring 4-beat run of V-tack which brought about more test. I was given the Treadmill Stress test; Echo; Stress Echo; Calcium Florscope scan; chest X-ray; and a Thalium Stress test. All of the above mentioned test reveall my heart was normal no MVP or anything. The test however; did stress me a bit; so I now take 12.5mg Hydrochlorothiazide and 20mg of Zesttril daily for mild Hypertension. My BP is well controlled 116/72. My question is: Can an individual have a v-tack episode and have a normal heart; does one's heart need to be electrically or structural abnormal for this to take place? And what do I do about these PVC's? The FS say to forget about them until I am able to take a Bata-blocker after my Military flying career is over. (Not allowed on flying status) This site is wonderful for persons like me!!

319,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I'm 4 weeks pregnant & had high BP before becomiong pregnant. I was on Toprol XL 25 mg once daily. I went to an OB/GYN today who said my BP was still running high and upped my dose to Toprol 50 mg once daily. When I called my pharmacist; he said he did not think Toprol was the best thing to take for BP during pregnancy to ask for something safer. My questions are: Is it safe to take Toprol during pregnancy? If not; what BP medicine should I ask my OB/GYN to put me on? My BP is about 133/90-100 on average. I'm 27 yrs old; & this is my 2nd pregnancy. I DID NOT have toxemia during 1st pregnancy. But developed high BP after the birth. Thanks....

321,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 49-year-old man who has been diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency ; along with as-yet unhealed leg ulcers of my lower left leg for the past three years. In addition; I suffered a stoke this spring when plaque in my Carotid artery broke free and entered the brain. Also; moderately high blood pressure necessitating the use of 40mg of Diovan each day; along with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide each day to control the blood pressure; along with statins to control cholesterol and hopefully gradually dissolve the plaque buildups. Now recently; my brother suffered a heart attack; putting him on ventilator; necessitating a transfer of him to a rehabilitation facility about 7 hrs away. Now; I have been driving the 14 hr trip every other week to visit with him. Now; my concern is; (I would normally take this up with my physician but I don't see him for another 2 months).....Am I at any greater risk of developing a clot (DVT) in the leg with the ulcer; leading to a pulmonary embolism....because of my circulatory issues with my leg and my high blood pressure ? I understand that some people who travel by plane frequently or are otherwise forced to sit in a fixed position for long periods of time are at higher risk....but would my circulatory issues increase that risk even more ?,2009,2009,,Male,im 49yearold man diagnos chronic venous insuffici along asyet unheal leg ulcer lower left leg past three year in addit i suffer stoke spring plaqu carotid arteri broke free enter brain also moder high blood pressur necessit use 40mg diovan day along 25mg hydrochlorothiazid day control blood pressur along statin control cholesterol hope gradual dissolv plaqu buildup now recent brother suffer heart attack put ventil necessit transfer rehabilit facil 7 hrs away now i drive 14 hr trip everi week visit now concern i would normal take physician i dont see anoth 2 monthsam i greater risk develop clot dvt leg ulcer lead pulmonari embolismbecaus circulatori issu leg high blood pressur i understand peopl travel plane frequent otherwis forc sit fix posit long period time higher riskbut would circulatori issu increas risk even

326,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I have taken a large amount of medications over the last 20 years: Depakote ER; Remeron; antipsychotic for short time; Hydrochlorothiazide; Atenenol; Trileptal; Luvox; Synthroid; Tiazac; Lipiter; insulin and some others. I have struggled most of this time with uncontrolable diarreahea. Eventually I started taking Imodium AD which helped to some extent. After a colonoscopy and tests for anything that shouldn't exist in the colon; ie: parasites etc. my surgeon told me my problem was all the meds I was taking (it was enough to kill me) that my colon is healthy. Working with my other doctors I have reduced a number of the meds without harm. I am still on meds for Diabetes; for Hypertension; and for Low Thyroid. Generally; I am in good health; physically and mentally active. However; I still suffer the diarreahea that comes in fits after I eat a meal and often when I am out shopping; or walking for excercise. I find the Imodium helpful to some extent; but I can never be sure it is enough to prevent sudden bouts of the diarreahea. I drink plenty of water daily to prevent dehydration and eat conservative meals. I have lost 30 pounds intentionally as I was overweight due to medications. There is no blood or ""fats"" in the stools. They are a normal medium brown in color; sometimes they have been very dark almost black. Seldom have I appreciated a solid stool. I have searched the internet regarding IBS; IB; Colitis; etc. and have yet to find my symptoms of anything to match. It is as though I have too much water in the colon to be absorbed normally and everything just washes out at its own will.

327,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 45 year old female and had a baby 3 months ago. I developed hypertension after she was born and was put on 200 mg Labetalol twice a day. It did what it was supposed to do; however I also developed post partum anxiety/depression and was put on Escitalopram; Alprazolam (as needed) and klonopin (1mg) at night only. The side effects of the labetalol for me were awful; so once my readings got better; I weaned off of it and am now not taking anything for Bp which usually stays in a good range (120-135 over 78-85). Some days it's a bit high and some days it's normal. 2 nights ago it spiked to 163/99 and my heart rate went down to 51. This concerns me as I had Bradychardia after my baby was born and the BP was high; but it went back to normal. It went back to normal/borderline over the past couple of days; however I also started taking Hydrochlorothiazide the morning after the spike (prescribed by my ENT for pressure and tinnitus in my left ear). So I guess my question is; is the low heart rate normal with that type of BP spike? They did an echocardiogram when I was hospitalized after my baby was born and said it was fine and my EKG's were fine; etc. Obviously with my anxiety; this still worries me. My cardiologist does NOT want to change my BP med; even though I told her that the side effects were bad on the labetalol and made my anxiety worse. I know there are a LOT of BP meds out there. I am not breast feeding; so that isnt' in the equation.

331,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

332,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello I've been diagnosed with PAC's for 25 years; noticed them from time to time but once diagnosed; never thought that much about them. They are not enjoyable; but at the same time; not that serious. About 3 years ago I had extensive lithotripsy (3K pulses) to remove a large kidney stone; since then I've had several other stones; none that required ESWT; but noticed a general rise in my B.P. It went; over a period of 2 or 2 1/2 years; from 130/82 to 180/107 on a regular basis. Suspicions arose that perhaps renal artery stenosis had occured and I was placed on a number of B.P. meds; none of which helped. My most recent MRA showed no stenosis of the main artery to either kidney. At the same time as the MRA; I was placed on Hydroclhlorothiazide. Within a few days; my blood pressure had dropped to 107/72; sometimes even lower. At the same time; my incidence of PAC's increased quite noticeably. I had been given propanolol to use if needed for the PAC's and took it rarely. Now I need it often twice a day. Is there any relationship between the lowered B.P. and increase in PAC's or am I just noticing them more due to the lowered B.P.? I can live with the PAC's as I much prefer that to the hypertension problem; just wondered if there is a connection. I'm taking; in addition to the hydrochlorothiazide; Benicar 20mg/day and Coreg 10mg/day. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated.,2007,2007,,,hello ive diagnos pac 25 year notic time time diagnos never thought much they enjoy time serious about 3 year ago i extens lithotripsi 3k puls remov larg kidney stone sinc ive sever stone none requir eswt notic general rise bp it went period 2 2 12 year 13082 180107 regular basi suspicion aros perhap renal arteri stenosi occur i place number bp med none help my recent mra show stenosi main arteri either kidney at time mra i place hydroclhlorothiazid within day blood pressur drop 10772 sometim even lower at time incid pac increas quit notic i given propanolol use need pac took rare now i need often twice day is relationship lower bp increas pac i notic due lower bp i live pac i much prefer hypertens problem wonder connect im take addit hydrochlorothiazid benicar 20mgday coreg 10mgday ani thoughtsidea would appreci

I am getting so sick of not knowing what is going on and I’m sick of the pain; dizziness the weakness diarrhea and vomiting it happens every couple of months.

336,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"BACKGROUND: I'm 28 living in Madrid and recently given Losartan (100mg) hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) to control hypertension. Because I'm pretty young for hypertension this prescription was also accompanied by an extensive batter of tests (blood tests for kidney and liver function; ultrasound of heart; kidneys and major arteries; electrocardiograph) which all returned very normal results indicating primary hypertension. While I don't love the fact that I'm in my twenties and need medication for something I've always associated with much older people; it does run in my family on both sides and I'm glad that it's currently controlled. DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM: For several weeks I had been experiencing mild; but regular; pain in my abdomen/rectal region. It was relatively dull; and thus generally difficult to pinpoint where exactly; so generalizing it as lower abdominal and rectal pain. Unfortunately over the last two weeks it seemed to progress somewhat rapidly. Included things like pain in my lower back/sides; and a constant feeling of needing to stretch (bend over at the lower back). It was worsened after lots of walking and lessened somewhat when sitting/resting. TEMPORARY RESOLUTION: I understand that this is not a good idea; but after week of feeling like a problem was escalating I went off my blood pressure medication for 4 days to see if it could have been a side affect of the drug. Within 36 hours the pain was completely gone. I immediately made an appointment with my physician; at the time feeling relieved that I had identified the problem as a simple and reversible side affect and assumed that among the plethora of hypertension treatments out there that another one would likely be better tolerated. Additionally; the Mayo Clinic lists ""abdominal or stomach pain"" and ""lower back or side pain"" under ""more common side affects on its website. (http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/losartan-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20067341) Again; I understand the implication of going off medication without seeking professional advice first; but I was traveling in another country where I do not speak the language and was unable to reach my doctor by phone. I've discussed it with him and assured him that I'll be sure to get in touch with him before ever making a similar decision. Additionally; feeling that my several day test was enough to inform my conversation with my doctor; but not wanting to continue without his advice I went back on the medication and several hours later began noticing the abdominal and side pain (back pain seems more mild; but also manifested last to begin with). That seemed pretty definitive to me that I'm just not tolerating this treatment well. FOLLOW UP: So yesterday I had my appointment with him; and was surprised by the response. He said that losartan has no interaction with the GI tract and that he things my discomfort is caused by a lumbar nerve. He ordered a lumbar spine x-ray which I have on Monday; and prescribed ibuprofen. He asked if I've had diarrhea or constipation (I haven't been tracking closely; unfortunately but I don't think so); pain in my legs; and that's it. There was also zero physical examination of my back; and limited questioning about my back symptoms before ordering the x-ray; which struck me as unusual but I made the appointment for exam and follow up for next Tuesday. I also told him that I had some concerns about the diuretic (hctz) as I already urinate frequently; and I wondered if the addition of a prescription diuretic was ""overactivating"" my kidneys in some way. He dismissed that fairly quickly; and I'm not very concerned about my kidneys after all the initial testing; but trying to include the observation in all conversation. Last night I called my mother in the US (a nurse) who ran this all by a family friend who is a physician (internal medicine) who agreed that I should stay on the losartan/hctz (although he noted that he thinks 100mg/12.5mg is very aggressive first step into treatment); but was much more curious about bowel movements and whether or not I had experienced constipation or diarrhea. NEW QUESTIONS: I suppose more than a second opinion (although appreciated); I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with abdominal pain or back/side pain while on hypertension medications? If you were able to get past them; do you feel like I've left out critical information in my conversations with my doctor? Unfortunately because my Spanish language; and his English; are somewhat limiting our ability to communicate about this to the level I'd like I have to do a lot of preparation in advance of my appointments to make sure I can describe things well. Would love any input so I can try to more effectively describe what's going on and make sure he has all the information he needs; and hopefully having me a bit less confused.

337,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have had eratic blood pressure for the last 3and 1/2 years. In 2005 I was diagnosed pre-hypertensive; my BP was 155-160 over 80-90. When I am at my Gynecoligist's office my BP is high 160/92 before the exam and then lowers after 130/80. Except this time; it was 162/99 and after went down only to 150/90. My Gyn Dr. said to monitor it for the next 2-4 weeks and if it stays above 140/80 to go to my PC physician and get on some meds. I suffer pretty bad from seasonal allergies and have been coughing and sneezing alot. I have had some quick pains in my chest (left side) but they don't last long (10 seconds or so). I have not been sleeping at nigh; partly because I am worried that I am going to 'Stroke out'. My brother is a Fitness Director/trainer and told me not to go on BP meds that they are bad for the body. Is there a pill that is either low key or 'natural' that I may be able to take? and has it been too long with this high bp?,2008,2008,,Female,i erat blood pressur last 3and 12 year in 2005 i diagnos prehypertens bp 155160 8090 when i gynecoligist offic bp high 16092 exam lower 13080 except time 16299 went 15090 my gyn dr said monitor next 24 week stay 14080 go pc physician get med i suffer pretti bad season allergi cough sneez alot i quick pain chest left side dont last long 10 second i sleep nigh part i worri i go stroke my brother fit directortrain told go bp med bad bodi is pill either low key natur i may abl take long high bp
338,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have been experiencing very bloated; swollen; painful; stiff ankles for about a year now. If my pressure goes up above 110 over 70 flat; then my ankles swell a lot; and it takes doubling up on all hypertension medications to break the cycle and come all the way down to 110 over 70 flat. But if I have to stay up late; or if I have a lot of going to do; or if I have to go up and down a lot of stairs; which happens often; or if I get stressed out for three days in a row; MY ANKLES BLOW UP AND STAY UP UNTIL I OVER MEDICATE DOUBLING UP ON ALL THREE MEDICATIONS FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

339,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I have a perplexing case study for which I have been able to offer little help to this patient. I hope there is someone out there who knows about this condition or who can direct me to someone who does. She is a 66 y.o. white female who presented with cc of; ""I've got a burning sensation on my lips. I've had it for 20 years. I have gone to many different dermatologists; physicians and ENT's who have given me some creams to put on my lips; it hasn't helped and now my entire mouth is burning."" She stated that her palate; gums; lips and tongue burned and it would come and go. It gets a little worse as the day wears on. Her latest episode of it occurred after she brushed her teeth using Sensodyne toothpaste. Clinical exam showed no obvious reddening of the soft tissue areas. Pt. is taking several medications. They include: Ativan for depression; hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for hypertension and Benazepril (ACE inhibitor for hypertension); Imipramine 50 mg for depression; and 81 mg asiprin for prophylactic arteriovascularity; and hydrocodone for back pain(2 yrs; possibly addicted to Lortab). Burning Mouth Syndrome came to mind for me as top on the differential; but what is causing it? The patient swears that it all started after she got her braces on when she was about 46. ""they poked into my lips; which created sores and they've been burning ever since."" I suggested taking her off the ACE inhibitor. They have been shown to increase the incidence of BMS. I also suggested drinking plenty of fluids and using Biotene mouthwash and toothpaste instead of the alcohol containing mouthwash that she has been using everyday. The Bioten exacerbated the burning sensation. She used it for two days and could not take the pain so she quit using it. What else can be done?

341,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I'm a 21 year old female with a BMI of 43.5 and a moderatively active lifestyle due to school/work. I walk 30 minutes every day; at a brisk pace. I have primary hypertension despite a low-sodium diet and Lisinopril (I was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide but due to my IBS-D I ended up dehydrated and requiring FRT in the ED). Due to my HR being chronically low; I'm not a good candidate for beta blockers so I'm on Lisinopril which just can't seem to manage my BP. My average resting heart rate is 48! I have a pulsation visible in 4/10 nailbeds that coincides with my heart rate; I've since learned it's called Quickne's pulse. I can't remember the last time I DIDNT have edema in my feet and legs. Some days it's worse than others; but every day it's pitting edema. I get a tightness in my chest sometimes and I can't seem to catch my breath. I'm tired all the time. I've gone to my PCP and had several several blood panels; urinalysis; etc with no conclusive results. I've gone to the ED due to the pain in my chest and inability to catch my breath and was tucked away to finish the cardiac enzyme protocol then shipped home with some Maalox as if it was some acid reflux causing my feet; hands; arms and face to swell.

342,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear Cleveland Clinic Physicians; Background: Male Age 65; high blood pressure; daily medicine doses: atenonol(50mg); vasotec(25mg); hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); imdur(30mg); lipitor(20mg); and aspirin(81mg). When I measure my blood pressure I take three consecutive measurements about 30 to 45 seconds apart. The first measurement is always highest(150/80); the second measurement(138/75); and the third measurement(125/72). What is the correct blood pressure? Is it the first measurement; the average of the three measurement; or the average of the second and third measurements? Also; I take these measurements three times a day and there is a variation. In the morning it is always highest and about an hour after dinner(6:00 PM) it is always the lowest. During the day the highest measurement may be 155/82 and the lowest measurement may be 106/60. Is it unusual for blood pressure to vary this much during the day? It seems as I am aging my systolic is beginning to creep some; however; my diastolic seems to remain normal. Is it time to tweak some of my medications to lower the systolic or should I wait to see if this continues for a few weeks? I first started noticing these changes for the last three or four days. Also; my blood pressure will be lowest about two hours after a 30 minute daily jog. Is there a blood pressure medication that would just treat the systolic and not the diastolic?

343,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I was taking Lotensin/Benazepril for a couple of hears for mild hypertension (~145/95) and it was being effective. A few months ago I started having various neurological symptoms including: 1) Numbness and tingling in my fingers and toes. 2) Needle-stick like pains in my feet. 3) Trembling of my hands; arms; and thighs. 4) Feelings like being splashed by cold water in my legs; arms; and torso. I had some tests (an MRI of the cervical spine and an EMG/NCV) for possible herniated disk. The MRI was normal and the EMG was ""inconclusive"" according to the neurologist. The connection to the benazepril didn't hit me until one day. I stopped it and over the next couple of weeks the symptoms decreased markedly but not entirely. I had an appointment with my doctor and we talked about it and he changed be to lisinopril. I took it one time and about 2-3 hours after I took it the symptoms; all of them; were back stronger than ever. Especially the trembling. It's pretty clear to me that there is a cause-effect relationship here. So it's been about 3 weeks since I took the lisinopril and I'm back to where I was before I took it. I have some symptoms; mostly the tingling and the needle-like pains. I see that some of these symptoms; while uncommon; are associated with ACE inhibitors. So my questions are do you think these problems are actually caused by the benazepril and lisinopril? If so; are is the damage they may have caused permanent or should I see improvement over time? I'm obviously very leery about trying another hypertension med. I am seeing my GP doctor in a week.

345,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My husband died on July 5 while we were at our ranch in a very remote location. He had no history of any heart disease. His mother had arythmea; which was corrected surgically approximately 2 years ago; but no other familial heart disease. He was diagnosed with borderline hypertension approximately 5 years ago; but it was under control with the use hydrochlorothiazide. On the night of the 3rd; when we went to bed; he said his legs felt weird. Not painful; but heavy or numb. The next day; the 4th of July; he said he still didn't feel great; but he felt better. We drove to our ranch; which is in a very remote location; that day and did normal activities; driving around the ranch; etc. My husband grilled burgers for dinner. He had no strenuous activities after dinner. At midnight we went to bed; but he got up after about 10 minutes because he said he didn't think he'd be able to sleep. At 3 a.m. he woke me up to tell me we needed to leave because his heart was racing. He got in the truck; and I got up; and grabbed my purse and my phone. When I got in the truck approx. 2 min. later; he had a seizure. I dialed 911; and got the county EMS; who indicated they would send an ambulance. His breathing was extremely loud - almost like barking- for approximately 2 minutes. As I was driving toward the ambulance; I could hear him breathing; but he suddenly stopped just before we reached the ambulance (about 20 minutes after he woke me up). The EMTs did not start CPR for nearly 10 minutes; and did not seem to be in any hurry to do so. They drove the ambulance directly to the JP's house; who pronounced him dead approximately 40 minutes after my husband woke me up. The JP insisted it was a heart attack; and because this county doesn't have an ME; they have to rely on another county for autopsies. I was told that they absolutely would not do an autopsy because the JP was convinced it was a heart attack. I may never know why my husband died; but I'm hoping someone can tell me if they think this sounds like a heart attack or something else. Is there any way we could have known he was in trouble?

347,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. My blood pressure before I was put on medication was averaging about 160/95 on average; sometimes going into the 190/105+ ranges. I was recently put on Hydrochlorothiazide (25mg twice a day) to lower my blood pressure. This has helped lower it to somewhat but I'm still seeing the 140/90+ ranges constantly. I have had several EGKs; everything fine; chest x-rays - fine; blood tests - all good; and several urine tests which all came back good (except 1 last test). I am constantly having chest pain and have been having it on and off for the past couple weeks. The past week it has been especially bad. It is a constant pain; sometimes dull; sometimes sharp pains like someone is stabbing me with a knife in the heart and it will radiate to my left arm. I am very easily winded; like walking up stairs will make me breath heavy and I feel exhausted. Several times my heart rate has been 110-116 resting. The last time my heart was racing I had just gotten up for bed and was getting ready for work. I hadn't done anything physical; and only had a half a glass of pop. The doctor keeps telling me everything looks fine; and for some reason whenever I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal; yesterday it was 125/75. I immediately went home and checked my blood pressure and it was 145/89ish (after 5 minutes of resting peacefully). Every time I go see him my blood pressure comes back normal yet when I go home it's high. I honestly think either his machine doesn't work properly or he's taking the reading wrong. I have a good blood pressure monitor at home; and I follow the steps exactly as the manual states. The machine is rated for clinical accuracy within 5 points and other people who have tried it come back normal. I am worried that the readings my doctor is getting aren't accurate and he doesn't think it's as bad as it is. I've told him of my chest pains; how they come and go and get worse with moving around or doing light housework; etc; yet he feels I should be working. I have an extremely high stress job; sit for extremely long periods (my shifts are 12 hours); I work 2 days; 2 nights. Should I see another doctor?

348,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Ray on June 05; 1999 at 11:49:17 Several years ago it was discovered that I have a horseshoe kidney. Each urinalysis for the past 10 years has indicated blood in my urine. Is this to be expected with this congential condition? Also; recently; I had a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with Bactrim DS. This is the first infection I have had in ten years. One additional question; will diuretics such as Bumetanide or Hydrochlorothiazide have a harmful effect with horseshoe kidney? Is a calcium channel blocker; such as Verapamil; acceptable for hypertension with horseshoe kidney?

349,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Hi I am new to this forum. I am 46 years old 5'4"" and weigh 305 pounds. In the last six months I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure; high cholestrol; type II diabetis. I have horrible osteoarthritis in both knees and am currently receiving a series of shots in my knees. I have degenerative disc disease and herniated disc L-4 and L-5. I have horrible pain in my left outer thigh. It is sporadic; but when it happens all I can do is scream!!! It feels like fireworks on going off. If anyone know what that is or has any advice please let me know. My doc put me on gabapentin and said it is neuropothy; it has not helped at all. The last several months my feet and ankles swell to the point I can't walk! By the way I can only stand for a very short time; like 20 or 30 seconds without having to lean againt something or sit down.I have been fighting with my insurance company Health Alliance HMO to have Lap Band Surgery! They keep denying me due to my hypothyroidism. They insist my thyroid needs to in the normal range for a minimum of six months. I am on 200 mcg of Synthroid and it is still not normal. My endo stated that should not stop my surgery! I will die without it! If anyone can help with any advice I would appreciate it greatly! My husband passed away from pancratic cancer in 2005. Therefore; it is me and my wonderful sixteen year old daughter! If something happens to me she has no one. My mother died in 1999 and my father died last year. I am an only chlild and so was her father. Here is a list of my meds: Synthroid 200 mcg; methadone 60mg; lipitor 10mg; celexa 50mg; hydrochlorothiazide 50ng per day; metformin 500mg; didrex 50mg 3xday.

351,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello my name is Dale. I am 23 years old and since the age of early 21 I developed a very odd case of hypertension. Whereas my old blood pressures where in the 120/75 range suddenly I developed 160/90 blood pressure. Since then things have really gone downhill. I have developed pretty severe anxiety and basically dropped out of school about 1 1/2 years ago. That's not the worst; I have been dealing with severe heart palpitations and heart flutters in the last year; and about 3 months ago I suddenly developed shortness of breath that has stuck with me to this day. I was exercising pretty regularly up until this shortness of breath started and had actually managed to lose some weight; however since the shortness of breath started it has become nearly impossible; although I still manage to ride my bike even with the shortness of breath. Recently I consulted a Doctor of Osteopathy who performed some saliva tests on me and they showed that my cortisol levels were pretty elevated; im not sure if this consitutes Cushings but was wondering if you guys could comment. Also I should add that even on 3! Count it 3! Blood pressure medications Toprol XL 25; Losartan Potassium 100mg; Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg I am still averaging high blood pressure readings 140-150/80 . When I went to the hospital with the shortness of breath it had climbed to 190/100 and at that time I was on only the HCTZ and the Toprol. So my cortisol Morning- 8.7 Midday-8.2 Evening-6.4 Night-4.3 Reference Ranges are supposed to be Morning- 2.0-10 Midday- 3.0-6.0 Evening- 2.0-4.0 Night- <1.5 Also my DHEA is elevated slightly at 671.1; supposed to be under 644. So I guess my main symptoms are 1. Shortness of Breath 2. High Blood Pressure 3. Heart Palpitations; flutters. 4.

353,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,History: 43 year old male w/ history of anxiety and panic disorder. These emotional disorders were in remission until a flare-up last August. At that time; I began psychiatric treatment with cognitive therapy; along w/ Klonopin .25 mg X 2; and Zoloft 25 mg. X 1. (I am still on this treatment; and the anxiety and panic is well under control.) Last August; during the height of my panic; my BP was at 150/95 and heart rate at 100. My cardiologist was convinced this was due to my emotional state; and said once my anxiety is under control; my BP will subside also. (I always had good BP and low HR in the 60's.) Cardiologist prescribed Toprol XL 25 Mg a day; and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day.....Now; with my anxiety under control I am getting morning readings of 115/70 with a HR of 56; and evening BP of 106/60 with HR as low as 49. My questions: 1) Is a HR that low dangerous? I'm feeling fine-perhaps a little more tired than before; but no fainting spells. 2) I see my cardio in November; and I'm sure he is going to take me off the meds.....Is there a weaning process involved ? 3) Can uncontrolled Anxiety really cause HBP?

354,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted By Maria on September 11; 1998 at 09:39:36: Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better.

355,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"For The Past 3 1/2 years I've been having similar symptoms and every time I go to the emergency room; no one knows what to do and they basically humilate me in their doctors notes because of recreational drugs detected in my blood at the time; but no longer. (I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the ""world famous"" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it ""stabs and jabs""; another doctor called it ""electrical discharge headaches""; another doctor called it ""cluster headaches"". A previous doctor prescribed ""indomethecin""; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide. I smoke between 8 to 10 cigarettes a day and I've always loved life to the fullest however; whatever this disease is; It's so debilitating until I've even attempted suicide. The pain is far beyond what any human should have to endure. .",2012,2012,49.0,Male,for the past 3 12 year ive similar symptom everi time i go emerg room one know basic humil doctor note recreat drug detect blood time longer im total sober i excruci stab jolt pain feel though someon insid head hammer spike hammer sync beat heart i 1 4 strike within 4 5 second period if blood pressur high slight movement trigger strike if i think someth make angri instant strike occur each excruci strike send numb shock whole bodi higher diastol number intens strike pain strike if doctor shine littl red color light eye check pupil dialat i get immedi sever unbar strike go convuls violent uncontrol disturb bodi my entir bodi jolt beat headach strike the strike bad stop track im forc ground im 49 year old male i truck accid 05 3 epidur 1 lamenectomi diskectomi 08 leav disk deteri expand scar tissu l3 l4 along radiculopathi run left leg i also 5mm herniat l5 s1 i went world famous cleveland clinic seen neurologist dr stewart tepper i offic everi bit 3 minut said take mani percoset sent detox well 2 year ago i stop take percoset still diseas so much percoset caus one doctor call stab jab anoth doctor call electr discharg headach anoth doctor call cluster headach a previous doctor prescrib indomethecin howev dr stewart tepper said stop take along percoset if i keep blood pressur control i intermitt numb shock head bodi pain i current take clonidin hypertens along propanolol amlodipinewhich absolut noth hypertens hydrochlorothiazid i smoke 8 10 cigarett day ive alway love life fullest howev whatev diseas it debilit ive even attempt suicid the pain far beyond human endur
356,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I recently underwent a series of test: echo; ekg; stress test; and heart cath. My doctor said I have dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40% and left bundle branch block. I have been receiving treatment for high blood pressure for several months. I am currently taking atacand 16mg twice a day; clonidine .2mg three times a day; hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day; norvasc 5 mg once a day; and K-DUR. My blood pressure is still not under control. My question is how much relation is there to the cardiomyopathy and my blood pressure? If my blood pressure is ever under control will the cardiomyopathy improve? What are the risks that the cardiomyopathy will worsen? Is it normal for blood pressure to be so resistant to mediciation? There are others we have tried (lopressor; cardizem; to name a few) with no results. I am 53woman and slightly overweight. My doctor says my blood work looks like a 20 year old (no problems).

357,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,My mom was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia approx. 17 years ago. Priror to this she worked as a social worker and after she had me she retired and ran her own daycare out of our house. She seemed fine with it at this time although there may have been small hints of something not right in stories she told the relatives. She's currently 59 years old and in addition to schizophrenia she also has stage II hypertension; chronic headaches; a severe skin rash that leaves open sores over her body (especially when scratched) and sometimes her mouth will twitch to the side (kind of like bells palsy but it comes and goes). Since I was a child when she first developed most of these symptoms I can't recall the exact order in which they occured however I have included them here because I beleive they may be somehow related. She's currently on hydrochlorothiazide and propanalol to control her headaches and hypertension. I'm wondering if one of these medications could also be causing her rash. Her schizophrenia symptomps display as paranoid thoughts beleiving she is being spied upon by 'the neighborhood'; especially the police; school teachers and the liquor store people. She has extreamly poor hygine; rarely baths and goes months without doing the dishes or cleaning up making her house smell really badly. She can become extreamly abusive especially when confronted and asked to acknoledge her problems. When I was a child I remember her occasionally telling odd stories to the relatives however she seemed much better able to take care of herself. Her hygine was much better; she drove longer distances; etc. When she was first diagnosed we brought her to UCLA medical center because she would randomly walk into the neighborhood and keep walking with no where to go. She was treated there for a while and seemed to get better and sent home with medication (although I can not remember which medication it was). Sometime after this I found her lying in bed; slurring her words and cussing really fowl things I had never heard her say before; swearing over and over again. She had taken many boddles of her medicine (I think it may have been hadol or another drug in it's class at that time (approx. 1985). I called the paramedics and they rushed her to the hospital and gave her charchol to neutrialize it. I believe that her overdose may have made her illness much worse. I do not remember her being so absuive before this point; and now she routinely swears and curses at everything. Also afterwards is when I beleive she developed her facial twich and she used to sit in the car stare into nowhere and roll her fingers together. She wasn't on the anti-psychotics for long but could the overdose have given her tardive dyskenia or caused her to be that much more absusive? Is there anything I can do to help her now?,2003,2003,,,my mom diagnos paranoid schizophrenia approx 17 year ago priror work social worker retir ran daycar hous she seem fine time although may small hint someth right stori told relat shes current 59 year old addit schizophrenia also stage ii hypertens chronic headach sever skin rash leav open sore bodi especi scratch sometim mouth twitch side kind like bell palsi come goe sinc i child first develop symptom i cant recal exact order occur howev i includ i beleiv may somehow relat shes current hydrochlorothiazid propanalol control headach hypertens im wonder one medic could also caus rash her schizophrenia symptomp display paranoid thought beleiv spi upon neighborhood especi polic school teacher liquor store peopl she extream poor hygin rare bath goe month without dish clean make hous smell realli bad she becom extream abus especi confront ask acknoledg problem when i child i rememb occasion tell odd stori relat howev seem much better abl take care her hygin much better drove longer distanc etc when first diagnos brought ucla medic center would random walk neighborhood keep walk go she treat seem get better sent home medic although i rememb medic sometim i found lie bed slur word cuss realli fowl thing i never heard say swear she taken mani boddl medicin i think may hadol anoth drug class time approx 1985 i call paramed rush hospit gave charchol neutrial i believ overdos may made ill much wors i rememb absuiv point routin swear curs everyth also afterward i beleiv develop facial twich use sit car stare nowher roll finger togeth she wasnt antipsychot long could overdos given tardiv dyskenia caus much absus is anyth i help

359,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I'm a 41 yr old female; 5'3""; 130lbs and recently had a abnormal echo stress test. I then had a left catherization done and was diagnosed with ""hypertensive heart disease with diastolic dysfunction"". I am on Lisinopril/Hydrochlorothiazide meds of which I take 1/2 tablet of a 12.5 mg tablet daily. My cardiologist stated that the diastolic dysfunction is caused by untreated high blood pressure; but I've been on blood pressure meds (hydrochloritiazide) for over 3 years prior to getting this latest diagnosis. My question is whether or not there are any other possible causes of diastolic dysfunction. I've had other symptoms over the last few years (fatigue; weakness/loss of strength; numbness in hands/feet; dizziness; foggy memory; slight carpal tunnel in both wrists per EMG test) and have undergone a few tests (checking for Rheumatoid Arth.; Lupus; EMG test) all of which came back normal. My blood pressure has always been low; in fact too low (81/48 lately) since I've been on the blood pressure meds. I'm just trying to find out if there may be another root cause of why I'm not feeling well.

360,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life.

361,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Posted by Ray on June 05; 1999 at 11:49:17 Several years ago it was discovered that I have a horseshoe kidney. Each urinalysis for the past 10 years has indicated blood in my urine. Is this to be expected with this congential condition? Also; recently; I had a urinary tract infection that was successfully treated with Bactrim DS. This is the first infection I have had in ten years. One additional question; will diuretics such as Bumetanide or Hydrochlorothiazide have a harmful effect with horseshoe kidney? Is a calcium channel blocker; such as Verapamil; acceptable for hypertension with horseshoe kidney? Posted by HFHS M.D.-CK on June 08; 1999 at 12:47:58 Dear Ray; Horseshoe kidney is a common anomaly with about 1/400 being affected. It is more common in males. Horseshoe kidneys are fused together across the midline. Horseshoe kidneys may be associated with skeletal; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal ; or genitourinary abnormalities as well. One third of patients remain entirely asymptomatic. When symptoms are present; hematuria; stones; infection; and blockage of urine flow are seen. Vesicoureteral reflux and an increased incidence of urologic cancers has been reported. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil are acceptable to use with a horseshoe kidney. This information is provided for general medical information purposes only. Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition. More individualized care is available through our department at the Henry Ford Hospital and its suburban locations (I-800-653-6568).

363,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"64 years old; 6' 2""; 210 pounds; retired; work out daily at a gym. History of high cholesterol. I had a heart attack five years ago. A recent stress test concluded I needed an Angiogram; which lead to two stents installed. The Operative report included: 1. Unremarkable left main. 2. Anterior descending demonstrating two areas of excentric plaque treated with 4 x 12 and 2.5 x 8 stents; with excellent results. This is the area of ischemia on his receont isotope stress. 3. Circumflex free of disease. 4. Dominant right coronary demonstrates multiple areas of non-critical stenosis with intercurrent thrombus. This area was not approached at this time. Inferior wall demonstated scar with no reversibility on his recent isotope stress. 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction 48% with some inferior wall hypokinesis. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 38 pre-; 30 post-left ventiriculogram. I am taking Plavix; Coreg; Aspirin and Vytorin. My questions: l. Since the stents were installed two months ago; I run out of breath and tire rather quickly when exercising or climbing stairs. Does the stenting procedure itself require a healing period; during which time the heart isn't working as well as it could? 2. I'm curious what the left ventricular end diastolic pressure readings indicate. 3. I am having severe muscle spasms in my back; particularly at night; and haven't done anything to aggravate the muscles. I read that Vytorin can cause muscle soreness; but could it also cause muscle cramping?

365,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Thanks for taking my ?? I had an echo done nearly 5 years ago ; it showed only borderline hypertrophy; I had a echo done this past Tuesday which the cardio said had progressed from borderline to mild; a change of about 2mm if I remember correctly; B/P was 140/85 in the doc's office; at home every time I take it is always control around 115/70 most of the time. He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate.

Renal clearance/labs wnl. Cholesterol ~220. (Hx recurrent UTI's once a year over 10yr period; culminated in passing of ""grit"" with ultrasound showing renal ?pyramids? and mildly fatty liver. UTI's never recurred after ""grit"" episode. Ouch.) age 40; heart ct for a study showed arteriosclerosis-80% of my age group better than I. age ~41; allergies started after severe exposure to kitty litter dust and a throat sinus ear infection that went untreated too long.

Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; ""crossed the border to mild asthma"" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the ""stroke."" I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My ""chart"" is 1/2"" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead. I do not agree with the hormone therapy for menopausal women-but I know it offers some cardiovascular protection? Here comes the wacko question-is anyone in the medical field currently prescribing bloodletting for menopausal women?

368,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

370,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 56 years old with a family history of heart disease; hypertension and diabetes. I have had high blood pressure; semi controlled; for 10 years. I have smoked occasionally for a total of 5 years (maybe 1 pack per month; if you combine it all together. I am not smoking now. I have been having extremely short duration stabbing pain (as if with a needle) on the left side of my chest and on the left forearm. The duration lasts maybe a millisecond.

371,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hi ; I am a long time member of this forum. On 2008 I finished 1 year Interferon + Ribavirin tx. Since then I feel very well; beside that the liver disease left me with mild Rosacea. About 3 years I started to have mild Hypertension and I decided to take meds - Co-Diovan (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE / VALSARTAN) since then. The blood-pressure was not high but I decided to take meds rather then do jogging every day. Only recently I notices that Urea (B) and Uric-Acid cam above normal right after I started with Co-Diovan. I also started 2 years ago with Avodart and Xatral against slightly enlarged prostate. Recently I had pain in the Thumb toe. family doc gave me diet against Gout. Also I did X-ray for a periodical checkup and the doctor (another doctor) now suspect that I maybe have Ankylosing spondylitis. I am worried. Tomorrow I will make some blood-tests. I would be happy for information. Are there any now relationships between those diseases and HCV or Interferon or the hyper-tension meds that I am taking ? I would be happy for any good information. Thank you; Jack,2007,2017,,Male,hi i long time member forum on 2008 i finish 1 year interferon ribavirin tx sinc i feel well besid liver diseas left mild rosacea about 3 year i start mild hypertens i decid take med codiovan hydrochlorothiazid valsartan sinc the bloodpressur high i decid take med rather jog everi day onli recent i notic urea b uricacid cam normal right i start codiovan i also start 2 year ago avodart xatral slight enlarg prostat recent i pain thumb toe famili doc gave diet gout also i xray period checkup doctor anoth doctor suspect i mayb ankylos spondyl i worri tomorrow i make bloodtest i would happi inform are relationship diseas hcv interferon hypertens med i take i would happi good inform thank jack
372,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am a 44 year old male; non-smoker; currently on the following meds: Toprol XL 25 mgs and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mgs for anxiety-produced hypertension; along with Klonopin 0.25 mgs and Zoloft 25 mgs for Anxiety and Panic Disorder. I have been on these meds for 1 year with good results. I have always had good lipid readings; however; since beginning these meds; it appears that my lipids have risen. My recent test are: TC-220 HDL-56 LDL(calculated)-113 TRIG-253 CHOL/HDL ratio-3.9 My questions are: (1) Am I a candidate for Statin therapy? (2) Can the LDL be accurate; being that it was calculated with a TG level of 253? (3) Can the current meds I am on raise lipids? (4) As an aside; concerning APO B/A1 ratio; seven years ago I had mine measured and it was 0.82; with A1 being 146; and B being 120....Are these safe numbers?

373,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type ""A"" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise. Would this be enough or is medicine the only way to go? thanks for all your time and help",2006,2006,,,hi im 40 year old male 6ft 210 lbs i recent heart ultrasound check free health screen everyth blood flow volum aaa screen fine no sign plaqu anyth i told i iv measur 14 high i assum 14 mean 14 cm diamet i told i discuss doctor next visit i ask i high bp ill admit i type a bp run borderlin i abl bring last year ten fifteen year ago ran 140150mid 90s last year 120130mid 80s i refus medic except daili dose hctz id like control lifestyl adjust i also use fair share weightlift 20 year ago this first heart screen i baselin go it free screen i assum may fair variat rate well my bp littl high screen i dont know consid well q could tell would consid normal iv bad read im truli 14 is histori borderlin high bp like caus can number vari day day can reducedimprov what best way improv i could stand lose lbs better cardio exercis would enough medicin way go thank time help
374,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"hi. I am a 21 year old male who is 5'9"" and weighs 160lbs. I NEVER smoke or drink caffeine; and I run four sessions of 3 miles/22 min. of cardio each week. I limit drinking to the weekends (and even then it's minimal); and I do not exceed 1500mg of sodium content daily. I consider myself very healthy and have never had health issues; surgery; or been on meds. nothing at all until now - just out of nowhere. about three weeks ago I had a terrible upper respiratory infection; which sent me to the doctor. he took my BP there and was shocked to learn it was in the 190/105 range; so he ran an EKG and breathing test and both were fine. to be cautious he sent me to the ER; where they performed a urinalysis and another EKG. both were fine. keep in mind; by the time I got to the hospital (10 min later); my BP was down to 156/94 or so. went back to the doctor a week or so later and my BP was still in the high range - now 170/95 or so. he wanted me to go to the ER again; but I refused - saying I prefer taking care of it there since I can't afford to pay $3000 again (I have bad insurance) for the ER. he said fine and prescribed me 5mg of lisinopril and told me to buy a home blood pressure monitoring machine. I have been taking lisinopril and using the monitoring machine I bought (Omron HEM-790IT) for about two weeks now. BP was high at the beginning; but the past week or so has gotten quite better. in the mornings and at night it is around 125/80; and when I return from school/work it is at the most 140/90. I understand the latter number is no good; but I figured it wasn't anything severe enough that an even better diet couldn't change. but again. my diet is already pretty good now here's the odd part: after a week or so of these readings being between 125-140; I went to the doctor's for the first time in two weeks expecting at least SOME improvement. after all; I have been eating extremely healthy; drinking tons of water; and taking lisinopril - in addition to the fact my home BP machine shows readings that are just pre-hypertension or barely stage 1. but when he took my BP; it was STILL in the 170s. I was shocked and he just let out a sigh of disappointment. he prescribed me hydrochlorothiazide to take along with lisinopril; and told me to come back tomorrow after taking a dose of both tonight and tomorrow. he also told me to bring my BP machine; just to compare readings. now; I know what white coat hypertension is; but I thought it only allowed your BP to raise maybe 10 points above normal. I certainly did not anticipate a growth in 30-40 points! I am extremely stressed about this situation... I'm only 21 years old; work out a lot; eat healthy; don't smoke... why is this happening to me? I initially thought it was just due to my respiratory infection; but that has been gone for almost 2 weeks and my high BP is still present. I'm a college student so I am somewhat stressed; but nothing too severe. I feel fine - never any headaches; aches; or anything like that. the only thing that's stressing me out right now is this darn BP. it just seems like I can't do anything... I eat healthy; do everything right; but still... I don't want to be on meds forever it would at least help if the meds were working when I went to the doctor's... any thoughts or suggestions? I have a lot of stress and anxiety BECAUSE of my BP situation; which just makes it worse. I really value my life and will do anything to remain healthy. it's just seems that I can't to do anything to combat this! :(",2011,2011,,Male,hi i 21 year old male 59 weigh 160lbs i never smoke drink caffein i run four session 3 miles22 min cardio week i limit drink weekend even minim i exceed 1500mg sodium content daili i consid healthi never health issu surgeri med noth nowher three week ago i terribl upper respiratori infect sent doctor took bp shock learn 190105 rang ran ekg breath test fine cautious sent er perform urinalysi anoth ekg fine keep mind time i got hospit 10 min later bp 15694 went back doctor week later bp still high rang 17095 want go er i refus say i prefer take care sinc i cant afford pay 3000 i bad insur er said fine prescrib 5mg lisinopril told buy home blood pressur monitor machin i take lisinopril use monitor machin i bought omron hem790it two week bp high begin past week gotten quit better morn night around 12580 i return schoolwork 14090 i understand latter number good i figur wasnt anyth sever enough even better diet couldnt chang diet alreadi pretti good here odd part week read 125140 i went doctor first time two week expect least some improv i eat extrem healthi drink ton water take lisinopril addit fact home bp machin show read prehypertens bare stage 1 took bp still 170s i shock let sigh disappoint prescrib hydrochlorothiazid take along lisinopril told come back tomorrow take dose tonight tomorrow also told bring bp machin compar read i know white coat hypertens i thought allow bp rais mayb 10 point normal i certain anticip growth 3040 point i extrem stress situat im 21 year old work lot eat healthi dont smoke happen i initi thought due respiratori infect gone almost 2 week high bp still present im colleg student i somewhat stress noth sever i feel fine never headach ach anyth like thing that stress right darn bp seem like i cant anyth i eat healthi everyth right still i dont want med forev would least help med work i went doctor thought suggest i lot stress anxieti becaus bp situat make wors i realli valu life anyth remain healthi seem i cant anyth combat
375,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I've had Progressive M S for over 4 years now. I seriously thougth I had dealt with all those issues faily well till WAM! In Feb this year I began having seizures! Big ones; little ones; jelly bean jumping full seziures. Treatment was MASSIVE intravenous bags of Steriods.? By May they had all stopped thank you God! But the results from the steriods was extreme! I had gained over 25 lbs! In less than 4 months! In the past week my insurance had changed manufacturers and my medication for Hypertension; TrianterenW/hctz 37.5/25 ""CAPSULE""; was replaced with a ""TABLET""! On them for about 12 days and I noticed my feet are swelling more and more and more and still swelling! From both legs starting at the kneecap-all the way down to the almost hidden toes. And walking is excruciating! I elevate; drink lots of water (admittedly not every day prior to this time)-cause I am a Diet-Pepsi 'aholic..lol Of course I called the mail order company and they said-sorry your insurance changed in june and now we use Mfg. Sandoz. No replacement possible. I tried using my mom's (i know I know-but it was my old kind); just until I can see my Dr. Nothing!...I even drank water like crazy! My daughter is a Paramedic so when i told her of the problem she asked me to push down on the ankle area and tell her what I saw. I said the dent is still there! It won't re-inflate; so to speak. What does that mean? She said are you having trouble breathing? I said no. She said Physicians diagnose patients by a level of this method; and call the Dr. asap for a visit. Thats 2 days away and now I am a little freightened. I have tried ice; elevation; water and nothing makes it go down. I even wake to the swelling! She asked if I had injured my leg or back at some point recently? The only thing that comes to mind is last week my knee tried to keep giving out on me and had a hard throb to it. I put ice on kept it up and went on with my life. Nothing is changing it. Any ideas about this and has anyone else been through this? Is it M S related?

376,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was ""a little off"" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested?

377,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I went to get my first B12 injection the other day and I was shocked that the doctor didn't put on gloves to give the injection. Is this common? Also; they prescribed phentermine (30mg) and the water pill triamterene/hydrodcholrothiazide (75 mg). Since I have high blood pressure; I really want to avoid taking the phentermine since it elevates your heart rate. Has anyone used just the water pill and B12 (along with sensible diet and exercise; of course) with success or is the majority of weight loss help from the phentermine? Finally; has anyone in Los Angeles used the services at Westchester Wellness & Weight Loss? They're nearby and I was thinking about trying them...

379,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor. Can anyone give me suggestions I'm to young and on to many pills and refuse to be disabled but it looks like that's not gonna be my choice if something doesn't change soon; thanks.,2016,2016,,Female,i 30 year old male i guess ill start begin i rememb when i 8 i diagnos osgood slaughter diseas start bad arthriti knee made difficult play play sport i still throughout childhood i alway felt tire sluggish energi drive mild hypertens i alway slight averag size weight muscular i also suffer stomach issu throughout childhood lot diarrhea constip never regular in 2008 i ruptur larg intestin told multipl doctor gas i went eras ct scan near week pass i extrem amount infect cut open remov lot small larg intestin bad clean infect multipl organ they diagnos diverticul i mani antibiot time in 2012 start multipl high blood attack i would taken error bp around 220 150 they start hydrochlorothiazid didnt work ad benazepril amlodipin help littl bit work way back then ad prozac buspiron xanax need found lot blood pressur attack anxieti in 2014 i sever pain feet found i larg heel spur feet in 2015 march ear ach side head swell colliflow ear alway problem antibiot work start augmentin didnt work put ciprofloxacin doctor often thing work infect 3 week antibiot i also end bad yeast infect everytim take antibiot in juli i anoth issu intestin diagnos crohn hospit day bad crohn attack fill antibiot gastrointestin doctor start prednison i took month till around septemb had worst withdraw symptom i crawl step took ween a week i prednison i start bad lower back pain my doctor gave flexeril didnt work pain got wors next month in januari 2016 i i could work sleep sit without extrem pain i mri done i 10 bulg disc 5 herniat in mid lower back multipl bone spur vertebra worn size i first 3 steroid epidur shot februari work week never pain spread area pain worsen i also bone spur mani joint hip shoulder finger the past month felt like someth eat bodi insid im extrem pain get wors night take forev get go morn whenev i take break pain med dont work i take nsaid stomach bleed tri nerv pain pill im allerg i feel like someth caus doctor cant figur health fall rapid pace im still work hard past day feel like hip fall place i read candida wonder bring doctor can anyon give suggest im young mani pill refus disabl look like that gon na choic someth doesnt chang soon thank
380,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,It appears that any significant amount of protein in any form creates several painful and uncomfortable side effects in my body when consumed. This includes meat; eggs; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. For example; if I consume eggs then I get persistent headaches; brain fog; heart pain; increased blood pressure (I’ve had spikes to 165/105); numb and prickly skin; stiff neck muscles/tension; a burning pain in my kidneys; a changed sense of smell (I start smelling a particular thing that isn’t there and/or my skin is creating some kind of specific smell); and in general I just feel like I’ve been poisoned. Any form of exercise increases the severity of the side effects and causes additional pain. Eggs and seafood appear to create the worst side effects; but I get the same or similar symptoms to a lesser extent when eating other types of meat; dairy; soy; beans; and nuts. This has lead me to start eating a heavily non-protein rich vegetable and fruit based diet; and has helped my side effects and blood pressure significantly; but this means I have to avoid almost all “normal” food. Does anybody have any clue what might be wrong? I have asked my kidney doctor; but he doesn’t even make an attempt at explaining to me what might be the problem. I have listed a bunch of medical information and history below in case it is helpful. Any ideas at all are appreciated.

385,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Thank you for your advice on the hydrochlorothiazide. I saw my doctor yesterday and he rather I stay on it for now as long as I can tolerate the rash and itching. He did up my dosage of zestril to 40 mg daily (was taking 20mg daily) and keep my tenormin at 100 mg daily. He wants to see me in 2 months. If my high blood pressure is still running high then he will see about changing my meds. My heart and kidneys are good but my cholestrol is slightly high. I have been on hypertension meds for about 8 years (I'm 38 now; hispanic; slightly overweight; have GERD with hiatal hernia) and was wondering will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? Will there ever be a right combination to treat this condition? My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? I just hope I can somehow control my high blood pressure better. Thank you for your help and I am grateful for this forum. Dear Maria; Topic Area: Hypertension High blood pressure; or hypertension ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease. Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active - exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. Q: How does medicine help control high blood pressure? A: For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Q: Will I have to take meds for my hypertension the rest of my life? A: Generally; someone with high blood pressure will be on lifelong medication. Q: At what point do I need to see a heart specialist for this condition? A: Usually hypertension can be managed by a Internal Medicine doctor. Q: Will there ever be a right combination (of medication) to treat this condition? A: It may take several trials to find the right combination of drugs. There are many different medications and new ones are coming out each year. Q: My parents both had heart attacks and strokes and father had a bypass in Sept. 97 (age 74); mom had her stroke at age 49. They still take meds for hypertension. With this history is there a possibility I might have a heart attack in my later years? A: Heart disease tends to run in families. Those who have a family history of heart problems shoud take extra care of themselves (i.e. weight loss; high blood pressure control; exercise; etc.). Q: Is 250 BP reading Max (85%) on this treadmill a bad reading warranting the patient on BP meds the rest of one's life? A: Not necessarily. But this is an abnormal result and is weighed into the decision to recommend starting medication. Q: Does readings like I indicated above warrant BP medication...Did the 130/80 at the start of this Thallium Test mean that this number is ""not Normal"" either ? A: Normal BP is 120/80 or less. Blood pressures above 140/90 generally warrant starting medications. If the BP is controlled with life style changes and weight loss it may be possible to stop medications.

386,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Several months ago; I wrote to you about some studies' that show Fish Oil Supplementation has a tendancy to INCREASE LDL. Well; apparently; that seems to hold true; at least in my case. Before Fish Oil my lipids were: TC-180 and Direct LDL-87. Only 6 months later; without a dietary change; my lipids went to TC-235 and direct LDL of 150. Tri's remained boderline high at 170-200. My cardiologist is having my blood retested this week; as he thinks a lab error occured. (1) Is it possible in 6 months for a TC and LDL to Increase that much without significant dietary change? (2) Are Lab Errors Common? (3) The only other medication I added between tests were Zoloft; hydrochlorothiaizide and Toprol XL-Would any of those have a lipid effect?

389,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"PART 1 My non medical opinion. Highly technical discussion of MELDNa calculators vs MELD of Na factor. I kindly suggest that you do not read further especially if you easily get frightened about test results. This is about various ways of MELD scoring including Na factor and where it might apply. It could cause unnecessary fear; be incorrect and/or not apply to your specific situation. These scores can only be evaluated by a hepatoligist or an gastroenterologist experienced in HCV; hepatology and Cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate or severe hepatic impairment; CTP class B or C) should be referred to a medical practitioner with expertise in that condition (ideally in a liver transplant center). (DISCLAIMER) All comments by myself or other members are our own opinions and do not imply professional medical advice. Direct quotes with links provided should be source evaluated. My suggested non exclusive criteria include: 1. Professional medical opinion or another non -medical opinion. 2. Is the Professional medical opinion based on 1 or more doctors; the degree of opposing opinions and general consensus. 3. The strength of the supporting facts of the opinion such as case studies; Clinical Trial Phase; Type and numbers I respectively ask that before commenting that you read this entire text and links if needed. Familiarize yourself with a limited basic idea of the discussion and not go too far off topic. __________________________________________________________________________ Introduction I created this discussion based on my observation of the MELD-Na calculator when entering my sodium blood serum results after 1 week of treatment. I guess i have developed a ""hobby"" of playing with them to see various outcomes suggested. Background technical information if needed _____________________________________________________________________________ http://hepatitisc.uw.edu/browse/all/core-concepts 2.4 Evaluation an d Staging of Liver Fibrosis 2.5 Evaluation and Prognosis of Patients with Cirrhosis Importance of Distinguishing Compensated versus Decompensated Cirrhosis: Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score (CTP): Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) (especially have a layman's understanding) History and Background Used to predict what patients should be listed and in what order for liver transplant. The higher the MELD score; the lower the 3-month survival Calculation of MELD Score Limitations Clinical Use NOTE: Some of the core concepts have been updated at different times and may not reflect the current situation. __________________________________________________________________________________ The Meld calculators The Meld calculators can be varied updated and may have have different additional criteria including Na results and/or other including algorithms. http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/model-end-stage-liver-disease The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. Mayo Clinic researchers published the original MELD model in 2001. Refinements have been developed since then. These models are for use by medical professionals. The MELD Model The MELD-Na Model The MELD Model; UNOS modification There are more but mainly looking at MELD vs MELD-Na Model Another hosted by The Bologna Liver Oncology Group (BLOG) University of Bologna - ITALY in italian but can be google translated but you should be able to guess what input is needed. This auto show the results for different MELD calculators all at once. http://www.livercancer.eu/calculators.html NOTE this show two including Na with different results and have been unable to find out much yet about the differences One other one http://gihep.com/calculators/hepatology/meld-na/ _______________________________________________________________________________ Discussion with my guesses included and/or lack of specific knowledge unless confirmed by medical source. 1. The basic and updated MELD calculators use On Dialysis :Yes/No ; Minimum values must be 1 Creatinine 1.0 or less mg/dL is 1;0 Total Bilirubin :1 or less mg/dL is 1.0 INR 1.0 or less ratio is 1.0 because figures less than 1.0 because the natural logarithm of 1 is 0 and a value less than 1 would yield a negative value. The INR is the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample; raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical system used. No units are used 2. The lowest possible score is 6 usually mean just over 1% chance of dying in the next 3 months. So who does this apply to with HCV? a) Not to those with confirmed F2\F3 or lower without any reason or test to confirm F4? b) MELD would apply to F4 Class B or C c) What about F3/F4 well compensated? The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically. and Ascites Grade 1: mild; only visible on ultrasound and CT it is possible to miss these. Either a less recent test; a doctor without the treatment experience/knowledge of cirrhosis/hepatology and/or a patient not mentioning very mild symptoms that seem chronic (don't want to be seen as weak or a complainer) could be reasons. 3.

390,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"I am praying that someone will be able to help me. I am a 32 year old female that was diagnosed with Type diabetes at age 15. I have been on insulin from then and for the last 4 or 5 years I have been on a pump. My HBA1C Levels have been good so I have no issues with my diabetes as far as I am concerned. I was diagnosed with Poly CysticOvarian Syndrome...I have never had normal periods and I have always had to deal with acne. In order to conceive my first two kids I did like 5 cycles of Clomid with each. All pregnancy's were normal. About 5 years ago; I just started with shortness of breath. It felt as though an elephant was sitting on my chest and I couldn't get the deep breath in. In order to get a deep breath in I would have to try and force a yawn and after several attempts at forcing the yawn I might get lucky as to drawing the breath in. I have been to the emergency room on numerous occasions and because my pulse ox was always 99 they would basically dismiss me. I also have most relief lying flat on my back with my arms extended so I feel like I am opening up my rib cage. When I lay on my side I can barely breathe because it is like my rib cage is collapsing and can't expand to get air in. They have tried me on advair or singular and stuff like that because they said I have asthma (diagnosis which I still don't believe) but it doesn't work or help me out. I was referred to the cardiologist and was told I have Mitrial Valve Prolapse...(Which till today I still don't believe that diagnosis) and was put on lopressa but the medication would drop my blood pressure so low that I couldn't stand up. So that medication was stopped. After that they told me I was mental and had anxiety (zoloft; adavant and the one people always get high on); in which I think they told me that because they didn't know what was going on. I am always tired and the things I use to do its kinda hard to do them anymore because I just have no drive; stamina or energy to follow through. The only other medicine I was on in addition to my insulin was the birth control pills and my doc decided that I should stop them; but I got pregnant that very month...considering I had PolyCysticOvarianSyndrome and paid to have my first two kids; I guess that was a blessing. I had another baby and she just turned 2. I am now on Mirena which is a kind of IUD. My hair is also brittle and combs out no matter how much I do treatments for it. Over the last few months I have started with balance problems in addition to the shortness of breath. What would happen is when I get up I would have the ""almost"" blackout effect as I would call it; its like I am so disoriented that I just have to hold on; it is not the roller coaster feeling that comes with vertigo but it lasts for about 30-40 seconds and I just have to catch myself so I don't fall. This has started happening more frequently; when I bend down to wash my face and get back up or bending over to brush my teeth or even just closing my eyes; I sway all over the place. Its like shutting off an electrical breaker and cutting it back on quickly; so there is like a glitch in the system which cause just a temporary loss of power and then it resumes where it left off. I also get the dots of flashing lights when this happens and it honestly is just a bad feeling of the constant rocking and swaying motion. I went to my doc for my pap smear a few weeks ago and I told him what was going on and he was like noooooo this is not normal. They referred me to the Cleveland Clinic over there in Florida. (I am from the islands so medical facilities/ resources aren't the best). When I went there I had a neurology consult and a cardiology consult. They did a brain mri and a few other tests. One of them showed that the pressure in my ears was abnormal and the doctor told me to do therapy to ""train my brain"" to deal with the swaying.....at which I asked him if I was to just live with it? His response was basically yes. I was like but I have not lived with this all my life; and I understand the concept of developing a disease and treating it but I know the cause of my diabetes; my pancreas stopped working. BUT to tell me that I just need to accept it and live with it is unacceptable because we still don't know what is causing it. I went up to International patients department who scheduled all my appointments etc and busted out crying and requested a second opinion. He gave me 12.5mg a day of hydroclorothiazide a day and although it has help the swaying some the medicine makes the shortness of breath a little harder to deal with because when I take in the breaths it causes the area around my heart; the bone included to hurt. I am trying taking the medicine every other day because it is a capsule and honestly I don't think it is helping effectively. International Patients sent me to the ENThroat doctor and he recommended some other balance tests etc including a tilt table test but everyone seems to be missing something because I feel all of the symptoms I am having are tied together. It has been 5 years now that I have been dealing with this and it is taking a serious toll on me. As it stands all my symptoms are: Rocking and swaying blurry vision on and off- one day I can see clearly and others its blurry lack of energy no stamina shortness of breath sharp pains when drawing a deep breath decreased libido hair breakage blacking out with out actually blacking out and I usually have a minty feeling within my head; somewhat tingly Medications I am on: Novolg insulin in the pump- no more than 45 unites per day that includes basal and bolus doses. Roaccutane- 20mg a day to clear up the acne finally- I have been on it for the last 7months and the only side effect was dry lips. Mirena- inserted in 2009- has a 5 year duration Hydrochlorothiazide- 12.5 mg every other day I have just finished my roaccutane treatment and this is the first time since I was about 14 that my skin has been clear. Confirmed Diagnosis: Diabetic-Type 1 PolyCysticOvarian Syndrome RESULTS from Cleveland Clinic Tests: MRI BRAIN and IAC's without and with gadolinium- Their impressions were: 1. No enhancing lesions post gadolinium. 2. Mildly prominent cisterna magna. Slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricals. 3. Non specific UBO's in the white matter with the largest being about 4-5mm in the medial left temporal lobe. This could represent demyelination; vasculitis; migraine; a normal varient or ischemic change. 4. No evidence of mass or enhancing lesion involving the IAC's on either side. 5. Left maxillary sinusitis with hypertrophy of the turbinates. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) and Electrocochleography ECoG: Their impression: 1. Today's results are most consistent with the normal transmission time through the lower auditory system in both ears; there is no electrophysiological evidence of the VIII nerve or pontine level auditory pathway lesions. 2. ECoG examination was ABNORMAL in both ears; presenting electropsysiological evidence of increased labyrinthine pressure in BOTH ears.

392,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,"Not sure where to post this; but here goes. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis/proctitis at age 13; but I'm certain now it's been UC all along. For 12 yrs they tried all kinds of things - cortizone enemas & prednisone; etc - but nothing helped. Finally referred to a gastroenterologist in 1980 who said there were some ""new studies"" that indicated that colitis might be caused by an imbalance in the bacterial environment of the intestine. From the little I've read here so far; that seems to have held true. It also held true for me. My Dr suggested that I add Metamucil to my diet 3 times a day and for the 1st time in 12 yrs the bleeding stopped. I discovered flare ups came after eating pork - I've since decided it's the preservatives in pork (and lunchmeats) that I react to. By avoiding those foods; and using Metamucil for the odd flare-up; I've managed to keep my illness in check for 30 yrs. Until now . . . About a month ago I flared up. This is the 1st time Metamucil hasn't worked. AMs are worst but I'm sometimes up in the night; too. The frequency is much more than ever before; and I've actually had a couple of major accidents when I couldn't get to the washroom in time. The Metamucil has helped some - for the most part once the AM has passed; I manage most of the rest of the day without having to run to the washroom at a moment's notice. But I'm alarmed that Metamucil is not helping the way it always has before. I should mention that I am currently living where I have no health benefits. It's not that I couldn't see a Dr; but we'd have to pay cash and we really don't have the $$. And Drs here are very keen on surgery for this type of illness - I know of a half dozen people who've had the surgery - my daughter's 15 yr old bf among them; and his Dr refused to even consider alternatives. So I'm reluctant to subject myself to Drs. I was encouraged to read that the use of probiotics and such still seems to be used. I guess I'm looking for some suggestions for additional options to help me get this under control again.

396,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,Hello; I am a 54 yr old female from Australia. I have had 2 blood tests(Liver Function) several weeks apart which showed mildly elevated ALP - 126 and 132; and also my platelet levels were not right (I did not get the reading). I requested the clotting tests because I was bruising easily on my hands and arms; small purple bruises from simple bumps. I have had a dull ache in the right upper side of my abdomen; just beneath and also under the rib; also some muscle? pain in the back in that area (I put it down to muscular as it usually appears after physical work). This has happened occasionally over some 20 years; and which I have described as an echo of gall bladder pain (I had mine removed in 1980). Sometimes it feels like a cross between that pain and ulcer pain. 3 nights ago I had a severe bout of pain which lasted several hours. I have had duodenal ulcers in the past as well as reflux; and I have been taking famotidine 40mg daily for many years. I have been on medication for hypertension for 2 years now; and recently had the dosage raised - telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. I have been taking piperazine oestrone sulphate(oestrogen) 2.5 mg for 4 years (for hot flushes) and fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg for many years (for Excema and itchy skin). I am presently 85 kg in weight; having recently lost 8 kg. I used to walk for at least 30 minutes of a morning; but after a prolonged period of suspected bursitis was diagnosed with a torn gluteal tendon which requires surgery to fix. I have been taking 2 Vioxx (rofecoxib 12.5 mg)anti inflammatories daily for 14 months. My lifestyle is really busy; we run a small business and are active in many industry associations; also travel frequently; hence my reluctance to have surgery which will require complete rest for several months. I feel like I am falling apart physically. Consequently on a recent trip to the USA I purchased some Tylenol PM to help me sleep at night (it hurts to lie on my leg); and have been taking 2 every night for 6 weeks. My GP sent me for a CT abdomen scan this morning; but I am unable to swallow the mixture; so I did not have the scan. I have difficulty swallowing even cough mixture. I do also have haemorrhoids which bleed a little; and sometimes pass mucous; but eat unprocessed bran every morning with porridge to stay regular. My questions are - do you think I could have the pain and elevated tests because of the drugs I have been taking; especially the Tylenol? Could the elevated ALP readings be from lack of sleep(I read that somewhere)? Would those symptoms on their own be any indication of liver or other GI problems? Is the bruising a symptom of any GI problem or possibly an age thing? I would have thought I was not old enough. Is it possible to have investigative tests without having to swallow mixtures? - I have avoided suggested colonoscopies and barium enemas at various times over the past few years; I seriously cannot swallow the mixture,2003,2003,,,hello i 54 yr old femal australia i 2 blood testsliv function sever week apart show mild elev alp 126 132 also platelet level right i get read i request clot test i bruis easili hand arm small purpl bruis simpl bump i dull ach right upper side abdomen beneath also rib also muscl pain back area i put muscular usual appear physic work this happen occasion 20 year i describ echo gall bladder pain i mine remov 1980 sometim feel like cross pain ulcer pain 3 night ago i sever bout pain last sever hour i duoden ulcer past well reflux i take famotidin 40mg daili mani year i medic hypertens 2 year recent dosag rais telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazid 125 mg i take piperazin oestron sulphateoestrogen 25 mg 4 year hot flush fexofenadin hydrochlorid 180 mg mani year excema itchi skin i present 85 kg weight recent lost 8 kg i use walk least 30 minut morn prolong period suspect bursiti diagnos torn gluteal tendon requir surgeri fix i take 2 vioxx rofecoxib 125 mganti inflammatori daili 14 month my lifestyl realli busi run small busi activ mani industri associ also travel frequent henc reluct surgeri requir complet rest sever month i feel like i fall apart physic consequ recent trip usa i purchas tylenol pm help sleep night hurt lie leg take 2 everi night 6 week my gp sent ct abdomen scan morn i unabl swallow mixtur i scan i difficulti swallow even cough mixtur i also haemorrhoid bleed littl sometim pass mucous eat unprocess bran everi morn porridg stay regular my question think i could pain elev test drug i take especi tylenol could elev alp read lack sleepi read somewher would symptom indic liver gi problem is bruis symptom gi problem possibl age thing i would thought i old enough is possibl investig test without swallow mixtur i avoid suggest colonoscopi barium enema various time past year i serious swallow mixtur

398,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I have muscle spasm in or around the ribs on both sides (in the front under the breast and sometimes in the back at the same horizontal position); it feels like a ball rolling; in that it switches sides. It occurs even at night during sleep; painful enough to wake me. I only know that when I relax and stretch (the side where the knot is) using several positions I have to wait till it goes away; in many cases to have it return in other places described above. What does it mean; how do I treat it. I have high blood pressure and the meds deplete my potassium so I take a prescription supplement for that. What should I be asking my doctor.,2007,2007,,,i muscl spasm around rib side front breast sometim back horizont posit feel like ball roll switch side it occur even night sleep pain enough wake i know i relax stretch side knot use sever posit i wait till goe away mani case return place describ what mean i treat i high blood pressur med deplet potassium i take prescript supplement what i ask doctor

400,Hydrochlorothiazide+hypertension,I was really hoping for a suggestion as to why I may have developed an indentation in the top of my head. At first I thought I was crazy; and that it was impossible for that to happen; but over the last few months it seems to have grown and now anyone who feels the top of my head can easily feel it. It scares me; especially since my husband had brain surgery less than 2 years ago- (symptoms completely different of course) I am 35 years old; the only time I remember hitting my head really hard is when I was in elementary school and I fell and hit my head on a tile floor. I have had a history of passing out and having seizures but the doctors never figured out for sure what caused it and it hasn't happened for a few years. The best they came up with was blood sugar; and dehydration as a cause for those episodes; although I never had a MRI or anything of my head. I don't get pains from it; it may be a little tender if I press on the indent kind of hard. Is there any condition that would cause my skull to cave in? please help!,2008,2008,,,i realli hope suggest i may develop indent top head at first i thought i crazi imposs happen last month seem grown anyon feel top head easili feel it scare especi sinc husband brain surgeri less 2 year ago symptom complet differ cours i 35 year old time i rememb hit head realli hard i elementari school i fell hit head tile floor i histori pass seizur doctor never figur sure caus hasnt happen year the best came blood sugar dehydr caus episod although i never mri anyth head i dont get pain may littl tender i press indent kind hard is condit would caus skull cave pleas help

404,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks in advance for your answer. History: 53;non smoker;no drugs non drinker. About 2 months ago became aware of increased amount of PACs and PVCs. Had them since childhood but only a few to non a day. Holter and other tests led cardio to diagnos as benign. Had less than 1000 PACs per day and less than 50 PVCs. They started to increase from 1-2 an hour and within a week to the present 1 every minute which was my reason to seek medical attention. The doc started me on a low dose of atenolol due to moderate hypertension and the palps. 25mg a day but it knocked my heart rate to 42-50 and pressure at peak to 85/55. The dose was reduced to half of a 25mg x 3 times a day which kept the pressure at a more constant 115/75 or there abouts. The palpitations also are milder but not much less in number. Question #1: I have been on the atenolol now for 4 weeks and now there is trace blood in the urine as well as hematospermia. Urologist thinks its not due to the atenolol but to a prostatitis and is giving me Levaquin 500mg once a day for it. Have been on it one week but the hematospermia persists and the urine test still shows trace of blood. Can the blood in urine be from the blood from the hematospermia. I know that your not a urologist but could still tie things together. Question #2: I've read posts that indicate that having these PAC's and PVC's will someday lead to a-fib of varying seriousness.

406,Atenolol+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40.0,Female,40yearold ladi i diagnos hypertens 200100 sinc 2005 i take atenolol 25 mg night 2 year in 2007 i deliv babi boy age 37 sinc i rapid weight gain short breath i walk step climb stair i feel uneasi breath i exert after rest goe i continu atenolol 25 mg i underw echo 2008 normal i also underw lipid profil ldl triglycerid high sinc bp control atenolol cardiologist suggest take carvedilol 625 mg after 2 year i underw master health checkup i underw echo treadmil test chest xray blood urin test again reveal bp high ldl triglycerid high cardiologist precrib month carvedilol anticholesterol medic even take drug i uneasi chest i exert he suggest undergo angiogram then i check anoth cardiologist chang carvedilol amlodipin bp then chang combin atenolol amlodipin bp fine but i still uneasi chest i exert bp control sometim goe 150100 my thyroid function normal my diabet test normal my triglycerid ldl still reduc i take atorvastatin lipid last 6 month i sever daytim somnol i work medic transcriptionist my job stress job i depress took antidepress 3 month last year after take i irregular cycl weight gain i stop my daytim sleepi sever i abl concentr work i abl peac sleep when i sleep night i feel awak whole night race thought i feel rest i get i heavi snore i underw pulmonari function test normal i took chest xray doctor felt i might cardiomegali i underw eye exam vision perfect normal except dri eye i use artifici tear i extern hemorrhoid kind suggest test done daytim somnol rapid weight gain i check almost specialti i confus reason would
407,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 53-year old female who is not overweight. My blood pressure has always been good; usually 112-120 over 66-72. Two months ago; I suffered a severe headache that literally dropped me to my knees. I was outside talking to a neighbor; bent down and straightened up and my head started hurting; in the area a baseball cap would fit; and wouldn't quit. My husband and neighbor had to carry me into the house. I was taken to the hospital; my blood pressure was quite high (due to the pain; I'm guessing). They did a CT and found nothing. Two weeks later; my head started to hurt; I checked my blood pressure (I'm a nurse and was at work); my BP was 179/119. I went to Urgent Care; but was sent to ER instead; where they did an MRI/MRA of my brain. My blood pressure was 204/120. They gave me Atenolol; and after my BP came back down into the safe range they released me. The results of my MRI came back normal; but my MRA was abnormal. Apparently I am missing the A1 segment on the right; however; I am still getting sufficient blood flow to the brain. The ER doctor called me and said it is probably something I was born with; and doubts it presents a problem; but still wants me to see a neurologist (which I am doing end of the month). My blood pressure is still high; I check it three times a day and yesterday it was 165/102; 159/102 and 154/85. The day before that: 153/90; 124/84;157/94. This morning I took it after I got up; and before coffee; it was 143/100. I should mention that I have been taking Atenolol 50mg q.d. Prior to that the ER had me taking Clonidine twice a day; but only gave me a two prescription. My BP still ran high. I'm just wondering if high cholesterol could be the cause? or part of it? I have no idea what it is currently; but two years ago it ok. My PCP hasn't suggested having it checked; but am wondering if that might not be a good idea? I am not taking any medications; either prescribed or over the counter; except the Atenolol. I am somewhat concerned; especially since this seems to have come on so suddenly. I would appreciate any thoughts you might have. And when is a BP reading considered to be in the danger zone??

408,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 23 year old female with a long history of hypertension. I was first diagnosed when I was about 8 when my doctor saw on a visit that my blood pressure was within stroke range. I had been on atenolol (50mg) for years until I hit some hard times and could not pay. I went back onto atenalol last year in october because of constant pressure on my chest and a particular episode where I had sudden chest pain; felt like someone sitting on my chest and numbness in arms/feeling like ice in veins. I was stupid and didn't go to the hospital right away but I was smart enough to go to a clinic and get me my medicine again. I have been taking my medicine and I have lowered my sodium intake as well as attempting to lose weight. I have PCOS which causes insulin resistance making it very hard to lose weight but with my metformin it's been slowly going down. Yesterday at work I suddenly developed a new kind of palpitation. It felt like a flutter at first and then like banging from inside my chest. The beats were irregular with no pattern and very fast. I felt disorented and dizzy and went to the break room. Several other coworkers tried to help me as I was unsure as if I should go to the hospital. One could clearly feel my pulse just by placing her hand on my shoulder. I could feel the blood surging from my chest above my right brest up into the side of my neck feeling almost frothy. I was shaking and even now most of what happened seems foggy. It calmed down after ten minutes and after taking it easy sitting down to work my head cleared. Even still I feel a bruised achy feeling in my chest almost like a cold feeling. I can't sleep because I can feel my pulse and the ache in my chest. It's not sharp or getting worse but just feels like the after affects of someone hitting me. Could this be something new or is my hypertension needing addressed further? What could this event have been?,2010,2010,23.0,Male,hello i 23 year old femal long histori hypertens i first diagnos i 8 doctor saw visit blood pressur within stroke rang i atenolol 50mg year i hit hard time could pay i went back onto atenalol last year octob constant pressur chest particular episod i sudden chest pain felt like someon sit chest numb armsfeel like ice vein i stupid didnt go hospit right away i smart enough go clinic get medicin i take medicin i lower sodium intak well attempt lose weight i pcos caus insulin resist make hard lose weight metformin slowli go yesterday work i sudden develop new kind palpit it felt like flutter first like bang insid chest the beat irregular pattern fast i felt disor dizzi went break room sever cowork tri help i unsur i go hospit one could clear feel puls place hand shoulder i could feel blood surg chest right brest side neck feel almost frothi i shake even happen seem foggi it calm ten minut take easi sit work head clear even still i feel bruis achi feel chest almost like cold feel i cant sleep i feel puls ach chest it sharp get wors feel like affect someon hit could someth new hypertens need address what could event
409,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I've been taking Lisinopril 40mg; and crazy dizziness and headaches occurred and brought my blood pressure down to around 90/50; so my doctor had me take only 20mg lisinopril per day. With 20mg; my blood pressure was constantly at 160-170/100. Then; the doctor told me to take Atenolol 25mg at night and lisinopril 20mg in the morning. It brought my blood pressure down to around 100/60 regularly; but recently it started going up again. I often have electric tingling/weakness in my hands/arms/legs and feel like I will faint. Blood pressure fluctuates from 160/100 to 100/60 from one day to another. Doctor thinks I have panic attack and should take Xanax for it. But; I feel like the medication combination (atenolol/lisinopril) is giving me hard time. I asked doctor to please change the medication but he refuses; and he thinks it's the anxiety attack that's the cause for all this. What should I do? Is Lisinopril/Atenolol a proven combination to help hypertension? Thanks.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,hi ive take lisinopril 40mg crazi dizzi headach occur brought blood pressur around 9050 doctor take 20mg lisinopril per day with 20mg blood pressur constant 160170100 then doctor told take atenolol 25mg night lisinopril 20mg morn it brought blood pressur around 10060 regular recent start go i often electr tinglingweak handsarmsleg feel like i faint blood pressur fluctuat 160100 10060 one day anoth doctor think i panic attack take xanax but i feel like medic combin atenolollisinopril give hard time i ask doctor pleas chang medic refus think anxieti attack that caus what i is lisinoprilatenolol proven combin help hypertens thank

413,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 74 yr old female; very active; moderate weight. I've been treated for hypertension for over 10 years; trying various meds with limited success. Have been on Atenolol 100 mg; Hydroclorothiazide 25 mg; Losartian100 mg and Amlodopine 5 mg for several years now. Over the past 4 years I have had episodes of feeling unwell for an hour or so and eventually fainting. After a full workup I was told that no cause was found other than perhaps I become dehydrated causing my BP to drop to very low levels i.e. Labile Hypertension. My BP seems to normally run around 135 to 145 / 78 to 85. Checking it when I am starting to get the 'unwell' feeling I find it has dropped to 103/71. I realize that this is a 'good' reading but I definitely don't feel well when it is this low. Yesterday it was in the low range all day but went back to 'normal' at bed time. This AM it is back down to 103/71 again with the associated nauseated sick feeling.

414,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor and has suggested a short term disability (90 days) from work to determine if stress is actually the root cause and to see if being away will lower the pressure. As well; although no kidney problems have been shown; he is also referring me to a kidney specialist for an additionial consultation to determine if he can see anything else that may be causing this issue. At this time; I feel I am getting excellent care; however; I am very concerned that these elevated levels will trigger a stroke. I would appreciate your comments on any other plausible medicial condition which you may feel might be the cause and your feedback on the short term disability aspect.,2008,2008,,,i 50 year old male juli ide secondari hypertnes 230130i herid hypertens issu sinc i 23 manag normal level singl dose 50 mg beta blocker tenormin atenolol sinc juli i place follow medic norvasc 10mg dailyrampiril 20 mg dailyatacand 16mg daili tiazac 360mg daili tterazosin 6mg daili spironliacton 25 mg daili well 81mg aspirin although i cholesterol problem i take crestor 10 mgi ekg echo cardiogram indaict blockag although small valv problem consid root caus bp issuei also doppler imag kidney confirm renal arteri issu substanti blood work confirm adren gland issuesalso wear 24 bp monitor three time confirm bp high throughout 24 hour period present medic bp remain 190120mi specialist indic feel stress contrbut factor suggest short term disabl 90 day work determin stress actual root caus see away lower pressur as well although kidney problem shown also refer kidney specialist additioni consult determin see anyth els may caus issu at time i feel i get excel care howev i concern elev level trigger stroke i would appreci comment plausibl medici condit may feel might caus feedback short term disabl aspect
415,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 34 yr old woman. I have 2 children. I am 5'6"" and weigh 135 lbs. (so; within normal limits) I have a history of smoking. I quit 7 months ago. I had pregnancy induced hypertension at the end of my first pregnancy which resolved at the birth of my child. I also had hypertension immediately following the birth of my 2nd child that resolved in a couple of weeks. A few months ago I had two episodes of hypertension while at work 177/112 and 160/100. I was working a night shift both times and had drank an energy drink. Both episodes the elevated BP was accompanied by a headache and lasted several hours. I visited my Dr. following these episodes and she thought it was the energy drink causing the high BP. Since then I quit drinking energy drinks and even quit drinking caffeine regularly. ( I now have no more than one caffeinated beverage a week). Since then I have checked my blood pressure periodically and it is usually around 120/78. Two nights ago I was walking around the house and felt my heart skipping around. I have felt palpitations before; but they always went away right away. I continued to feel these palpitations so went in to the ER. EKG showed Premature Junctional Contractions. Dr. stated that these were harmless. Blood work all came back negative. But; BP was elevated between 150/100; 165/121; and 180/111. I was given Toprol 25mg; which I have taken daily since.

419,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a delimma and am hoping someone could help me on this. I had a severe case of SVT in Feb'08 and was prescribed Atenolol 25 mg each day. I was taking Atenolol when I realised I was pregnant; the 1s day of my last period was 2nd March'08. I stopped taking Atenolol on 4th April. My doctor is advising me to go for a termination of pregnancy as this medicine could have serious effects on the foetus. But I don't want to do that as I feel the actual exposure to foetus is really very small to worry about. Any advise is appreciated.

421,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi I've been on beta blockers for the last 10 years primarily for hypertension initially caused by anxiety. Up until 12 months ago I was on Propranolol 80 mg daily this was then changed to Atenolol 25 mg daily with a view to stopping using. Basically my anxiety returned and I bottled out of stopping them. However fast fwd a year and I have been experiencing ectopic heart beats quite often when exercising so being worried about these back to the docs I went. I under went a 24 hour ecg and results showed the ectopic beats and Bradycardia down to 36bpm at times. As such I have been told I need to come off the Atenolol which I have been doing for the last 5days by chopping tablets in half which I have been told to do for the next two weeks then stop.

422,Atenolol+hypertension,A year ago at the age of 44 I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and prescribed 25mg Atenolol daily. I was 40-50lbs overweight and in the past year have returned to competetive cycling to help weight management. I'm now riding 40 - 50 mile training rides and about 100 miles weekly but find I've got to a level where no amount of extra training improves my performance; particularly on hills. Cyclists of the same age are often faster. Similarly when using a heart rate monitor I can't seem to get my heart rate above 140bpm whatever I do; whether in the gym or on the bike. I assume this is an effect of the drug. Also I don't get out of breath when training as much as I used to. Does this mean the drug prevents me from working anywhere near my anaerobic threshold? Will no amount of training alow me to improve so long as I keep taking Atenolol? As my level of fitness is greatly improved compared to when I began taking the Atenolol and my weight reduced (by over 30lbs) and bearing in mind the low 25mg daily dose is it logical that if I stopped the medication the higher intensity training I might undertake would benefit my condition?,2003,2003,,,a year ago age 44 i diagnos high blood pressur prescrib 25mg atenolol daili i 4050lbs overweight past year return competet cycl help weight manag im ride 40 50 mile train ride 100 mile week find ive got level amount extra train improv perform particular hill cyclist age often faster similar use heart rate monitor i cant seem get heart rate 140bpm whatev i whether gym bike i assum effect drug also i dont get breath train much i use doe mean drug prevent work anywher near anaerob threshold will amount train alow improv long i keep take atenolol as level fit great improv compar i began take atenolol weight reduc 30lbs bear mind low 25mg daili dose logic i stop medic higher intens train i might undertak would benefit condit
423,Atenolol+hypertension,"Two quick questions: is there a difference between high blood pressure and hypertension (I noticed there are 2 different topics listed here) Also; I began taking 12.5mg of atenolol 2x/day - it's only my second day; so in total I took 3 pills. I noticed a feeling of calm come over me; however; I was told it might make me sleepy. I had the opposite reaction. As soon as I took it; I developed a metallic taste in my mouth; my arms started to hurt (second dose it was okay); but I feel like I have dry mouth (not totally but it almost feels like a swollen tongue). I drank some more but it doesn't really help. The odd thing was that it immediately curbed my appetite. The first day I ate nothing after I took the pill and only started feeling hungry when it was wearing off in time for the night pill. I felt spacey all day from not eating (like low blood sugar) but I had no appetite whatsoever. When I took the night pill; I was up the whole night. It's almost like a shot of adrenaline. It is worrying me. I took my morning pill and the same thing happen. My appetite was gone in no time; and when I had to drive in the afternoon to get my daughter from school; I was so spaced it out it was scary. I thought maybe my pressure dropped. The first day the reading shot up to 1 79/112 (I'm usally 150's/100's); and then stayed high most of the day; but today it seemed to have dropped to mid 120's or so. I went out tonight and didnt' take the pill; and yet i was still soaring with adrenaline (I still can't sleep and it 's 4am); the metallic taste is there and that swelling of the tongue. so bizarre. my daughter was like ""mom; go to bed; how are you still awake and hyper."" My bp was 179/100's - not good - probably because i missed tonight's dosage. But I'm scared to take it again. I took a xanax .25mg to try and sleep. Any help would be appreciated. I'm seeing my dr on monday.. This is the first bp med that worked a bit for me; as the calcium channel blockers (norvasc and plendil which caused vomiting) gave me suicidal (that's what they called them) cluster headaches and elevated my bp to 250/135. I'm scared that if i missed the night dose i might have a stroke (i read that on one of the boards if u suddenly stop taking bp meds you could have a stroke). I have a blockage in my renal artery (one dr said it is thick on one side but clear on the other; also the renal doppler showed a bruit ad significant restriction of blood flow; the MRI showed it as well.....but not conclusively. I'm getting very frustrated with it all. I've tried natural remedies; lsost weight and yet nothing. So atenolol is my last resort.

The dosage was reduced to 12.5 mg and since my BP has been normal (120/70). However; I still have periods of low HR (40-45). I am a runnner (although not much in the past 10 months); but do not know what my resting HR was prior to starting Atenolol. The side effect in the first few days were fatigue; etc. However; in the past week or so; I've had ringing in my ears and a ""jittery"" feeling that seems to be getting worse. This prevents me from sleeping at times and when I am able to sleep; wake up during the night with these feelings. I take the medication just before I go to sleep. My doctor thinks these symptoms could be caused by anxiety and has perscribed Lexapro. He has suggested I take this for a week and then switch my BP medicine to Lisinopril due to the Bradycardia.

I am on the atenolol for borderline hypertension and mostly because of benign palpitations. Have had all the tests over the years...palps diagnosed as stress related. I dont get much exercise...but I do take 6 flights of stairs DOWN every day at work. ( no..I havent mastered going UP yet!) I am very overweight; have been for several years now; so trying to take it slow. Am 46 years old. My normal pulse at rest is between 58-65. I take my pulse when I get to my car after taking the stairs down; and usually it doesnt jump much---is around 95-100 immediatly after the stairs. It goes down to a normal rate really quick--usually within a few minutes... (1-4). THe past couple days Ive taken the stairs down; and feel quite winded--and pulse was 113 on Friday.

He is having a lot of side affects like; short term memory loss that he denies; he is losing his hair; weight gain (he is very active man) and seems emotionally unstable.

He won't let me come to the doctor with him so I am in the dark with this. He doctor is young - aboiut 33 yrs and I am concerned he isn't experienced enough.

434,Atenolol+hypertension,"O.K. I had been debating whether to post my question here because I feel that is is very complex; or at least the lead up to it is. To make a very long story as short as I can; I was very healthy up until I was 22 years old. I am now 24 years old. When I was 21 my father was killed by a drunk driver and this sent me into a depression; although I never went to a doctor or took any medication for it. When I was 22 I graduated from college and took a full-time job as an operations manager; working days and nights alike; at least 70 hours per week. In January of 2007; one month before my 24th birthday; I experienced what I can only describe as a panick attack. I was riding in the passenger seat with my boss; when all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint. I then felt my hands and feet get numb and felt a big pressure in my chest. I asked him to please drive me to the hospital cuz I felt something was really wrong with me. When I arrived at the hospital; I got even more scared and began to have trouble breathing. They brought out the EKG machine to the waiting room and said all was normal. The doctor said that all the blood work and EKG were fine; but that he wanted to keep me over night for tests. Over night; I received three more EKG's; chest X-Ray's; a CT-scan (where they inject a yellow colored iodine to map your arteries); and the whole time I was hooked up to a little box that was monitoring my heart for the entire 24 hours. In less than 18 hours they cleared me to go home with no restrictions. Over the next two weeks of out-patient visits; my Internal medicine doctor noticed that my blood pressure was consistently high; with an average of 145-150/90-95. He put me on Atenolol 25-mg and on Xanax as needed for the anxiety; that he diagnosed as GAD. Well; my blood pressure improved to an average of about 130/80-85 or so; which he felt was satisfactory so he asked to not see me for another 3-4 months. However; during this time I experience another 2 ""panick attacks"" with similar symptoms to the ones mentioned above. Needless to say; I went for a second opinion with a Family Practitioner; whom assured me that my heart was fine based on the hospital results; but he added a 10-mg dose of Enalapril to go with the 25-mg of Atenolol because his goal was to get my blood pressure to an a systolic reading less than 120 and a diastolic reading of less than 80 on a consistent basis. He also took me off of Xanax and put me on Lexapro 10-mg. In addition; he asked me to exercise more and lose some weight. I did everything he told me and the results were great. My blood pressure now is an average of maximum 120 systolic over 78 diastolic. I run 2.5 miles at least 3-4 times per week; and although my diet isn't the best; I greatly cut back on my consumption of sodium; saturated fat; and caffeine. Now; today I went in to another doctor in my hometown b/c I had strep throat and he was schocked to see that a 24-year old man is on Atenolol. He said that I should immidiatly go see a cardiologist; b/c he suspects that I am on Atenolol b/c there is something wrong with my heart. This scared me more than I can explain. Neither of my parents have any history of heart disease; heart attack; or stroke. Neither do my grandparents. My mom has hypertension as does my maternal grandmother. When my dad passed away at the age of 59 his only ailment was high cholesterol. My question is this: 1.) Was his assumption that there is probably something wrong with my heart accurate; because I am on atenolol? 2.) What kind of a future do I have to look forward to as a 24-yeard old man with hypertension? I know my message is very long but any help you could provide me would be greatly appreciated.

436,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was advised by my doctor to change from 25 mg (once per day) Atenolol for moderate Hypertension (which was not reducing BP well) to Lisinopril (5mg). I was on 25 mg once a day of Atenolol. Through some miscommunication with my Doctor; I didn't correctly understand that I was to reduce dosage gradually; so I went pretty well straight off it and started experiencing arrhythmias...not really so much fast heart beat; but irregular (PVC's?; ectopic beats?) what I would simply refer to as rather ""sloppy"" and not consistently normal sinus rhythm which was very concerning. I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol. My question: Is it reasonable to expect that a gradual (over 10 days) reduction in the dosage would result in my being able to get off the medication without Arrhythmatic symptoms?

439,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was put on hctz 12.5 mg around 2006; but knowing I have severe ""white coat syndrome""; I never took it until I tore some muscles in my upper back and the Dr. insisted I start the med. in May of 07. I have a B/P monitor which checks out against the ones at the Dr.s office; so I was pretty sure my home readings were accurate and they were OK. I was in a great deal of pain from my back injury and PT was making it worse. My personal trainer suggested a med that had helped with a back problem; and my physician sent in a perscription for it. After one dose; I ended up in the ER in the middle of the night with outrageously high B/P. They got that fixed; but it went way up again the next day and I saw another MD who immediately put me on 12.5 mg Atenolol. That was in July of 07. I am 5'2"" tall; weigh 116# and have no cholesterol problems or any other (known) medical problems that simple blood tests would uncover. While on Atenolol I got very out of breath on my daily walks and ; being a SCUBA diver; I had a very scary out of breath episode under water that made me decide to try to get off the Beta blocker. My current MD had me take my regular dose every other day for a week and then stop. The first week after stopping; my energy level was off the charts; but this past week there has been a lot of heart-pounding; rapid heartbeats; soaring B/P from time to time; a rushing sound in my ears that makes me think my B/P is way up and my fears just make it much worse. She said I might have to double up on the hctz if there was a Beta blocker backlash; but I really want to stop those; too. Is there any hope for that and is there anything I can do to help myself through this? I don't smoke; I seldom drink and never more than 1 glass of red wine or 1-2 beers. I exercise regularly; and have cut salt out of my life as much as possible and take vitamins regularly along with cutting out red meat. There is a strong family history of heart problems which none of my Dr's seem to address - most don't even get up from the computer to listen to my heart.

I exercise frequently ( 3 times a week-1hr soccer); good lipid profile and recently from an echo i was found to have mild lvh with an IVS of 12cm. At that time; my bp was high at 145/92. Previously; my bp fluctuated between 120-145/80-95. I have been on 50mg Cozaar everyday. My bp now averages 109-115/72-78. My treadmill stress test was normal. My resting ECG was abnormal. My questions are: With a low heart rate; a suddenly reduced bp and and an existing lvh condition; would these pose a risk? Is there a specific condition that Im suffering from?

443,Atenolol+hypertension,Does atrial fibrillation cause pulmonary hypertension? When I had AF (last year persistently for six months); my right side pressure in the heart was at the upper reference limit. My proBNP rose to over 2400 (upper ref. limit about 200). I had often ventilation difficulties; chest tightness. My ability to excercise was sometimes poor; sometimes ok. I had atenolol; Digoxin and Marevan medication. Thyroid Erfa was for hypothyroidism. I have had chest tightness (at the diaphragm) occasionally before the AF and a few times this year. The cause is unknown. I have also had mild obstruction of small bronchiles for a few years (no more in this year). Sarcoidosis is suspected now. There is a small unspecified tumour and a few tiny ones in my lungs.

448,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it. I also have an rx for Ativan; but the atenolol makes me pretty mellow; so I don't see using that at all. Anyone have similar profiles or conditions? Anyone know of any interractions to any of these meds with atenolol? My pharm and doc say no; but just doublechecking.

451,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I have been having rapid heart beat and 12;000 PVCs a day for the past 2 years; since giving birth to my daughter. My question is whether or not I should take 25 mg of Atenolol twice a day. My primary care doc says I need to take it; but I've been told by a cardiac doc that my PVCs are benign. So; is taking the beta-blocker just to make me feel better? Or will it actually benefit my body somehow? I have taken it before; and it does help lower my heart rate and frequency of PVCs.

453,Atenolol+hypertension,My heart feels like it's racing all the time; which didn't happen prior to starting Atenolol 5-years ago. I 100mg per day so I took 1/2-pill for 5-days then 1/4-pill for 5-days then nothing and I've been off for 7-days now. My Dr. said they don't prescribe Atenolol to active people so got me off it and started me on Amlodipine 10mg; which I was allergic to so I have also stopped that and am off everything now (again; for 7-days as I was taking both drugs during the 1/4-Atenolol pill days). My blood pressure ranges around 145/92 w/ BPM @ 85 while at rest now that I'm off of everything and really wasn't that much lower while taking Atenolol; just a few numbers lower is all. I would really like to be med free; especially now that my heart is racing the way that it is and my chest feeling like my heart is ready to protrude through it. Could Atenolol use over the years be causing this to happen and will it subside eventually? How long does it take for Atenolol to completely leave your system? I don't eat red meat or pork and I eat lots of veggies so other than diet; are there alternatives that could help me reduce my BP that I may not be aware of (other than exercise; which I do 7-days a week) and a low sodium diet?,2011,2011,42.0,Female,my heart feel like race time didnt happen prior start atenolol 5year ago i 100mg per day i took 12pill 5day 14pill 5day noth ive 7day my dr said dont prescrib atenolol activ peopl got start amlodipin 10mg i allerg i also stop everyth 7day i take drug 14atenolol pill day my blood pressur rang around 14592 w bpm 85 rest im everyth realli wasnt much lower take atenolol number lower i would realli like med free especi heart race way chest feel like heart readi protrud could atenolol use year caus happen subsid eventu how long take atenolol complet leav system i dont eat red meat pork i eat lot veggi diet altern could help reduc bp i may awar exercis i 7day week low sodium diet
454,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 32 years old male. I have high blood pressure for last 10 years and I am taking Atenlol 50mg for last 6 years. I started running marathons in 2008 and since then I have completed 4 marathons with an average time of 3:40:00. I consulted my doctor and he said its good idea for my health to keep this routine; although Atenlol might be a hindrance in exercise. Personally; I feel quite relaxed after each training run and even marathons. During exercise session my heart rate is always less than 150 bpm while its 40-45 bpm at rest state. I didn't had this problem earlier but now-a-days I feel quite over-breathed in first 30 minutes of the run but it stabilizes after that. I also have the tendency to gain weight very easily. My question here is: - Is it a good idea to run marathons with my disease and prescribed medication? - If yes; then why do I feel over-breathed recently and why do I gain the weight within a week time if I stop exercising ? - I also want to increase my marathon time; but it seems the pace of 5 mins/km is the limit for me. Does Atenlol is really limiting my speed.

455,Atenolol+hypertension,Hepatologist suggested my doctor put me on something to control Esophageal Varices; which after a test; were discovered in me. The severity is said to be medium. I've don’t some reading with contradicting beliefs from various doctors and clinical trials. However; all doctors seem to agree that a beta blocker like Atenolol is necessary for a long term use. Just want to know if any of you are on this treatment at 25mg per day. I understand there are some risks; but that the result of lowering blood pressure and heartbeats can help reduce the development of a more serious Varices problem; which in some cases can cause death form unstoppable internal bleeding.

456,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor; as I am employed in a high stress job with a major financial company and has recommended a short trem disability to determine if being away will cause the BP to go down.Although I am not adverse to this; I would apprecaite any additional plausable medical issue that may be root cause. My situation is being closely monitored and I do feel I am getting good care/treatment;however; I am concerned that this could lead to something bigger ie; a stroke if I can not get this under control. One of the issues I have also dealt with along with this is a rapid heart beat and beta blockers were increased to assist with this problem. Given the secondary hypertension and the heart beat I am somewhat concerned. Could the heart beat issue cause this BP as opposed to a stress related issue.,2008,2008,,,i 50 year old male juli ide secondari hypertnes 230130i herid hypertens issu sinc i 23 manag normal level singl dose 50 mg beta blocker tenormin atenolol sinc juli i place follow medic norvasc 10mg dailyrampiril 20 mg dailyatacand 16mg daili tiazac 360mg daili tterazosin 6mg daili spironliacton 25 mg daili well 81mg aspirin although i cholesterol problem i take crestor 10 mgi ekg echo cardiogram indaict blockag although small valv problem consid root caus bp issuei also doppler imag kidney confirm renal arteri issu substanti blood work confirm adren gland issuesalso wear 24 bp monitor three time confirm bp high throughout 24 hour period present medic bp remain 190120mi specialist indic feel stress contrbut factor i employ high stress job major financi compani recommend short trem disabl determin away caus bp go downalthough i advers i would apprecait addit plausabl medic issu may root caus my situat close monitor i feel i get good caretreatmenthowev i concern could lead someth bigger ie stroke i get control one issu i also dealt along rapid heart beat beta blocker increas assist problem given secondari hypertens heart beat i somewhat concern could heart beat issu caus bp oppos stress relat issu
457,Atenolol+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

458,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. (1) Could you please quote if possible the success rate for PVC ablations at the CCF; also the complication rate for this procedure? (2) At what stage is a PVC ablation recommended or does it depends symptoms associated with frequency? (3) Any new information on why one can go for months or years without any significant amount of PVC and then they flare up at the rate of thouasnds a day for weeks to months on end before subsiding. Could some autoimmune disorder or connective inflammatory disease be a trigger? I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis and this is the pattern with my PVCs flare up; just curious; I haven't had any in over 2 and half years. (4) I take Cozaar 50mg daily and atenolol (atenolol) 100mg daily in divided doses; 25mg 4 times daily; I find it more effective in helping the palpitations that way; my internist agrees with this approach. I read an article recently; can't site the article right now of some negative studies regarding atenolol and treating high blood pressure; would this apply to its effect on palpitations also; Have you all seen the article or information on this information or study?

459,Atenolol+hypertension,Can a severe isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation result in pulmonary hypertension? When I had my first echo a year ago my PA pressures were in the 30s. Last May my mitral valve was replaced; maize procedure done and PPM implanted as a result of sinus node dysfunction. I had right heart failure after surgery that has persisted and become worse. An echo last summer showed severe regurg of TV and PA pressures of 42. Symptoms are now more severe so a stress echo was done last week. PA pressures at rest were 48 and with activity 69 and pulse ox drop to 85. A walking pulse ox went from 98 to 88. IVC and right atrium was very large. I will be having a right heart cath next week to confirm the functional data. I do understand why PA pressures would increase with MV regurg but since it was not up initially please explain to me why it would be up now with the isolated TV regurg issue. Physiologically; I just don't understand that. Would a repair of the tricuspid valve fix this problem? I have seen a surgeon but he has been reluctant to go back in; first surgery was 8 months ago. I have had reoccuring atrial flutter (cardioverted 5 times in eight months; on amiodarone) with a failed ablation attempt secondary to the nature of the tricuspid valve. So an intraoperative ablation has been proposed if they elect to repair the valve. I am young and healthy for the most part though I did have thyroid cancer with a radical neck and parathyroidectomy which complicates taking diuretics. In spite of all of this; I continue to work full time though it is becoming more difficult.,2003,2004,,,can sever isol tricuspid valv regurgit result pulmonari hypertens when i first echo year ago pa pressur 30s last may mitral valv replac maiz procedur done ppm implant result sinus node dysfunct i right heart failur surgeri persist becom wors an echo last summer show sever regurg tv pa pressur 42 symptom sever stress echo done last week pa pressur rest 48 activ 69 puls ox drop 85 a walk puls ox went 98 88 ivc right atrium larg i right heart cath next week confirm function data i understand pa pressur would increas mv regurg sinc initi pleas explain would isol tv regurg issu physiolog i dont understand would repair tricuspid valv fix problem i seen surgeon reluct go back first surgeri 8 month ago i reoccur atrial flutter cardiovert 5 time eight month amiodaron fail ablat attempt secondari natur tricuspid valv so intraop ablat propos elect repair valv i young healthi part though i thyroid cancer radic neck parathyroidectomi complic take diuret in spite i continu work full time though becom difficult
460,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation for as long as I can remember and take Atenolol daily. I had an ECHO last week and was surprised and confused by the results. I was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and I had mild tricuspid regurgitation along with a mild RV enlargement and mild pulmonary hypertension. The cardiologist did not seem too concerned. He said my numbers were just barely over the normal ranges. My RV dimension was 2.5 cm and my RVSP was 37mmHg. Should I be getting a second opinion? Is this high pressure due to my mitral regurgitation? I am so concerned and was so overwelhmed and feel I did not get all my answers. I would appreciate any advice or commets.

463,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have had hypertension for a while; which I've tried to control with diet and exercise (walking). Those efforts were not successful as I was unable to maintain a diet and exercise program over time. I'm quite overweight. My bp at my last doctor's visit was 160/100; and a week before; at the doctor's; it was 140/100. I have always had fairly good bp; until this past year. I'm 55. Hypertension runs in my family - now; 4 of 5 of us have it; as does my mother. My doctor declined to give me a diuretic; as I have a cystocele (a hernia of sorts in the bladder wall; which makes it bulge into the vagina; causing difficulties urinating at times) although we discussed that possibility. He chose to give me Atenolol; 25 mg. once a day instead; without a diuretic. He - and the pharmacist - assured me it's well tolerated; for the most part; a mild drug; and so on. I have been doing lots of reading on the internet; and also; of the monograph provided with the medicine. I am reading about side effects such as dizziness; shortness of breath; all kinds of awful things. I have dizziness due to vertigo (believed by my Dr. to be due to fluid in ears / virus); and wonder how I'll be able to tell whether any diziness is a side effect or the vertigo. It's all very new and confusing to me. I seek input from any doctors on this forum about how folks do using this drug; as a rule; and whether I should ask for a diuretic instead (I know you can't be that specific as you don't know me). I have no other medical issues that I know of; other than being quite overweight and having a pituitary tumor that was being reated with cabergoline. I also have cut my salt back to 2;000 mg. or less; and try to walk most days; at least a mile.

464,Atenolol+hypertension,"Can you please expand on the so-called ""J"" Curve; and the newly released INVEST study that suggests that lowering Diastolic too much can actually cause a cardiac event. I have read that INVEST and also the JNC study says that at levels below 85 mm; the risk of a cardiac event can increase. Am I reading these reports incorrectly? I hope so; because with my hypertension under control; my Diastolic is averiging in the 60's.....is that good(as I thought); or Bad?

465,Atenolol+hypertension,I run about 3 miles a day on the treadmill (usually 3 miles in 30 mins). I'm taking 25mg of Atenolol 2x a day for pvcs and mild hypertension (my blood pressure varies between 125/80-140/80 but has gone higher on occasion- I also suffer from mild MVP and occassional panic attacks) I'm 33 yrs old; 6ft; 168pds. Otherwise healthy. My question is when I finish running on the treadmill my heart rate is usually only about 90 after three miles at a reasonably fast pace. I'm not that winded; but my legs hurt. I recently started running again to hopefully reduce my blood pressure and get off the atenolol. Shouldn't my heart rate be in the 140 zone in order to get full cardio benefit? Is this the Atenolol that's affecting my exercise rate? What's the point in running if I can't get my heart rate up? I'm positive the Atenolol effects my resting rate because before I started taking it it was 60 and now it's usually around 45.Any suggestions to maximize my cardio workout while taking Atenolol? I'm too young to be letting this drug interfere with my life. I'd rather be off it. Though the doctor pescribed it mainly for the pvcs and occasional tachycardia due to the panic attacks. Thankyou for you're help.

467,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Ellen on August 06; 1998 at 11:57:47: Hello; I just read an earlier message about not discontinuing atenolol abruptly. I have breathing trouble and chest pain; the cause of which has yet to be diagnosed. I was put on atenolol when I complained that my heart rate seemed to go up when I would stand up (I have ""reduced cardiovagal function""). The atenolol helped that. However; the breathing problem and chest pain continue. Well; I have a new pulmonary doctor and he suggested stopping the atenolol. He said that can sometimes cause make breathing worse. Also; he has retested me to see if I have reactive airways; which now it seems I do test positive for. Now I'm taking meds for that for a few weeks to see if it helps at all. I was taking atenolol 50 mg once a day. The pulm. told me to take 1/2 pill for a few days and then stop. He told me if I start feeling bad to start taking it again. I took 1/2 pill for 3 days; then stopped. Began to feel aware of the heartbeat again. It's faster; too. I guess I was excited about the thought that I'd get rid of the atenolol (I always wondered whether I really needed it all all - I can endure a fast; pounding heart as long as I know it's not dangerous. No one ever suggested it was dangerous.) I'm thinking that without the atenolol; maybe the airways meds will have a chance to work better. But have I perhaps discontinued the atenolol too abruptly? Should I talk to my internal medicine doctor about it? Should I be monitored in any way; now that I'm not taking the atenolol? I've just moved to a new city and have a new round of doctors; with whom I am very pleased so far. I've been trying to get a diagnosis for my breathing problem for so long now; and finally I'm getting a truly fresh look; starting from scratch. So; I don't want to ruffle feathers by asking one doctor about the other doctor's instructions about the atenolol; unless I truly need to. If I do ask; how should I approach it? You can probably gather that I tend to walk on eggshells around my new doctors as my naturally assertive manner has not enamored too many of my former doctors to me!! But if I shouldn't let these questions slide and this is important to be following up on; I won't be doing anyone a favor by being quiet.

Thank you for any suggestions; Ellen -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Ellen; Topic Area: Heart Disease There is no exact science to stopping beta blockers (such as atenolol). Stopping them abruptly can cause ""rebound tachycardia"" that is a increase in the heart rate. For most people this rise in heart rate is not dangerous. I think that the method your doctor gave you for stopping the medication is fine. If you want to extend it you could take a quarter table for an additional 3 days.

My BP shouldn't be high but it still is....however I have horrible anxiety; I freak out so easily.

Now I'm on day 4..and I feel more anxious than before I started and my BP was 143/80 again : ( I am going to keep taking it for a while longer; but I plan to see the doc about this.

472,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 50 year old male; who in July was ided as having secondary hypertnesion 230/130.I have had a heridity hypertension issue since I was 23 which was managed to normal levels with a single dose (50 mg) of beta blocker Tenormin (Atenolol). Since July I have been placed on the following medication; Norvasc (10mg) daily;Rampiril (20 mg) daily;Atacand (16mg) daily Tiazac (360mg ) daily Tterazosin (6mg) daily and spironliactone (25 mg) daily as well as 81mg of aspirin and although I do not have a cholesterol problem I am taking Crestor (10 mg).I have had EKgs; Echo cardiograms; which have indaicted no blockages although a small valve problem; which has not been considered to be a root cause of the BP issue.I have also had Doppler imaging of the kidneys which confirm no renal artery issues and substantial blood work which confirms no adrenal gland issues.Also have had to wear the 24 BP monitor three times which confirms the BP high throughout a 24 hour period. Presently with all the medications the BP remains at 190/120.My specialist has indicated that he feels that stress is a contrbuting factor; as I am employed in a high stress job with a major financial company and has recommended a short trem disability to determine if being away will cause the BP to go down.Although I am not adverse to this; I would apprecaite any additional plausable medical issue that may be root cause. My situation is being closely monitored and I do feel I am getting good care/treatment;however; I am concerned that this could lead to something bigger ie; a stroke if I can not get this under control.

Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - MTR on May 26; 1999 at 14:20:54 Dear Colin; thank you for your question. From the information you've provided; I'm worried that you may have coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is also called atherosclerosis and causes blockages to form in the coronary arteries. These blockages can limit blood flow to the coronary arteries to cause chest pain during periods of stress (exercise or high blood pressure). A family history of premature CAD in relatives younger than 55 years old; diabetes; high blood pressure; smoking; and high cholesterol levels all contribute to the development of CAD. Your BP is too high and needs to be aggressively lowered to around 130/80. Your cholesterol levels should also be checked and high levels should be treated. An ECG treadmill stress test is the standard version of a stress test where you exercise on a treadmill while your BP; heart rate; and ECG are continuously recorded. A thallium stress test goes one step further by imaging blood flow to your heart with a radioisotope called thallium during an ECG stress test. A thallium stress test is more accurate than a routine ECG stress test. After you receive your thallium results; you should ask your cardiologist about further procedures that may be indicated; how your BP will be treated; and whether you need to take a cholesterol lowering medication. I hope you find this information useful. Information provided in the heart forum is for general purposes only. Only your physician can provide specific diagnoses and therapies.

475,Atenolol+hypertension,: : I take Atenolol 100 mg daily. Everything is fine with this. I am going to buy a treadmill (with a Polar heart rate monitor) and exercise daily for 30 min or so with my pulse at; say; 120. I'm worried that the Atenolol will effect my heart rate increase due to exercise. In other words the Atenolol will prevent a normal increase in rate. Should I be concerned. : : PS: my BP in normal; I have no other medical problems etc : -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- : Dear Doug; : I have several questions for you. Why do you take the atenolol? What is you resting heart rate? What is you concern if you are unable to reach your target heart rate? Hello Doctor: I'm age 57 and have been taking Atenolol for a long time (maybe 20 years or so) to treat mild :) hypertension which was I think about 150/105 when I started the drug (other drugs had no effect at that time). My resting rate is 68. I guess my main concern is that I might be 'in danger' if I exercise to hard when the Atenolol is trying to prevent the heart from speeding up. Your answers here have been reasurring. I won't worry so much about the heart rate but will exercise and keep at a COMFORTABLE level. I think I'll buy a basic treadmill; without heart rate monitor; that way I can spend extra on the construction of the machine.... Cheers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Doug; Thank you for the clarification. There is no danger to exercise while on atenolol. Good luck and don't let you treadmill turn into a clothes rack. I hope you find this information useful.

476,Atenolol+hypertension,"Because I was having some problems with ""Atenolol"" after taking it for about one year (hot flashes; difficulty with achieving and maintaining an erection; drowsines); my Doctor switched me to ""Cardura"". She explained to me that it was an Alpha-blocker but explained little else. I had been on 100mg of Atenolol. She is now easing me off of the Atenolol. I am taking 75mg for three days; 50mg for three days; and 25mg for three days; after which I will be done with the Atenolol. Today is the first day that I am on 50mg's and I have also taken my first dose of Cardura (2mg). It caused me to become short of breath; tired; made me irritable; and gave me a headache. Is this because I am taking the combination of the two drugs? Is this a reaction to the Cardura? If so; is there another Beta-blocker that might not have the side effects of Atenolol? I have also read that blood count must be monitored when taking Cardura. She said nothing about this.

477,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By CCF CARDIO MD-APS on March 26; 1999 at 18:10:27: In Reply to: atenolol question posted by Jay on March 24; 1999 at 10:42:00: Im on 50 mg. atenolol at night. Also take Nubain ( nalbuphine hydrochloride ) for sleep/headaches; and am on testosterone therapy. My blood pressure has stayed the same ( 132/84 in the morning; 150-170/86-105 in the evening ); but my heart rate ( resting ) has dropped from 84 to 60 in a month or so so I suppose it is working. Can you see any possible interactions with my meds? I asked my Doc and he says no but for some reason I dont think he was listening. Thank you. Jay Dear Jay; There are always potential drug interactions in any person on multiple medications; and it really is patient dependent since it is the individuals liver and kidney that break down and excrete the drug. There might be some concern that the testosterone therapy is causing the elevation in blood pressure (levels above 140/80 are generally unacceptable; i.e. represent hypertension.) Don't know much about Nubain (not a drug we use in cardiology very much.) It really is an individual thing; i.e. what drug combination is best and safest for you; in order for you to be safe; if the same physician is not prescribing all three medications; they each need to be aware of what other medications you are on in order to assess what is the right drug for you. Atenolol is one of those drugs that has few if any interactions and I agree it is working if you resting heart rate is 60bpm. To check yourself; go to a medical library or just ask your doctor to let you see the PDR; physician's desk reference and look up under Nubain; the section called drug interactions. Your local CVS or Rite Aid pharmacist would also be able to discuss such potential interactions with you. I hope this information is useful.

478,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is 80 years old with a history of coronary artery disease; high cholesterol and hypertension. 12 years ago she underwent a CABG x3. She had a recent angiogram and the graffs are in good condition. Her hypertension over the last year has gotten worse. currently her bp runs around 178/76. She is currently on 50mg Atenolol and 160mg of Diovan and her bp is still not therapeutic. I should also add that she is unable to tolerate an ACE. She has been on the ARB for 2 months and it has made her very tired and weak. I am a nurse and have experience with hypertensive drugs. I would like to see her off the Atenolol and on 80 or less Diovan; Norvasc and a diuretic. Is there any reason why she should remain on the Atenolol? When I spoke to her MD about the Norvasc he thought it was a good idea. Jokingly; I said; ""her next complaint will be swelling in her legs."" he said; ""I'll just add a diuretic.""

479,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By chris on March 14; 1999 at 14:27:00: I joined a fitness program last November. Because of my age (48; female) I had to have an exercise stress test done on the treadmill. I take 25 mg atenolol daily for episodes of moderate hypertension. The technician continued the test until my heartrate was at 140. He was surprised that I could go that high without any symptoms. He gave me a target heart rate of 120-140. The evaluation gave me a cardiovascular rating of ""very good to excellent"". I find that when I exercise I have no problems at all until I get my heart rate up to 120. At that point it seems that I can only exercise for about 10 minutes; making me wonder if the treadmill test wasn't run long enough. After about 10 minutes I have to cool down or I become short of breath and nauseated. I told my doctor about this and he said that the dose of atenolol I was taking was very small. I should just not exercise as hard. My question is; shouldn't a person who has an overall cardiovascular rating of ""very good to excellent"" be able to exercise longer than 10 minutes at the lower end of her target heart rate? Could this be an effect of the atenolol? Can I expect to see an improvement if I keep working at it?

Everything is fine with this. I am going to buy a treadmill (with a Polar heart rate monitor) and exercise daily for 30 min or so with my pulse at; say; 120. I'm worried that the Atenolol will effect my heart rate increase due to exercise. In other words the Atenolol will prevent a normal increase in rate. Should I be concerned. PS: my BP in normal; I have no other medical problems etc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Doug; I have several questions for you. Why do you take the atenolol? What is you resting heart rate? What is you concern if you are unable to reach your target heart rate? Hello Doctor: I'm age 57 and have been taking Atenolol for a long time (maybe 20 years or so) to treat mild :) hypertension which was I think about 150/105 when I started the drug (other drugs had no effect at that time). My resting rate is 68. I guess my main concern is that I might be 'in danger' if I exercise to hard when the Atenolol is trying to prevent the heart from speeding up. Your answers here have been reasurring. I won't worry so much about the heart rate but will exercise and keep at a COMFORTABLE level. I think I'll buy a basic treadmill; without heart rate monitor; that way I can spend extra on the construction of the machine.... Cheers I hope you find this information useful.

483,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; as I said in other posts; I'm newly diagnosed with hypertension; and this week started taking Atenolol (25 mg. 1x / day; which; I understand; is a fairly low dose.). I take a baby aspirin at night (81 mg). I notice 'soreness' in upper body area when I do that; but I was told to do so and told it wouldn't interact. Also; I am prescribed cabergoline (Dostinex) for a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) at .25 mg. every other week. I'm currently on a trial of stopping that drug; but may have to return to it. I also have an rx for Ativan; but the atenolol makes me pretty mellow; so I don't see using that at all. Anyone have similar profiles or conditions? Anyone know of any interractions to any of these meds with atenolol? My pharm and doc say no; but just doublechecking.

484,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation for as long as I can remember and have routine echos and take Atenolol daily. I have not had an echo in several years and been having some chest pain for the last couple months. I had an echo this week and was told that my mitral regurgitation was moderate and also had some mild tricuspid regurgitation. RV was mild enlarged and pressure was 37mmHg so mild pulmonary hypertension. I was overwehlmed with all this news. My cardiologist did not seem to concerned said my 2.5 cm right ventricle was slightly out of normal range and the 37mmHG was just over. Should I be concerned and get a second opinion? Also what is causing this high pressure? Is the mitral regurgitation causing this? I would appreciate any advice.

486,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi all! I am a 22 year old college student...200 lbs and 8% bodyfat; great shape etc. I eat a nearly flawless diet and low sodium; all that jazz. Despite this; my BP has always been around 140-150/70!!! I get extremely nervous during tests and when they check my BP. In the office my BP was 175/80..a new record! My PCP put me on 50mg atenolol..claiming that my hypertension is anxiety based since I'm such a nervous person. I HATE ATENOLOL!! I used to be a great athlete..but I can't run good at all now! Also my heart rate was 60..now it's 40!! I felt dead..so I now take only 25 mg. This still makes me feel sluggish...I feel so old at only 22. HERE IS MY THEORY! When I'm not nervous- my BP has always been great (125/70). Unfortunately; I'm nervous all the time. I also get depressed and have no idea why..it's been messing with my relationships for years. In someone like me...a beta blocker makes me feel awful and more depressed..PLUS I can't workout! Going to see a new doc...and I really think I could control my pressure with an ACE-I and then an SSRI to control my anxiety. BTW I'm going to med school next year...so I'm about to get A LOT more stressed! I appreciate the help...should I switch to ACE-I + SSRI? I know a lot of docs use SSRI's to deal with stress; I figure a low dose might help me since I seem to have general anxiety very badly,2009,2009,,Male,hi i 22 year old colleg student200 lbs 8 bodyfat great shape etc i eat near flawless diet low sodium jazz despit bp alway around 14015070 i get extrem nervous test check bp in offic bp 17580a new record my pcp put 50mg atenololclaim hypertens anxieti base sinc im nervous person i hate atenolol i use great athletebut i cant run good also heart rate 60now 40 i felt deadso i take 25 mg this still make feel sluggishi feel old 22 here is my theori when im nervous bp alway great 12570 unfortun im nervous time i also get depress idea whyit mess relationship year in someon like mea beta blocker make feel aw depressedplus i cant workout go see new docand i realli think i could control pressur acei ssri control anxieti btw im go med school next yearso im get a lot stress i appreci helpshould i switch acei ssri i know lot doc use ssris deal stress i figur low dose might help sinc i seem general anxieti bad

The cough is my biggest worry about developing or maybe even now having cancer; have you heard anything about the correlation of cough to cancer? ___________________ dear Kay; I tend to agree with your assessment that treatment of the esophageal reflux is the obligatory step to improve your health and overall sense of well-being. If you have failed medical treatment (and it sounds as if you have); then surgery should be considered. There are laparoscopic procedures fundoplication procedures to treat esophageal reflux. Before; committing to surgery; it is necessary to document the degree of reflux and to exclude esophageal motility disorders that may worsen with fundoplication. An esophageal motility study with 24 hr pH probe study should determine the potential benefits and risks of fundoplication. You should be aware that excessive obesity is a relative contraindication to a laparoscopic procedure. This information is presented for educational purposes only. Always consult your personal physician for specific medical questions.

Regular exercise helps control weight and lower blood pressure. Don't be afraid to be active exercise should definitely be part of your daily program. Besides helping to reduce your risk of heart attack; it can also help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Statistics show that many people who have high blood pressure are also overweight. If you are overweight or have gained weight over time; you'll be advised to cut down on calories and lose weight. Your doctor can prescribe a diet that's right for you. If you're given a diet; follow it closely; including any recommendations about reducing your consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic drinks are high in non-nutritious calories; so if you're trying to lose weight; avoid alcoholic beverages. Often when people lose weight; their blood pressure drops as well. How does medicine help control high blood pressure? For some people; weight loss; sodium reduction and other lifestyle changes won't lower high blood pressure as much as it needs to be lowered. If that's your situation; you will probably need to take medication. Many medications are available to reduce high blood pressure. Some get rid of excess fluid and sodium (salt). Others relax constricted blood vessels. Others prevent blood vessels from constricting and narrowing. Because there is usually no cure for high blood pressure; treatment generally must be carried out for life. If treatment is stopped; the pressure may rise again. Doctor and Poster: What is NSAIDS?

498,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently bought a blood pressure cuff to use at home as my blood pressure varies and I have occasional panic attacks. I am on 50mg of Atenolol (1/2 morning; 1/2 evening) and .5 mg Clonazepam 2x a day. I run 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I have noticed that my heart rate is usually around 42-45 during the day and my hands are always cold; especially in cold temperatures. I assume this is due to the Atenolol; but am not crazy about this side effect. My question is this: My blood pressure is usually around 135/80 when I measure it first thing in the morning. At night when I get home from work it's usually 122/73. Is everyone's Blood pressure higher in the morning? Also somtimes my blood pressure will be higher- around 142/88. Should I be concerned? I am a 33yr old male; 6ft; 160 pounds; and in fairly good shape. I have a slight heart murmer and slight leakage of the mitral valves; but my cardiologist said nothing to be concerned about. How much does Atenolol reduce blood pressure? Shouldn't mine be lower with the Atenolol if I'm healthy? I would like to lower my dosage if possible with my doctors supervision; but am worried this may increase my blood pressure. My doctor says I am taking Atenolol for Atrial Tachacardia- usually brought on by panic attacks - and not for hypertension. Before taking the Atenolol I was told my blood pressure was relatively normal-though sometimes high due to white-coat hypertension.Neither of my parents have high blood pressure; or heart problems. Can you answer any of these questions? Also when I am measuring my BP The first beat I hear Is the Systolic but for an accurate diastolic reading do I record the last audible beat even if it's very slight; or the last beat that's reasonably loud. I'm not quite sure which is more accurate.,1999,1999,,,i recent bought blood pressur cuff use home blood pressur vari i occasion panic attack i 50mg atenolol 12 morn 12 even 5 mg clonazepam 2x day i run 3 mile 34 time week i notic heart rate usual around 4245 day hand alway cold especi cold temperatur i assum due atenolol crazi side effect my question my blood pressur usual around 13580 i measur first thing morn at night i get home work usual 12273 is everyon blood pressur higher morn also somtim blood pressur higher around 14288 should i concern i 33yr old male 6ft 160 pound fair good shape i slight heart murmer slight leakag mitral valv cardiologist said noth concern how much atenolol reduc blood pressur shouldnt mine lower atenolol im healthi i would like lower dosag possibl doctor supervis worri may increas blood pressur my doctor say i take atenolol atrial tachacardia usual brought panic attack hypertens befor take atenolol i told blood pressur relat normalthough sometim high due whitecoat hypertensionneith parent high blood pressur heart problem can answer question also i measur bp the first beat i hear is systol accur diastol read i record last audibl beat even slight last beat that reason loud im quit sure accur

500,Atenolol+hypertension,My 63-year-old mother; in overall good health; has been having a very low pulse rate. Sometimes; it has dropped to 39! The is the second time this has happened to her in the past 4 or 5 years. The first time; it was due to blood thinner medication. This time; the doctor's are not sure. She has been taking Atenolol for the past 3 years or so; and never had a problem. Her blood pressure was always borderline-high (ie...150/80). However; along with a very low pulse rate; the bottom number of her blood pressure reading has been in the 50's! Of course I am very concerned; but her blood work and EKG came out normal. She will be having a 3-day heart monitor in the near future. Any ideas what may be causing her very low pulse rate and blood pressure. Any suggestions on what specific tests she can do to find out about any problem(s)? Thank you.

501,Atenolol+hypertension,HI! I have been on Verapamil; and gained weight from that. I was also on nadolol; but the heartbeat was still forceful. I asked to go on atenolol (10 mg in the AM and PM) since it helped my mom for the same thing. It is very noticeable and i have a hard time sleeping from this! I recently went to a health and nutrition store...as I read the good effects of Hawthorne Berry on the heart.. I took that; but not at the same time as atenolol. My heartbeat is worse then ever and sooooo strong and uncomfortable! I won't go off the heart meds until I can slowly cut down. Does anyone have suggestions as to what I should do? No insurance becasue of layoffs; so this is hard. Heart tests as of last fall (2008) were normal.

The Doctor advised me to continue taking the Avapro + HCT. Since being on all of these medications my pulse has been regulated from 150bpm to between 68bpm and 88bpm and is regular and strong. I have no chest pain. My blood pressure however has dropped from an average of 120/86 to a minimum of 95/56 and an average of 98/64 with a pulse rate averaging 76bpm. I feel light headed and quite weak; and this is at rest as I am not back at work yet. I suspect it could be the actions of the Atenolol and the Avapro+HCT together lowering my blood pressure too much. My question is; can I stop taking the Avapro + HCT and simply continue with the other medications to hopefully raise my blood pressure slightly without increasing the risk of another infarction or tachycardic episode? Thank you.,2007,2007,,,hello doctor five day ago i diagnos interior infarct i 47 yo male physic demand occup the doctor start plavix 75mg lipitor 20mg atenolol 25mg half 50mg daili i previous take avapro hct control hypertens the doctor advis continu take avapro hct sinc medic puls regul 150bpm 68bpm 88bpm regular strong i chest pain my blood pressur howev drop averag 12086 minimum 9556 averag 9864 puls rate averag 76bpm i feel light head quit weak rest i back work yet i suspect could action atenolol avaprohct togeth lower blood pressur much my question i stop take avapro hct simpli continu medic hope rais blood pressur slight without increas risk anoth infarct tachycard episod thank
508,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; My mother is 56 old. She is on Atenolol 25mg; Analetin 5mg(not sure of the spelling); and Zantac (She used to be on Nexuim). Within the last few month she is been having accelerating blood pressure in the evenings. Her pressure goes from 105/65 to 185/150 in minutes. It happens randomly 3-5 times a week usually between 6-10PM. Her pulse could anywhere from 65-95 during the attacks. Her doctor gave Clonidine to control the pressure during the attacks. The attacks have been increasing in frequency. She had CT scan of her kidneys and adrenal glands and they were clean. It is a mystery to us and her doctors. I am afraid if could a condition is getting worse everyday and could be too late by the time we find out the real condition. If anyone has come across such a condition or has any suggestions; we would appreciate your help.,2008,2008,,,hello my mother 56 old she atenolol 25mg analetin 5mgnot sure spell zantac she use nexuim within last month acceler blood pressur even her pressur goe 10565 185150 minut it happen random 35 time week usual 610pm her puls could anywher 6595 attack her doctor gave clonidin control pressur attack the attack increas frequenc she ct scan kidney adren gland clean it mysteri us doctor i afraid could condit get wors everyday could late time find real condit if anyon come across condit suggest would appreci help

511,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi everyone Is heat intolerance the last symptom to go away when treating hyperthyroidism? Could it be something else besides hyperthyroidism? About 3 years ago I developed uncontrollable hypertension and some tachycardia. Only atenolol (up to 200 mg/day) was able to control it; although making me very weak; sleepy and depressed. Then blood tests revealed it was all caused by T3 hyperthyroidism. 2/10/2015 Free T3 5.09 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) high Free T4 1.21pg/ml (0.93-1.7) normal TSH 2.67 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) normal Antimicrosomal antibodies 15.95 IU/ml (less than 34 IU is considered negative) Low testosterone is said to continue until I no longer use Atenolol or Propranolol. On physical examination the Endocrinologist said he felt the thyroid gland is enlarged. After 6 weeks on 20mg/day Tapazol (Methimazole) Free T3 4.79 pg/ml (2.0-4.4) still high but less than before Free T4 0.92pg/ml (0.93-1.7) borderline low TSH 5.09 uIU/ml (0.27-4.20) high Blood pressure is now much better controlled; almost using no Atenolol. But heat intolerance got worse. Is this normal? The endocrinologist kept me on 20 mg/day; next blood test scheduled for 5/14/2015. Because of my former hypertension and tachycardia he wants my free T3 to get into normal range (to prevent a heart attack or stroke) despite what happens with TSH and Free T4. He said me might try lowering Tapazole dosage once Free T3 gets back to normal. Will heat intolerance go away once my free T3 gets into normal range? Why am I responding so slow to Methimazole? Might it be because only my free T3 was high so now my free T4 is now low; so little reverse T3 is formed.,2015,2015,,Male,hi everyon is heat intoler last symptom go away treat hyperthyroid could someth els besid hyperthyroid about 3 year ago i develop uncontrol hypertens tachycardia onli atenolol 200 mgday abl control although make weak sleepi depress then blood test reveal caus t3 hyperthyroid 2102015 free t3 509 pgml 2044 high free t4 121pgml 09317 normal tsh 267 uiuml 027420 normal antimicrosom antibodi 1595 iuml less 34 iu consid negat low testosteron said continu i longer use atenolol propranolol on physic examin endocrinologist said felt thyroid gland enlarg after 6 week 20mgday tapazol methimazol free t3 479 pgml 2044 still high less free t4 092pgml 09317 borderlin low tsh 509 uiuml 027420 high blood pressur much better control almost use atenolol but heat intoler got wors is normal the endocrinologist kept 20 mgday next blood test schedul 5142015 becaus former hypertens tachycardia want free t3 get normal rang prevent heart attack stroke despit happen tsh free t4 he said might tri lower tapazol dosag free t3 get back normal will heat intoler go away free t3 get normal rang whi i respond slow methimazol might free t3 high free t4 low littl revers t3 form

Having chest pain and shortness of breath. EKG in ER was normal; chest xray normal; cardiac enzymes neg. Referred to us for a nuclear stress test and the patient was put on atenolol; ranexa; and imdur. However; non compliant with the imdur because of headaches. A 2 day protocol was used. The patient walked 11 minutes and reached 13.4 mets. 95% to his target heart rate. The patient was short of breath and had chest pain. The Ekg did not really show anything significant. The nuclear images were negative other than the RV showed up prominently on the stress study. An echo showed neg but had 3 small leaky valves. Why would the RV only show up on the Stress imaging. No lung uptake was seen. NO TID levels increased and no Lung heart ratio increase. My concern are we overlooking something. I have some ideas of the cause but I am not for sure if these are correct.,2013,2013,,Female,i 46 yo male known cardiac risk factor state may hypertens past unsur no med have chest pain short breath ekg er normal chest xray normal cardiac enzym neg refer us nuclear stress test patient put atenolol ranexa imdur howev non compliant imdur headach a 2 day protocol use the patient walk 11 minut reach 134 met 95 target heart rate the patient short breath chest pain the ekg realli show anyth signific the nuclear imag negat rv show promin stress studi an echo show neg 3 small leaki valv whi would rv show stress imag no lung uptak seen no tid level increas lung heart ratio increas my concern overlook someth i idea caus i sure correct
517,Atenolol+hypertension,Healthy 150 lb age 61; shaken when I had 1st recorded AFib Nov ’07 (after dental surgery) causing me to go on 25 mg. Atenolol (taken late evening) & aspirin ( already on Lisinopril keeping BP under 140/80). Appears Atenolol not good . All Dec light headed & had occasional Afib. Jan fainted one morning after awakin w/ low BP 90/58 after a night of AFib episode ( I was urinating frequently). Hindsight: totally stressed out. After the fainting; cardio ruled out plumbing/ valve.While off atenolol at hospital (stress test had to be done while not on blocker); I threw 2 pretty good 10 min AFib episodes heart pounded. Again I was sleep deprived & anxious.Jan 16 two lead pacemaker implanted (set to spark below 50 & record beat over 170). In addition to adding Coumidin; they were going to put me back on 25 mg of Atenolol & increase its dosage or switch me to stronger drugs as needed. And w/ pacemaker they have a record of my heart.. I asked that they try lopressor (Metoprolol) instead ( Bp drug on before I was switched off to Lisinopril). Since going to Metoprolol & taking in AM & sleeping 8 hours & trying to avoid stress; very little afib (my 45 day pacemaker recording (reviewed for the first time yesterday) shows one 2 minute mild Afib episode. The pacemaker has not had to spark or record high reading.. I not waking all night urinating. I am not waking up AM with low bp. I still from time get a weird feeling in my head (like interference) and worry Memory is not as fast at retrieving…..maybe my magination. Very gratefull so far AFib seems to be in check….fingers crossed. My /optimistic ?

518,Atenolol+hypertension,I have mild MVP and had all the EKG's; Echo's; Holter and Event Monitor's galore. Always been told my heart is fine. When the MVP first started in my early 20's it was just Sinus Tachycardia. The older I have gotten the more PVC's have come ( I am 35). First it was ocassionally; now they are coming in a series and when they come one right after the other they feel more like flutters like it cant catch up and I feel nasueaous (not like the normal thud); but I have not felt faint at this point and it has shown my heartbeat to be irregular on blood pressure monitor but blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Once again told they were benign and my heart is fine. Put me on Atenolol 25 mg a day...told me I can increase if I need to; but it seems to me that this beta blocker makes me sleepy and depressed lowers my blood pressure and now I wonder if the slowing of the heart rate is not making my skips worse. Should I increase my atenolol; stop my atenolol or should I try Magnesium. I have heard alot of people say that Magnesium has helped them. If I do stop taking the atenolol I know you are not supposed to stop all together how should I wean myself off of it; again I take 25 mg a day...sometimes I even skip a day.,2007,2012,35.0,Female,i mild mvp ekg echo holter event monitor galor alway told heart fine when mvp first start earli 20s sinus tachycardia the older i gotten pvcs come i 35 first ocassion come seri come one right feel like flutter like cant catch i feel nasueaous like normal thud i felt faint point shown heartbeat irregular blood pressur monitor blood pressur heart rate normal onc told benign heart fine put atenolol 25 mg daytold i increas i need seem beta blocker make sleepi depress lower blood pressur i wonder slow heart rate make skip wors should i increas atenolol stop atenolol i tri magnesium i heard alot peopl say magnesium help if i stop take atenolol i know suppos stop togeth i wean i take 25 mg daysometim i even skip day

521,Atenolol+hypertension,"Had concerns about ""funny"" feeling once in a while; like skips or flutters in heart. Had been told on 2 most recent visits to Urgent Care for virus symptoms and then to quick check before cataract surgery by nurse that I had a heart murmur. I saw a cardiologist. He put me on 25MG Atenolol and after doing a Echo he added Diovan 80MG. My blood pressure has never run high--only put on Atenolol as my pulse rate on 1st check was 118. When I went for Echo a month later blood pressure was 125 over 85 and pulse rate was 58. No problems found with Echo---he can hear a very slight murmur but nothing to be concerned about. He wanted me to add 2nd med and come back in about 3 months. I asked about side effects and Dr. stated very little side effects. After seeing on bottle of Diovan that it may cause dizziness I checked on line & see it is for high blood pressure. I did not take this medication.

My PCP & cardiologist initially Rx'd weight loss; stimulant avoidance; Aspirin 325mg & Atenolol 25mg/day. All labs values were normal. 24-Hr. Holter showed NSR except for 1 palpitation x 2-3 minutes.

This last reading - peak RV systolic pressure 8.5 mmHg > RA pressure - apparently is below the normal range of 20-30 mmHg. Can you tell me what could be the causes/implications of this low reading?

On the beta-blockers I may have developed Peyronie's Disease; so the doctor took me off of the beta-blockers last week. I was on atenolol 25mg; once a day. He told me to stop the beta-blocker cold turkey and take an ACE Inhibitor. The ACE Inhibitor is keeping the blood pressure normal; about 118/78. But the heart rate is 85 to 110 when sitting. Mostly it's 80 and 90's when sitting; but sometimes it hits 100 or more. The heart feels more rapid when up moving around and doing things.

Six months ago I had a strange episode where I felt sudden chest pain/pressure with sweating which lasted approximately 10-15 minutes and slowly subsided. I had an EKG done a few days later which was within normal limits. Because of symptoms; a stress thalium test was done which was inconclusive. A cardiac cath was then performed; which did not show any blockages. So; it was decided to continue treating the hypertension with atenolol. I do not understand why I continue to have these strange heartbeat episodes; and if there might be something wrong. I am a 53 year old female in otherwise good health.,2007,2007,,,sever time i experienc strang heartbeat sensat it like combin feel like heart beat irregular also beat fast it happen i check blood pressur puls bp 168108 wpuls 116 i treat mild hypertens last year atenolol diastol pressur low mid 90s my son lqts check negat result test ekg six month ago i strang episod i felt sudden chest painpressur sweat last approxim 1015 minut slowli subsid i ekg done day later within normal limit becaus symptom stress thalium test done inconclus a cardiac cath perform show blockag so decid continu treat hypertens atenolol i understand i continu strang heartbeat episod might someth wrong i 53 year old femal otherwis good health
529,Atenolol+hypertension,I had hypertension and was under medication for that. Then I had comprehensive cardio checkup in April 1998 at the age of 47.

I have consulted both doctors; Cardio-Medical and Cardio-Surgeon who said that there was no medication for dilated aortic root and no hurry in getting surgery at this size. As per their advise I am taking three medications as mentioned. As I live alone at work without my family most of the time; I’m bit worried about it. The doctors did not prescribe ARB.

530,Atenolol+hypertension,"42 yr old woman...5 weeks pregnant...(this will be my 4th child) I have been taking atenolol for approx. 8 yrs. - prescribed to reduce ""skipped heartbeats"" which caused anxiety/panic attacks. When first given dose was 25mg each day. OB/GYN that I have scheduled an appointment with (have never been seen by him) said that ideally he would like me off the atenolol since it is not for hypertension. I have low blood pressure (averages 102/60 most of the time). I did see a cardiologist 4 yrs ago (holter/ekg/echo)..all good...some pvcs...but nothing unusual. Tried to stop the atenolol in the past...3/4 of a tablet for 1 week; 1/2 tab for a week; then 1/4 tab for a week. It went well but 6 weeks later the skipped beats came back; more flutters; feeling shaky afterward and of course anxiety about it all! Started the atenolol again (1/2 tab) and things settled down(this has been about the last 3 yrs). Stopped the atenolol 2 days ago and today I had episodes of skipped beats (10-20/hr)... don't get so panicky about it anymore since I visited an anxiety specialist (fyi; I never had an anxiety or panic attack until I had an episode of skipped beats and palpitations) Also had the stomach flu yesterday with a fever ( 99-100)! My questions... 1. Is there a good way to discontinue the atenolol? 2. Is discontinuation the better choice while pregnant? 3. Is there a better(safer) beta-blocker to use when pregnant? 4. The increased skipped beats could be the result of being sick and pregnant rather than my stopping the atenolol; right? 5. Should I request to re-visit the cardiologist when I see the OB/GYN so they are in sync?

531,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'am a long time sufferer{17 years} of PVC's who's had all the non-invasive tests including a ""normal"" thallium stress test. With the basic understanding that at least some arrhythmias are caused by some type of cardiac problem such as CAD etc at what point does one request more invasive testing testing like cathierization{sp} to rule out blockage? I mean if I were to explore ablation shouldn't one positively rule out all root causes before a procedure like ablation is undertaken? Also I'll ask you to speculate; the docs on this forum have often stated that PVC's can be associated with hypertension or a result of it. Do you think this is because high BP in some way effects the heart to precipitate the PVC's or is it that the type of person who is prone to high BP {""type A""; etc} is also prone to PVC's? And why then when BP is controlled to normal levels do PVC's not stop? I realize these last couple of questions likely have no real answers just wondering what your intuition leads you to believe.

532,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi; Im 27; 250lbs; 5'-11"" and I work out about 5 days a week; mostly cardio jogging and Anaerobic sprinting. My max heart rate usually is about 172; but I try to keep it about 160. I dont have any issues with workouts; no pain; nausea; dizziness; etc. My resting pulse is about 50-60. I was diagnosed with hypertension about 5 years ago; and Ive been on a slew of medication since then; however my system never seen to adjust. Last year; I thought I was having a heart attack and went to a local hospital's ER; only to be admitted for stress testing; an echo; and some testing where I was in a CT scan tube for about a half hour following the stress test. All items came back normal and I was sent home immediately. I was recently put on 25mg of atenolol in the afternoon for BP as well as 5mg of amlodipine; and 20mg benazepril. I also take medication for anxiety. Anyway; my pulse has dropped to 45-50 during the evening hours and sometimes I get dizzy or get palpatations for minutes. Im really worried about having an arrythmia or other cardiac condition and would like advice. Would the previous cardiac testing I have done noticed a cardiac condition such as an arrythmia or bradycardia? I assume the bradycardia is from the atenolol. when I dontn take the atenolol; my heart beats very hard; I can feel it in my chest; however my pulse is 50-60. Im not sure if this is a concern. Is there anything I should be asking my doctor or doing? Im really worried that my heart will stop or that I have an underlying issue.

Normal heart rate for me is about 120 to 130 upon any little exertion it jumps to 180 to 200 sometimes it feels like my heart is goig to pop right out of my neck it is so strong and the thumping becomes painful in my neck. My gp put me on atenolol; had stress test done and cardiologist said heart was strong didn't know what was causing heart to race; but it was definitely abnormal before we even started it was at 143. Said was not hypotensive and didnt believe I needed atenolol; went back to gp; said this is ridiculous was still have chest pain and heart was racing at 145; must slow it down he said. So I've been on atenolol now for 4 months;helps to some degree but has not gone away. Last couple months been experiencing numbness in left arm and quite a bit of chest pain. Rest makes it better. I have iron defieicency anemia hemoglobin is at 8.8 level for last 7 months. Is it possible that the anemia is causing this problem. Or if you have any ideas; could you please advise. Is my gp right in putting me back on atenolol when specialist said;no. And can this harm me in any way? thanks so much for your time. Any response would be a help. It all gets pretty confusing.

540,Atenolol+hypertension,For anybody on that med...I just went from taking Atenolol; 50 mg; 2 x a day for..oh geez 15 years at least; to taking the metoprolol. Same dosage..50 mg 2x. I was having LOTS of palps; and the dr felt that the Atenolol just wasnt working so much for me anymore. I started just this past Friday ( 07/24). I know the brochure I got with it; says it can take time to get into my system. But...one thing when I was on the Atenolol...my heartrate very very rarely EVER went out of the 60s. Even when I was active. Oh; sure; if I climbed stairs it would rise up; sometimes near 120 tops; but it fell right away too. I also never felt my heart beat; or pound a bit...EXCLUDING the times when I was having palpitations..of course I feel it then..but when Im just relaxing; I didnt feel it. ALSO...when on the Atenolol; i could even skip a dose..and my heartrate would stay down. Now..on this new med...gosh; if its even fairly close to the time that my next dose is due; and I; say; take a flight of stairs; or make a couple trips carrying heavy groceries; my heart is beating pretty fast. I timed it at 132 bpm; after I carried some groceries in ( its a rather long walk..heavy bags). I dont LIKE this new med; I dont think!! I want my HR to always be nice and low like it was on the Atenl!! But then; maybe im not giving it a chance? Its only been 4 days that ive been on it. I have a follow up appt with the Dr at the end of August..he wanted me to give this medicine about a month..then come and see him.

543,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi...I'm a 32 year old female 5'3 & 130 lbs. I've had to take Atenolol for about 8 months. I was put on this med when my BP skyrocketed to 175/118 (I was also sent to the hospital). I have no high BP in my family; weight is normal and I'm too young for this. My doctor attributed my high BP to the Effexor I was taking. I just switched to Wellbutrin and have read that this will also cause a rise in BP. Should I be worried about this? Or will the Atenolol keep working (it also helps with my anxiety). I just don't know what is better...go off the AD and be miserable or take the Atenolol and worry that I'll have a stroke one day.

547,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 42 year old male and having Hypertension since the age of 32. I have tried several Beta Blockers & ACE Inhibitors in the past 10 years. I used to change the medication every 2~3 years when they were found ineffective. Following is a list of medicines I have consumed in the order : Atenolol; Lisinopril; Enalapril & Bisoprolol. Recently when my BP was at a rate of 170/110; my doctor prescribed following medicines : Metpure XL 25 (Metoprolol 25Mg) & Arbitel-H (Telmisartan 40Mg). Now the BP at a controlled level.

550,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi people; I have anxiety disorder and hypertension; this both diagnosed and treated. I have some control now with my panic attacks and extreme anxiety; but the problem is not that; I just tell you that just for you to know some priors; 3 days ago I started to experience some kind of numbness in my right hand fingers (the first 3 starting from the right). Not completely numb or non sensitive but some kind of strange numbness; the rare thing is that I've been having this sensation for the entire day. Now I don't know if this might be because of any of the medication I use to take (Paxil; Xanax; Atenolol; Losartan) or if it's there another cause. Basically what worries me more is that it keeps the feeling and now is 3 days and counting. Any advice will be welcome. Thank you.

I then couged up blood; had chills; was lathargic with weight loss and no appetite; with 104 fever. I was admitted to the hospital; diagnosed with vasculitus; (limited wegner's vasculitus in sinuses) within days; following this reaction. Recently I discovered that the warnings on Atenenol say; to never stop Atenenol suddenly; due to harmful reactions. Vasculitus is on the list of possible reactions form Atenenol; in looking over the MEd-web. Is this a fact; that stopping Atenenol suddenly is very likely the cause of the vasculitus?

558,Atenolol+hypertension,I wake up from a deep sleep to a normal; sinus rhythm. The heart rate is typically in the 70's. If I take a deep breath or get up; my heart pounds and the rate jumps well over 120 BPM. This typically last just for a few minutes. I understand adrenaline and cortisol are at play; but I sense there's a rush of these molecules for some reason. It doesn't happen at any other time. And I wouldn't worry at all except for the fact that the four times I've had atrial fib it was spawned by this rapid rise in heart rate after waking and at no other time. How can I control this so it doesn't happen; other than beta blockers?

560,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CCF Physicians; In order to control blood pressue can a calcium channel blocker such as Norvasc also be added to the following daily medications: Altace(10mg); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg)? Or; is the calcium channel blocker taken instead of one of the above medications? Would changing the time of day a person takes their medication have any effect on blood pressure control? For example would it be better to take the altace(10mg); atenolol(50mg); and hydrochlorothiazide(25mg) all in the morning or would it better to take only the beta blocker and diuretic in the morning then take the ace inhibitor at bed time? I am just looking for different ways to better control my blood pressure. It seems I am at the target dose of the initially mentioned medications: beta blocker; ace inhibitor; and diuretic and still are somewhat hypertensive at times. Thus wondering what effect adding a calcium channel blocker; such as Norvasc; may accomplish. The rise in blood pressure; the systolic; is of concern. What typically used to be 120-125/70-72 has started to creep up to systolic pressures in the 145-155 range with little or no change of the diastolic pressure. It seems as I age; presently 64; isolated systolic hypertension is beginning to appear as it did with my parents.

561,Atenolol+hypertension,For the past few months I've been experiencing a lot of pressure and a throbbing; pulsing feeling in the back of my head (at the base); my neck; and the same pressure and pulsing feeling in my eyes; but its usually one eye at a time. Laying down usually makes it worse; unless I lay in just the right way which is new every time. I've read a lot online and everything says its pressure; stress; anxiety; or tension; but I honestly don't think its either. I've put hot rags and other things to relax my muscles; but that never seems to make a different. It never happens at a stressful time in my life either. Last time it happened was on vacation! My neck also starts to feel wobbly; like my head is too heavy or something. I'm really starting to worry; its almost as if there is excess fluid in the back of my head or something; if that makes any sense. But every time it happens; one of my eyes is also affected. It gets to where all I can do is close my eyes to make the pain somewhat go away. Does anyone know what this could be? Every part of me is telling me its NOT a tension/anxiety thing. Part of me thinks its more sinus related than stress related.. But I haven't had any sinus problems lately and I'm still feeling it. Anyone know what I'm describing? Oh and just some background info: I have been diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and I'm on atenolol for it.

564,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 24 year othersise healthy male. Recently I was diagnosed with mild LVH and hypertension. This may be due to the following facts that have occured in past 4-5 years; unhealthy lifestyle; unhealthy eating; 30-35 lbs of weight gain; etc. My doctor thinks due to these factors I might have had mild and borderline high bp resulting into LVH. Is this a fair assumption? Right now; I am taking Atenolol 25 mg per day which seems to be helping. My question is with a proper care; and proper lifesyle; can I bring back my heart to normal? Can I reduce the BP and not have to be dependent on medicine for rest of my life?

565,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 46 yr old female; severely overweight. On 50 mg atenolol 2x daily; for mild-moderate hypertension. Have had benign palps for 15+ years. Have had all the tests-including a Thallium stress test ( about 7 yrs ago) and a holter as recent as 7 months ago. I have been told over the years that my palps are stress related; and am on Lexapro; and Xanax used as needed-I have GAD and panic attacks. My palps came back a year ago after being gone for a long time. After an ER visit; where I was put thru blood work; monitors; Chest xrays; etc ( this was about a year and a half ago) I was sent home being told all was fine. Iam pretty much sedentary--my job is an 8 hr desk job-I do come home and do housework--but no exercise on a daily basis. My question--I am trying to lose weight now. I have been ( for about 8 months now) taking the stairs DOWN ( no; not up..not yet) when I leave work each day. Thats 8 flights of steps. Then a walk to the car which is usually the length of a city block. When I get to the car; Iam winded-my pulse ranges from 95-113 when I first get in the car.( thats with the Atenolol). It drops within a minute or two; back to my normal range; which is upper 60s; low 70's. I have noticed that the palpitations really fire up; immediatly after I sit down. After the steps and walking stops. I do not notice them during the steps and walking. On the drive home; my palps are firing pretty good. I keep thinking; this is the time my heart will just stop. Should I stop taking the stairs down? Its something Ive done for quite a while...and have had the palps. I have off and on every day.,2007,2008,,Female,i 46 yr old femal sever overweight on 50 mg atenolol 2x daili mildmoder hypertens have benign palp 15 year have testsinclud thallium stress test 7 yrs ago holter recent 7 month ago i told year palp stress relat lexapro xanax use neededi gad panic attack my palp came back year ago gone long time after er visit i put thru blood work monitor chest xray etc year half ago i sent home told fine iam pretti much sedentarymi job 8 hr desk jobi come home houseworkbut exercis daili basi my questioni tri lose weight i 8 month take stair down upnot yet i leav work day that 8 flight step then walk car usual length citi block when i get car iam windedmi puls rang 95113 i first get car that atenolol it drop within minut two back normal rang upper 60s low 70s i notic palpit realli fire immediat i sit after step walk stop i notic step walk on drive home palp fire pretti good i keep think time heart stop should i stop take stair it someth ive done quit whileand palp i everi day

568,Atenolol+hypertension,"Im 38 yr old female. Up til recently had very low BP; 90's/60's. Then; out of the blue; started getting dizzy and really bad headaches; and chest pains. At 16; was diagnosed with MVP. I work at a school; so I went down to have BP checked; it was 140/94. IT kept going up; after a week of getting it checked; I went to my FP. He checked it it was 155/110. He put me on Atenolol 25 mg. that didnt work so he increased it to 50 mg. I was sent for echo; which they found; mild mitral valve regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. I had the stress test; holtor monitor; kidneys checked. They were all okay. My father had heart disease and his mother did also. My question is ""IS this a progressive thing?"" Are the HBP and the valvular disease correllated? Or is a seperate issue? Im trying to make sense of this? I get this pulsating in my neck; and pounding in my chest alot. I was told its nothing to worry about. Its very uncomfortable feeling!

569,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

571,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had an echocardiogram. The conclusions from the cardiologist report are left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 75%. Evidence of early diastolic function. Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. I am age 60. I would appreciate some feedback on this. I have high blood pressure and take Lotrel and hydrochlorthiazide.. I am considering a beta blocker if the doctor insists. The cardiologist told me the results were not bad; but heart is slightly stiff. I know that is diastolic dysfunction. Are there meds for that condition?

572,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a healthy 25 year old guy. I'm very physically active. I run 2-3 miles 5 times a week and lift weights as well. Hypertension runs in my family. I am currently taking 7.5mg Enalapril and 25mg Atenolol a day. This keeps my hypertension at bay. Typical readings are 120-138/80. I've had blood tests; cholesterol is great; blood sugar is fine. Last year I had a Stress+Echo (November 2009). Everything came out normal. I've had PVCs as long as I can remember. My concern is i'm a lot more aware of them now; and they typically occur with exercise. I notice them sometimes after i've done a set on bench press; or after i've run a couple of miles. I don't get a lot of PVCs in a given day (maybe 2-5 that are symptomatic). I probably am aware of PVCs say 3 times a week. Stress/Worry/Thinking about PVCs exacerbates them. Do you think I have anything to be concerned about? The stress+echo last november showed I have a perfectly healthy heart. Due to being concerned about this; I am scheduled to see a cardiologist next Friday. Could I go into V-Tach or even worse V-Fib and die? Do you think I should have an echocardiogram and holter monitor?

I am 26 and have been having IST along with headaches pain kind of where my gallbladder used to be but a little more towrd the center of the top of my stomach and wierd brown spots that are showing up pn my arms and chest and even legs biggest being about the size of an eraser. My heart rate went up the day the pain started and has not come down. without a beta blocker it is around 90's sitting the second I put my feet down to stand up it goes to to the 120+ comes down and goes up with minimal work. I know these are symptoms of IST but I wanted to see if you think this could be a pheo. I know they are very rare but do happen. if it was just the heart rate I wouldnt question it but with the head aches that I never got before and the pain the blood pressure going up even on the beta blocker over heating and the new cafe au lait spots could this be a pheo or only IST what else should I be tested for it they think it is IST...

How comes I can feel this comming? And since I have had heart examinantions; and nothing was wrong; how can I reduce my palpitations. I must say that I don't smoke or drink coffee; or even chocolate; but they still are to much. When they come in triplets; It scares me each time again.

579,Atenolol+hypertension,Please feel free to read my other thread in this forum for a detailed history of my anxiety problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night.,2009,2009,29.0,Male,pleas feel free read thread forum detail histori anxieti problem my recent issu i wake middl night elev puls skyrocket within moment wake i went back cardiologist thursday told ekg show thicken heart muscl she review echo two year ago told show sign thicken well i went cardiologist hope allay health anxieti wors im bit mif doctor didnt keep inform go echo all i ever heard valv leak bit abnorm amount age 29 im go new echo monday ill stress test soon the stress test scare ive got stay atenolol 48 hour hand ill deal puls elev probabl wors incid heart race im look reassur anyon give hope someon similar i feel healthi im deal stuff everi night
580,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had a consistent bp reading of 154/96 and above for several months now. I have been on diuretics but they have made no difference at all. I am due another visit to the bp clinic on the 27th of this month. If this reading is the same then I am to go on another medication and Atenolol (sp) was mentioned. I must admit to being a little concerned about all this as the nurse mentioned to me several side effects. Are there cases where the tablets work without any effects? If I am unlucky enough to be one of the people who get side effects; are there alternatives? I honestly thought that the diuretics would be enough and I am upset at the thought of taking these drugs long term. One other question. My bp is considered to be hereditary as my mother suffers from hypertension and my father died of a massive heart attack. My daughter is now 30 years old. Should she be considering being monitored?

583,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question regard to the medication call Atenlol. I am 32 yeasr old female; and have several people who's got high blood pressure in my family (all Asian). I was diagnosed as High blood pressure couple weeks ago. I had my nose bleeding for couple of days after my dental surgery the other day. Right before the oral surgeon put me on to sleep; he said my blood pressure was very high; and asked me if I am taking any medication for this. The surgeon ignored my high blood pressure since I never had high blood pressure in my life; and thought probably because I was nervous. (it was 178/148 that day) For 4 days after the surgery; my nose bleed in the morning everyday. I thought it was caused from my dental surgery so I went to see my family doctor. My doctor thought that nose bleed is nothing to do with neither my dental surgery nor my high blood pressure. She thought the high blood pressure was caused by my anti-depression,2007,2007,,,hello i question regard medic call atenlol i 32 yeasr old femal sever peopl whos got high blood pressur famili asian i diagnos high blood pressur coupl week ago i nose bleed coupl day dental surgeri day right oral surgeon put sleep said blood pressur high ask i take medic the surgeon ignor high blood pressur sinc i never high blood pressur life thought probabl i nervous 178148 day for 4 day surgeri nose bleed morn everyday i thought caus dental surgeri i went see famili doctor my doctor thought nose bleed noth neither dental surgeri high blood pressur she thought high blood pressur caus antidepress

I am currently taking Atenolol 50 mg; Felodipine 10 mg and Maxzide 25 mg; and have yet to be controlled for more than 2 months (lower than 140/90). I also am taking Colestid 4 gr x 2 day for High Cholesterol (HDL 59; LDL 153). In 1995 I was admitted to a German hospital with a BP reaction to prescribed Motrin; whereupon I was tested with: 24 hour BP check; ECG; abdominal ultrasound; stress test and a Farbdoppler ECG; with no out of ordinary results. I have recently been tested again with a renal ultrasound and 24 urine test for a renal tumor with negative results.

586,Atenolol+hypertension,I have several questions concerning HDL. The last two times I have had my lipids tested my HDL has been quite low (TC 226; LDL 145; HDL 35; trig 225 and after dietary changes; exercise etc. TC 193; HDL 26). 1) I just recently attended a lipids workshop and the cardiologist mentioned a drug called Niaspan that is supposed to lower LDL; raise HDL; and lower triglycerides. I got the impression that this is a new drug and does not have the side effects that taking niacin can have. Is that true? 2) In the literature we received it said that beta blockers (I take 25 mg atenolol daily for questionable hypertension) can lower HDL. I never had my HDL measured before starting atentolol so I don't know if it has had any effect on my HDL level. 3) If I understand it correctly; the statins work by lowering the LDL. Yet Lipitor claims in its advertisements to raise the HDL as well. Is is worth taking this drug mainly to raise the HDL? I'm not sure what my LDL Is now; the second test I had was just a screening but I would think it would probably be a bit lower than the 145 it was the first time. Thank you Chris Smith,1999,1999,,,i sever question concern hdl the last two time i lipid test hdl quit low tc 226 ldl 145 hdl 35 trig 225 dietari chang exercis etc tc 193 hdl 26 1 i recent attend lipid workshop cardiologist mention drug call niaspan suppos lower ldl rais hdl lower triglycerid i got impress new drug side effect take niacin is true 2 in literatur receiv said beta blocker i take 25 mg atenolol daili question hypertens lower hdl i never hdl measur start atentolol i dont know effect hdl level 3 if i understand correct statin work lower ldl yet lipitor claim advertis rais hdl well is worth take drug main rais hdl im sure ldl is second test i screen i would think would probabl bit lower 145 first time thank chris smith

589,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia; left arm weakness and tingling sensation; irregular periods and suffer from anxiety/occassional panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG and low phosphorus. Not sure if this plays any part in thyroid issues as well. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!,2008,2010,,Female,hi i 34 yo femal suspect i may thyroid problem i er sever time recent chest pain new dx hypertens atenolol tachycardia left arm weak tingl sensat irregular period suffer anxietyoccassion panic attack i great shape work 23 timeswk tgchol normal dont smoke rare drink alcohol i mention primari dr possibl thyroid problem order bloodwork consist t4 total 72 tsh 099 i know number within normal rang shouldnt i test like free t3 free t4 thyroid antibodi is possibl ro thyroid problem test t4 total tsh also test i recent done show elev rf high igg low phosphorus not sure play part thyroid issu well ani feedback great appreci

598,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 36yo male who is looking for a bit of advice. My liver is inflamed and has been for some time; the last 3 L.F.T. results have showed rapid increase in G.G.T. levels and I am seeing my Doctor tomorrow (Public Holiday today) to get the result of the 4th L.F.T. The Doc said if the 4th L.F.T. is any worse he is referring me to a Liver disease specialist. Last night after cooking dinner I got a huge dizzy spell and went blind for 1-2 seconds and at 2am while I was trying to sleep in my air conditioned bedroom (AC set to 20 Degrees C) I suddenly felt as if the room went up to over 50 Degrees C and immediately began to sweat profusely and felt like my heart was going to explode and I had difficulty breathing. This only lasted about 15-20 seconds but it was quite frightening. I got up and chugged a glass of lemonade and went back to bed. The episode repeated itself at 4:30am and I got up and had a drink again. I will be discussing these weird symptoms tomorrow with my doctor; but I am looking for advice on if this issue could be related to my liver issues or could it be something else. I am a smoker for 24 Years (since 12yo) and have been trying to quit for the last 3-4 years.,2015,2015,35.0,Male,hi i 36yo male look bit advic my liver inflam time last 3 lft result show rapid increas ggt level i see doctor tomorrow public holiday today get result 4th lft the doc said 4th lft wors refer liver diseas specialist last night cook dinner i got huge dizzi spell went blind 12 second 2am i tri sleep air condit bedroom ac set 20 degre c i sudden felt room went 50 degre c immedi began sweat profus felt like heart go explod i difficulti breath this last 1520 second quit frighten i got chug glass lemonad went back bed the episod repeat 430am i got drink i discuss weird symptom tomorrow doctor i look advic issu could relat liver issu could someth els i smoker 24 year sinc 12yo tri quit last 34 year

600,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 23 year's old. I recently began to have extreme trouble with dizziness (about 3 months ago) and was told I had high blood pressure. They put me on Lisinopril. I ended up in the hospital a month later (Christmas Day) with chest pains. They then told me they thought the Lisinopril was to blame. They took me off Lisinopril and put me on Atenolol. The Atenolol (over the course of a couple of weeks) lowered my pulse rate too much and started causing my heart rate to become irregular. I ended up back in the hospital where they took me off of the Atenolol and put me on Hydrochlorithiazide. Unfortunately; it too seems to be disagreeing with me; and we still haven't figured out what the cause of it all is. I'll occasionally wake up in the middle of the night; sometimes right after I fall asleep; with a sudden jerking feeling and a need to breathe which usually raises my blood pressure bad. This would lead me to believe I had sleep apnea or something similar; but this doesn't always happen; and the majority of the time; my blood pressure is bad during the day as well. They've done numerous blood tests; thyroid tests; heart and kidney ultrasounds; elecrocardiograms; ran nuclear stuff through my blood stream and tracked it through an MRI; done chest x-rays; stress tests; and hooked me to heart monitors. So far; everything turns up fine according to everyone. I'm still having heart pains; irregular heart beats; bad dizziness; and my blood pressure runs high almost daily.I've been living off of grilled chicken salads with no dressing and drinking water for the past three months; but even a switch in diet doesn't seem to have helped. I really hope I can figure this out soon. My blood pressure this morning was 126/110... the bottom number being the highest it has for some time; while the top was actually low for once. However; the pulse was also 110; and I was only laying down still sleeping just moments before I checked it. I also had an irregular heartbeat once again.,2010,2010,23.0,Male,im 23 year old i recent began extrem troubl dizzi 3 month ago told i high blood pressur they put lisinopril i end hospit month later christma day chest pain they told thought lisinopril blame they took lisinopril put atenolol the atenolol cours coupl week lower puls rate much start caus heart rate becom irregular i end back hospit took atenolol put hydrochlorithiazid unfortun seem disagre still havent figur caus ill occasion wake middl night sometim right i fall asleep sudden jerk feel need breath usual rais blood pressur bad this would lead believ i sleep apnea someth similar doesnt alway happen major time blood pressur bad day well theyv done numer blood test thyroid test heart kidney ultrasound elecrocardiogram ran nuclear stuff blood stream track mri done chest xray stress test hook heart monitor so far everyth turn fine accord everyon im still heart pain irregular heart beat bad dizzi blood pressur run high almost dailyiv live grill chicken salad dress drink water past three month even switch diet doesnt seem help i realli hope i figur soon my blood pressur morn 126110 bottom number highest time top actual low howev puls also 110 i lay still sleep moment i check i also irregular heartbeat

604,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctors; I am a 31 year old woman with a pacemaker and poorly controlled atrial arrhythmias. I am currently taking atenolol 25mg day and frankly find it doing a better job with my migraine headaches than with my heart. So I am essentially stuck on it. I am concerned that in the past my echocardiograms were normal and now I had one just recently that showed that I had mild pulmonary hypertension with right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. I also have a moderate tricuspid valve insufficiency. All of these findings are new. AND with exertion over time I have noticed that I get extremely short of breath. I get depressed knowing that I have so much difficulty just trying to climb a couple stairs. I do have some sort of connective tissue disorder that has not been clearly diagnosed yet. But my key interest is with my pacemaker. I am on my second. The first one was a dual chamber single lead that turned out to be very useless and causing me more problems. So I was upgraded to a dual-chamber; dual-lead; pacer--the left in the old wire so now I have three wires in my heart and two of them going into my ventricle. I am not sure if the pacemaker could be contributing to my new heart findings. However; despite all this; my doctor's office (Internist) never informed me of the new echo findings (I requested the echo on my own volition through my internist. I was told in the past that another echo would be unnecessary). I am very disappointed and have begun to wonder if I should just give up pursuing this. Any feedback would be very appreciated.,2002,2002,,,dear doctor i 31 year old woman pacemak poor control atrial arrhythmia i current take atenolol 25mg day frank find better job migrain headach heart so i essenti stuck i concern past echocardiogram normal i one recent show i mild pulmonari hypertens right atrial right ventricular enlarg i also moder tricuspid valv insuffici all find new and exert time i notic i get extrem short breath i get depress know i much difficulti tri climb coupl stair i sort connect tissu disord clear diagnos yet but key interest pacemak i second the first one dual chamber singl lead turn useless caus problem so i upgrad dualchamb duallead pacerth left old wire i three wire heart two go ventricl i sure pacemak could contribut new heart find howev despit doctor offic internist never inform new echo find i request echo volit internist i told past anoth echo would unnecessari i disappoint begun wonder i give pursu ani feedback would appreci
605,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; First of all thank you for the advice! It is very much appreciated. I am a healthy 25 year old male; with the exception of being treated for hypertension. I am currently on 25 mg of Atenolol and 10 mg of Enalapril. My blood pressure is controlled; under 140/90. My concern is PVCs!!! They are driving me crazy. They tend to be cyclical throughout the year. Sometimes they are really bad; and for the past month they have been. Last year I had all the cardiac tests done. Echocardiogram; Stress+Echo; Stress Test and Holter Monitor. All checked out fine. The Echocardiogram was done 6 months ago. I remember the technician for the Echo saying my Left Ventricle Wall Thickness was around 10 or 11 mm; on the upper end of of a ""Normal"" range Left Ventricle Wall Thickness. My follow up appointment the cardiologist yielded no concerns. She felt like I did not need to see a cardiologist anymore. The thing is I lift HEAVY weights 3 times a week. Squats; Deadlifts; Bench Press....... For 5 sets of 5 reps as heavy as I can possibly lift. Lifting is very important to me. It is a great stress reliever for me; and I enjoy the results I see. I swear it has lowered my resting blood pressure. I also run 3 miles 3 times a week. All the doctors I have seen see no issue with me lifting weights. I never hold my breath (valsalva maneuver) when lifting. For the most part I have PVCs with exertion - running or walking around after sitting at my desk at work for an hour or so. Do you think the heavy weight lifting could have caused me to have left ventricle hypertrophy since I had the Echo 6 months ago? Are the PVCs with exercise/exertion a signal of this? I went to the cardiologist office last week and saw a nurse's practitioner. She did a resting ECG and checked my blood pressure. All were fine. She did not seem concerned. Should I have another Echo to make sure I do not have LVH? I am hopeing this is just anxiety and I do not have a structural heart issue.

606,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I've been taking a beta blocker for over a year now; at first I started taking it every day for about 8 months. Now I'm only taking it during the week; it does help me a lot to function like a 'normal' person. I do suffer from a bit of depression; but overall I'm generally a happy person. I'm a young man; mid 20s. I was prescribed this medicine by my local doctor and have been taking it ever since; I went to see a shrink shortly after but haven't been since. I don't take them on the weekends; and I've stopped taking them in the mornings because of constant tiredness at work. I only take half a tablet each day (25mg). My question is: am I causing long term damage to my body by taking this everyday? Suffer from severe social anxiety; I still suffer from the social anxiety when taking the medicine; except the blushing isn't as severe.,2008,2008,,,hi ive take beta blocker year first i start take everi day 8 month now im take week help lot function like normal person i suffer bit depress overal im general happi person im young man mid 20s i prescrib medicin local doctor take ever sinc i went see shrink short havent sinc i dont take weekend ive stop take morn constant tired work i take half tablet day 25mg my question i caus long term damag bodi take everyday suffer sever social anxieti i still suffer social anxieti take medicin except blush isnt sever

608,Atenolol+hypertension,Six weeks ago I had oral surgery for an abscessed tooth and shortly thereafter had angina for about a week. It has subsided completely at present. At the time of the angina bouts I saw my Dr who did a nuclear stress test. It showed some ischemia in the lower regions of the heart so he sent me to a cardioligist who has prescribed me atenalol while I wait for an ultra fast CT scan. My BP was 128/88 or what they called the 'high side of normal'. I am cautious about using drugs if there are alternatives. I am reading a lot of complaints from people with side effects; tiredness; depression; nightmares; etc on this drug. Are these people the 1-5% the drug company claim or is the problem more widespread? At the same time; I have devoured mountains of material on CHD and find an alarming difference of opinions between researchers and even between cardioligists themselves about whether beta blockers are a good step. 90% of research says beta blockers do nothing to prevent 1st heart attacks in people with angina. 10% of the research says they do prevent 1st heart attacks. Numerous cardiologists say they are lifesavers; while others say avoid them; or that there are more effective classes of drugs. The research does favor beta blockers for those who have had a heart attack and want to avoid a second one; but I have only had a brief spell of angina and am not getting them now so would rather work on the Ornish; Esselstyn plant based reversal plans drug free if I can. Is this wise or should I use the atenalol?

609,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

610,Atenolol+hypertension,I am on low doses of atenolol 25 mg.for mild hypertension 145/95. I will need to take Larium (Melfoquine) for malaria prophylaxis for 8 weeks. Are there any reports of untoward cardiac reactions when these drugs are taken together? I had a period of PVC's lasting for 8 months at 250 PVC's per day. One year ago I went back into normal rhythm and do not have any except for an occasional one. Thanks for any answer.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jim: Atenolol and mefloquine can potentially interact. Their concurrent use can cause abnormalities on the electrocardiogram; there are reports of cardiac arrest from simultaneous use of these drugs. In addition; mefloquine can cause extra heart beats (PVCs); while atenolol can suppress them. Using two or more medications simultaneously always raises the possibility of drug interactions. The risks of possible interactions need to be weighed against the benefits of the medications. This is something that is best done by your own doctor; who knows you and your medical history. Do not stop taking atenolol without consulting your physician; as sudden cessation of this class of medications can cause problems. If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a cardiologist. Information provided in the Heart Forum is for general purposes only.

611,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm on a low dose of Atenolol (25mg once daily) for a fast heartbeat. After eating a large meal my heartrate will be around 70-110 but feels faster because of the bad palpitations. Usually around 3 hours after that meal my heartrate will slow back down to 50-70 but the palpitations sometimes continue making me feel uncomfortable. Anyways; I just walked up my stairs and my heartrate went up to about 130 with very bad palpitations and I could feel and hear my heartbeat in my ear. This has happened before on morning afters of heavy drinking. It doesn't happen often but when it does it's pretty scary. I couldn't check my blood pressure when I went upstairs cause my blood pressure machine was downstairs. When I came back down and checked it it was good at 123/79 and heartrate was 57. In April of this year I had an echo done and it showed 2nd degree diastolic disfunction but normal size and ejection fraction and an ekg showed leftward axis. What would cause this hearing and feeling of my heartbeat in my ear; this time it was just my left ear. If you have any questions; please ask.

612,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. Blood pressure had been well controlled in the past with Norvasc 10mg 1x daily and Metroprolol 25mg 2x daily. However; most recently; experiencing high blood pressure since the Nephrologist switched the Norvasc to Lorsartan 100mg 1x daily. Readings have been in the mid 160's even in the 170's. In addition; the Metroprolol was discontinued (it wasn't really helping the heart palpations) and have been prescribed Atenolol 25mg 1x daily for the heart palpitations. Now; Dr is adding Nifedipine 30mg 1x daily to try and lower blood pressure. Is it okay to take Atenolol 25 mg 1x daily; Lorsartan 100mg and the Nifedpine 30mgs?

613,Atenolol+hypertension,"I totally can. I told my doc this and she said it was. I'm a 26 year old male; non smoker. The thing is; lately I've been feeling it go up and down quickly. It feels like an uncomfortable pressure in my head and chest with a slowing heart until my heart ""thumps"" and the pressure subsides. This happens quite often during the evening; usually when I'm standing up doing very little exertion. It doesn't happen as often when I'm laying down but it is still there. I'm coming off of a beta blocker (currently at 6.25mg...i'm very sensitive so I have to come off of it very slow). I'm on a low sodium diet (mostly whole foods) and I take a proton pump inhibitor. I suspect I may be low on some electrolytes. I had some blood work done last month but; for some reason; my doc didn't order an electrolyte test. I've been taking the PPI for probably close to 10 years now. Perhaps this is another explanation? Any ideas what I'm up against? This happened but to a MUCH lesser extent when I was at full dose (25mg twice daily) of atenolol. It never hurts but I'm forced to stop whatever I'm doing until it fixes itself. It's very uncomfortable and my heart will thump sometimes to fix it. It's not PVCs because the heart isn't stopping momentarily. I know what PVCs feel like. This happens to coincide when my heart gradually slowly down for a few beats before correcting itself back to the normal rhythm. Any ideas?

614,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old female with a pacemaker; that was placed about a year ago after a sinus node ablation. Now I am in A-Fib on/off all day. I now take coumadin; verapamil; metoprolol and tambocor. The meds. have never worked. My E.P. Dr. said he doesn't think meds. will work and says I need to choose between a new catheter ablation procedure; or an av node ablation. I am very symptomatic as well. I can't lay down at night without several pillows (can't catch my breath; and I feel like my head will pop there's so much pressure; and I have trouble exerting etc.) A recent echo. showed mild tricuspid regurg.; and mild mitral regurg.; also mild pulmonary hypertension; I can't remember what else). I also had a recent V.Q. scan (my internist ordered)because I get very sharp pains at times when I breath in. The result was low-probability. No follow-up after that. I also have a patent foramen ovale. My questions are as follows: A)Do you you have any ideas what would cause chronic a fib after a sinus node ablation? B)Do you have an opinion as to which procedure is best to teat A-Fib? My Dr. seems very confused about what to do. C)Also I'm wondering about what mild pulmonary hypertension may indicate; and should it be followed up? D) Does a low-probobility v.q. scan correlate to pulmonary hypertension? E)Should I tell my E.P. DR. the results of the V.Q. scan the internist did? I'm sure the rsesults are probobaly insignificant but none of it was explained to me so I'm a little curious.

615,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr.; I am f; 5'5"" and 125lb; and soon to be 47. I am in good health considering many diagnoses. I have had a little more than a few echoes. I was diag with mild mvp; mild mr; and mild tr. This last echo took place in the hospital this year and had an added element. It said mildly elevated pulmonary pressure. (I was admitted to hosp with L. shoulder and arm pain; and a coincidentally abnorm ekg. It turned out to be c-spine pain.) The cardio asked if I smoked; had asthma; pneumonia at any time; or severe case of bronchitis. The answer is ""no"" to all. Both my parents had emphysema late in life; neither smoked. Mom did have chronic bronchitis and later asthma; pneumonia a number of times. (Mom had 2 bypasses and a MVR and died of CHF). Dad worked with chemicals for printed circuitry; don't know if that means anything. We lived in front of a furniture factory that left paint all over surfaces in our yard and in the kitchen window. I gave that history to explain possiblities for the emphysema; because I wonder if it may be related to something here. Are there any further tests I should have for the PP?

616,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently visited a cardiologist in Miami; Florida after having severe intermittent chest pain over the past couple of years. I also suffer from pac's and pvc's and bouts of fast heartrate. I had a stress test and holter monitor done in 1987; everthing was completely normal and was assured not worry. After having a severe bout of pvc's/pac's in 1998; my doctor put me on atenolol 25mg twice daily which I must admit controlled the palpitations so well I almost feel cured. I don't suffer the side effects of most beta blockers for which I am grateful; mostly only nightmares. I decided to visit a cardiologist after suffering from severe attacks of chest pain; which my doctor diagnosed as costachondritis. The cardiologist did an EKG and an echocardiogram after I told him of my symtoms. He said my symtoms were not anginal and that my ekg and echo were normal besides showing marginal concentric left ventricular hypertrophy which was probably due to mild hpertension; usually 140/90 in the dr. office and 120/75 at home. I visited my internist who visits where i live every 4 months and gave a copy my report from the cardiologist. He did an ekg and said it showed no signs of hypertrophy and my report was essentially normal. The only other thing that was mentioned in the report was that I had no frank mitral valve prolapse; but that there was a redundant pattern of motion of the mitral leaflets. My question to you; do you think the hpertrophy that I have is of any clinical signifance or if i should get an repeat echo in another year and do you thinks the redundant motion of the mitral leaflets could suggest a mild mitral valve prolapse as i do present with most of its symptoms.

617,Atenolol+hypertension,Dr. Mark; Can you tell me what the symptoms are of Pheochromocytoma? My endo said that if my symptoms don't improve within two weeks we'd look into my hyperthyroid symptoms more to see if something else was going on (I'm on methimazole and atenolol). I have a lot of symptoms that coincide with pheochromocytoma; however; my b/p is 80/60 on the atenolol; and the only headaches I get are the everyday headaches. I had an abdominal CT scan about a year ago that was negative for appendicitis. I just feel like I have adrenaline surges that go through my body and they can occur when trying to sleep or just watching tv. I have a very hard time believing that this is from anxiety.

618,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have noticed recently (over the past few months) that I have been acting oddly. First of all; I find myself having to urinate frequently. This usually occurs during school but sometimes in the evening as well. It is not everyday that I feel like this. Yesterday; for example; I had to urinate 9 times between 8:30 am and 3:30 pm; however; today; I only had to urinate 3 times. In addition; I think that I have become increasingly moody; but; to be perfectly honest; I have always been known for my moodiness; so its a little bit hard to tell; lol. Now; today I went to the doctor to check up on my high blood pressure; which I seem to be doing more and more these days. She had me do a urine test; which came back as very high in sugar (I didn't ask what the number was.) When she pricked my finger; however; my blood sugar was low; 67; I believe. My doctor said that the urinalysis must have been inaccurate; but; given my symptoms; I am not so sure. Is it possible for me to be diabetic and just expel massive amounts of sugar through my urine? Oh; I almost forgot; I can feel when my blood sugar is low; and it doesn't happen very often. I could definitely feel that it was low when the nurse pricked my finger. Do you think that I should just ignore it or what? A few other odd symptoms: I randomly will find that a toe; finger; or maybe even a whole hand will become completely cold. It is like it is not even part of my body. It isn't numb; just cold. The feeling typically goes away after a while. I am noticing red; splotchy stops; especially on the front of my ankles. Is this related? Finally; I have felt tired a lot lately. Is this a part of it? Now I take atenolol; which is a beta blocker; for my hypertension. I am not sure how much of this is related to that. PLEASE give me your thoughts! I have another doctors appointment in a week and want to go in armed and ready! Thanks guys; Paul,2007,2008,,,hello i notic recent past month i act odd first i find urin frequent this usual occur school sometim even well it everyday i feel like yesterday exampl i urin 9 time 830 330 pm howev today i urin 3 time in addit i think i becom increas moodi perfect honest i alway known moodi littl bit hard tell lol now today i went doctor check high blood pressur i seem day she urin test came back high sugar i didnt ask number when prick finger howev blood sugar low 67 i believ my doctor said urinalysi must inaccur given symptom i sure is possibl diabet expel massiv amount sugar urin oh i almost forgot i feel blood sugar low doesnt happen often i could definit feel low nurs prick finger do think i ignor a odd symptom i random find toe finger mayb even whole hand becom complet cold it like even part bodi it isnt numb cold the feel typic goe away i notic red splotchi stop especi front ankl is relat final i felt tire lot late is part now i take atenolol beta blocker hypertens i sure much relat pleas give thought i anoth doctor appoint week want go arm readi thank guy paul

Little squiggles and lines; all moving and changing shape. When I closed my eyes I still saw these but in shades of gray! They lasted for several minutes and dissappeared.

621,Atenolol+hypertension,Two part medical questions : I have been treated for high blood pressure for last 15 years (was taking Atenolol-50 mg & Lisinopril-30mg). Recently; I was diagnosed with palpitations (PVC's) by a Cardiologist. (via EKG test) I was directed by this physician to start taking Atenolol (100MG) and Lisinopril (40MG) as treatment for the PVC condition. Assumption is that by lowering my BP it will eliminate or better control the PVC events. Does this sound appropriate? Since I'm very nervous and apprehensive when these PVC events occur (which probably drives up my PB even more!); would the additional use of Ativan (.05mg) or Celexa (20mg) help calm me while I deal with these conditions .... or would they conflict with current Hypertension medication?

622,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello all My doctor prescribed me Lisinopril 40mg when my blood pressure was 170/105 at hospital about 6 months ago. I had dizziness (electricity going through my brain feeling) and fatigue; hard time breathing before the doctor's visit; but even after the medication; the symptoms continued. But; my blood pressure was regulated to around 110/80. Then; slowly; my blood pressure started coming down even more to 100/80; 90/70; then 80/60. So Doctor told me to take only 20mg of lisinopril every day. I did. Then; even more serious headaches; dizziness; and feeling like fainting; and high blood pressure. So Doctor then prescribed Atenolol 25mg per day. One week of trial. Even higher blood pressure around 170/110. So Doctor then advised that I should take both Lisinopril 30mg in the morning; and Atenolol 25mg at night. This has been working quite well for few weeks; bringing my blood pressure to 100/60 almost every time I measured it. But; recently; I started having those peak moments where I would start freezing/trembling; severe headaches/dizziness; and my legs had no strength that I fell few times. My arms/hands felt like there was no circulation; that I coudnt even hold a drug bottle. Blood pressure around 165/110. Then; I took Xanax. This helped almost every time I had this happened to me. But; these days; those happenings where I would have crazy dizziness and weakness in all my body and my blood pressure going up skyhigh come to me more often. Everytime I take Xanax; it does help; but only temporarily. Doctor tells me that I am having panic/anxiety attacks; and the medications actually do work; because all that matters is the average blood pressure; not just few incidents per week. I feel like there must be some other hypertension medication out there that should get rid of these symptoms and get my blood pressure stable. Because when it's stable; I feel OK. These days; not. I have high blood pressure very often even with the medications... not the anxiety attacks... I don't know what to do. Doc tells me to stop worrying and keep my current meds; but I want to change them.,2010,2010,49.0,Female,hello my doctor prescrib lisinopril 40mg blood pressur 170105 hospit 6 month ago i dizzi electr go brain feel fatigu hard time breath doctor visit even medic symptom continu but blood pressur regul around 11080 then slowli blood pressur start come even 10080 9070 8060 so doctor told take 20mg lisinopril everi day i then even serious headach dizzi feel like faint high blood pressur so doctor prescrib atenolol 25mg per day one week trial even higher blood pressur around 170110 so doctor advis i take lisinopril 30mg morn atenolol 25mg night this work quit well week bring blood pressur 10060 almost everi time i measur but recent i start peak moment i would start freezingtrembl sever headachesdizzi leg strength i fell time my armshand felt like circul i coudnt even hold drug bottl blood pressur around 165110 then i took xanax this help almost everi time i happen but day happen i would crazi dizzi weak bodi blood pressur go skyhigh come often everytim i take xanax help temporarili doctor tell i panicanxieti attack medic actual work matter averag blood pressur incid per week i feel like must hypertens medic get rid symptom get blood pressur stabl becaus stabl i feel ok these day i high blood pressur often even medic anxieti attack i dont know doc tell stop worri keep current med i want chang

624,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am 48 yr old male with Juvenile onset Diabetis. About 6 months ago I had a brief spell of a-fib that caused a chain reaction of doctor visits; cariologist visits; tests that all came out normal. My cardiologist put me on metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice per day. Although he told me it was a benign drug I have many side effects including fatigue and drowsiness; some dizzyness; and loss of sex drive and ED problems. The side effects were really hampering my ability to function throughout the day. About 3 weeks ago i tapered off metoprolol of which my last dose was 1 1/2 weeks ago. everything went fine but now am having issues with blood pressure spikes; chest pains. tachy-cardia spells and dizzyness.

627,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor; about a week ago; has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range which has been successful. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

628,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 43 year old male; and have been on atenolol and lotensin for 7-8 years for hypertension and nagging PACs. Two years ago at my cardiologist's recommendation; I began taking 40 mg of Zokor (I have recently reduced it to 20 mg/day) since I have gotten regular readings of total cholesterol at 200-230; HDL 29-45; LDL 140-170. There is a history of heart attack on my mother's side (herself at 48 and her father at 39 years old). Tests from holter monitors; treadmills and echos indicate no signs of CHD in me yet. I am considering stopping the Zokor even though it is doing the job; because I swear it is causing my hair to fall out which is a big deal to me since I have always had a lot of it. My cardiologist says Zokor isn't the likely culprit. My question is this: Could Zokor and/or the other two drugs be contributing to the sudden thinning; and would it do any good to switch to a non-statin? I really hate taking so many medications.,1999,1999,,,im 43 year old male atenolol lotensin 78 year hypertens nag pac two year ago cardiologist recommend i began take 40 mg zokor i recent reduc 20 mgday sinc i gotten regular read total cholesterol 200230 hdl 2945 ldl 140170 there histori heart attack mother side 48 father 39 year old test holter monitor treadmil echo indic sign chd yet i consid stop zokor even though job i swear caus hair fall big deal sinc i alway lot my cardiologist say zokor isnt like culprit my question could zokor andor two drug contribut sudden thin would good switch nonstatin i realli hate take mani medic
629,Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping you will give me an opinion on this. I have had a lot of symptoms over the years that now suggest that I could possibly have Behcet's disease. I have an appointment with the rheumatologist I saw for similar problems (about 10 years) in February. I am a 49 year old premenopausal (as far as I know; tested last January) female; with a not so great lipid picture(TC 216 after much effort; LDL 145; HDL 26; Trig 225). My weight is normal; don't smoke; take 25mg atenolol daily for mild hypertension. Lately I have noticed what I believe could be angina symptoms and this has me concerned. When I walk uphill I get chest discomfort that goes into my neck and sometimes my left shoulder. If I slow down or walk on even ground it goes away. It never happens any other time (such as under stressful situations)and always happens when I walk uphill (although sometimes worse than other times) I joined a fitness program about a year ago (had to stop because I developed sacroiliac problems but I do walk 2 miles 4-5 times per week)where I had what was called a submaximal multilevel treadmill stress test. These angina symptoms did not happen during this test; which was declared normal. My question is that I have read that vasculitis of the coronary arteries can cause symptoms similar to angina symptoms. Since Behcet's disease is a vasculitis type disease; often with episodes coming and going intermittently; I am wondering if that could possibly be causing my symptoms that resemble angina. If so; does this still mean that the coronary arteries are not getting enough oxygen; or would angina symptoms from vasculitis not mean the same as angina symptoms from CAD? Thank you for your opinion. As I said; I have an appt with the rheumatologist and plan to discuss this with him.

630,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Physicians at Cleveland Heart Clinic; Is it unlikely to have angina like symptoms only at rest and never while jogging/running daily?

633,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I was recently diagnosed with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism and have been on Levoxyl(or something like it initially LOL) for over a month. Interestingly; my average blood pressure reading has significantly declined latley. It was borderline; 130's (sometimnes 140's) over 90's for last few years; but have now been getting readings in the 100's (systolic) with diastolic readings in the upper 60's. Last echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction and had me wondering if the thyroid replacement is causing the BP to fall? Is it possible the diastolic function will show improvement now? I have always been active; exercise-wise; but have recently also started to be even more active. Maybe it's because of that?

635,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had some 'interesting' symptoms of late; they seem to lean towards colon cancer; though it has been 'suggested' here that it could maybe be colitis [which though I don't believe; I don't don't either]. Before these symptoms; I was being investigated for kidney disease; all was clear; cystoscopy; scan [like the one they use on pregnant ladies] and an X-ray. Recently; I have been feeling slight pain in my right kidney area; though before I'd have described it as 'my top rib' and the pain comes as I sneeze; cough; pass a constipated stool; walk too far etc; but now; today; I have been asked to call in for blood tests; and I find the abbreviations slightly alarming considering all else what clear; so I wonder if you could help shed some light please? ::Clinical Details:: Stage III CRF ::Chemical Pathology:: LFT [and I think] UTE.

636,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 39 yr old female. At age 29 I was diagnosed with High Blood pressure & low potassium (had low potassium for a few yrs b4) Started taking Atenoretic 50 mg - 1 a day for blood pressure and potassium pills. 2-3 years later; I had swelling so they switched me to Atenolol/Chlorthal 50/25 - 1 a day. Each year my potassium has gotten worse. About 5 yrs ago they added Spironolactone 25 mg twice a day to help w/potassium. In the past yr my potassium pills have doubled (I now take 12 - 10meq potassium pills a day) we are having difficulty keeping my potassium above the ""low"" normal. My doctor tested for aldosterone and renin; both of which came back high. She sent me to an Endocrinologist who did a renal artery duplex test which came back normal. All kidney blood test have come back normal & no signs of diabetes. The Endocrinologist sent me back to my doctor; neither of which has ordered any more test or changed any meds. Basically endocrinologist is done w/me & my doctor said she’ll see me at my check up in March. My blood pressure has remained in control all these years and still is (113/68) give or take a few on each. I have high cholesterol -238. Not on meds for this. I did not take spironlactone for 3 days (kept forgetting to pick up at pharmacy) I had tingling in hands; legs & face along w/ chest pains) Once the medicine was in my system; all symptoms went away.

638,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 34 y.o. female and suspect I may have a thyroid problem. I have been in and out of the ER several times recently for chest pain; have new Dx of hypertension (now on Atenolol) with tachycardia and suffer from aniety/panic attacks. I am in great shape; work out 2-3 times/wk; TG/Chol normal; don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol. I mentioned to my primary Dr. about a possible thyroid problem and she ordered bloodwork consisting of only T4; total (which was 7.2) and TSH (which was 0.99). I know these numbers are within the normal range; but shouldn't I have been tested for more? Like the free T3 and free T4; thyroid antibodies? Is it possible to R/O thyroid problems with only testing me for the T4; total and TSH? Also; other tests I have recently done show elevated RF and very high IgG. Not sure if this plays any part in thyroid issues as well. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!,2008,2010,,Female,hi i 34 yo femal suspect i may thyroid problem i er sever time recent chest pain new dx hypertens atenolol tachycardia suffer anietypan attack i great shape work 23 timeswk tgchol normal dont smoke rare drink alcohol i mention primari dr possibl thyroid problem order bloodwork consist t4 total 72 tsh 099 i know number within normal rang shouldnt i test like free t3 free t4 thyroid antibodi is possibl ro thyroid problem test t4 total tsh also test i recent done show elev rf high igg not sure play part thyroid issu well ani feedback great appreci
639,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 38 year old female and have always had blood pressure of 117/74 or lower. The odd time it would be 120/80 but this was rare. For the last 4 days i've checked my pressure and it has been on average 129/76 (i check it very regularly at the drug store). I've very concerned that it is this high so quickly.

I had a stress test approximately 4 months ago and received the highest possible score of 7+ minutes walking at a fast speed. Is this something I should notify my Dr. about?

640,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP & heart rate; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. After having the baby I went to the new PCP again I've been seeing; and he did another EKG (Feb. '09). This time the EKG read non specific abnormalities in leads V4-V6... normal sinus rythym 90 BPM. The dcotor said the EKG was abnormal & I needed to see a cardiologist. How could the EKG's differe so quickly? What do the results mean?,2007,2009,,Female,i 28 year old femal mother 2 young kid after labor deliveri first child 6 year ago i develop high bp seem faster heartbeat i kind anxious person i attribut heartbeat i went pcp bp diagnos anxieti relat hypertens didnt think i need see cardiologist so i took atenolol switch toprol xl control bp heart rate seem i ekg 03 normal i told fast forward 2008 i found i pregnant 2nd child the obgyn i see put labetalol never refer cardiologist after deliveri babi i csection i lost lot blood ob doctor wouldnt give bp med day bp low while hospit heart rate got 144 one point i recent went new pcp old one left practic new one put back toprol xl hed perform ekg 08 i pregnant normal after babi i went new pcp ive see anoth ekg feb 09 this time ekg read non specif abnorm lead v4v6 normal sinus rythym 90 bpm the dcotor said ekg abnorm i need see cardiologist how could ekg differ quick what result mean

642,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking 25 mg of metoprolo a day (1/2 pill twice daily) just for some minor issues with PVCs. After several months I got hives and some food sensitivity that is evidently a side effect; so I decided to stop.

643,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 68 year old lady in formerly good health but now suffer from PAF which is increasing to the point where I had a four day stay in hospital a few months ago;but it then reverted on its own. Now I get approx a 3-4 hour episode every few weeks. I also take Valsartin for hypertension(Co-Diovan 12.5) for a number of years and this is successful. I was previously taking Atenolol for this; but was put on 10 mg daily Bisoprolol in the hospital; also placed on a Warfarin program. Some six weeks later I was taken off the Warfarin and put on a low dose daily aspirin. I wore a Novocor monitor for a week which showed transient AF but also bradycardia (about 42bmp) and the specialist recommended a possible pacemaker for this in the future. As my episodes increase; I have questioned such a high dose of Bisoprolol which I read can slow the heartbeat; ie one drug to slow the heartbeat and a pacemaker to speed it up? I had not been aware of any bradycardia prior to all this; but then I was undiagnosed with any brewing heart problems for several years I think. My surgery doctor has decreased the Bisoprolol to 7.5 and says we will wait to see the effect. My question is really about the suitability of Bisoprolol for my condition.

It is like a severe jabbing; it lasts for 5 to 10 seconds and during that time period.. my vision gets blurry. I have to stop from whatever i am doing; and stay still for a while either by taking support or by sitting on the floor. Last one month; i have been feeling really dizzy like in showers. My face gets pale; and i end up vomiting. During the last two two weeks; the sharp pain happens and then the headache gets constant. It is really painful; and just stays in one patch. I get severe nausea; and vomiting. It feels like my flesh is burning. Its like a tingling sensation. my whole head is perfectly fine; it's just one spot. And eyelids feel like they are droopy; and on fire. I have been taking painkillers and anti nausea medications; and nausea medicines makes me sleep otherwise i have trouble sleeping due to the headache. I sleep; and wake up after one hour.

645,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everyone I thought about a million ways to write my problem to be easy on the eyes; so I'll begin by my status. I Live in: São Paulo; Brazil (fairly Tropical weather) Gender: Male Age: 22 Weight: 154 pounds Height: 5' feet 7' Drink? No Smoke? No Exercise? Yes; regularly. 1st year medical student (started in UK going to finish in Brazil) Sexual Orientation: Straight Eating habits back in 2005: Junk food and regularly white rice with meat Eating habits back in 2006: Vegetarian (consumed fish) Eating habits back in 2007: Lesser junk food back to eat meat with white rice Eating habits back in 2008 to present: Vegetarian again but now I do not consume any rice at all; just more vegetables Take Any Medications? Yes; 25mg of Atenolol daily (began to take it in 2006) Hypochondriac? No Stressed? No Brazil has an outbreak for Yellow fever; Malaria and Dengue; but its not common in my city or its surroundings at all and I do not have it. Symptoms I am currently experiencing (with their respective year of discovery): - Hypertension (2006) - Hair loss everywhere in my body; but the top of my head was affected the most (2005 and I'm almost bald on top of my head) - Gall stones (2006) - Moderate Gastritis (2006) - Hepatic Steatosis (I do not drink any alcohol at all) (2006) - Bloating after eating (2005) - Sometimes I get diarrhea with very strong pain in the lower GI; right below the belly button (2005) - White Rice and junk food gives me cramps with diarrhea (present) Important exams I did: * Cholesterol: 20mg/dL LDL (Yes; I know; 20MG/DL LDL; how is that even possible!!) (2007) * HIV: Negative (december 2008) <- This was my greatest fear I'm glad I ruled that out * Hepatitis A: Negative (december 2008) * Hepatitis B: Negative (december 2008) * Hepatitis C: Negative (december 2008) * Rubeola or Measles: Negative and Immune (december 2008) * Toxoplasmosis: IgG 58.10 IU/mL / IgM 0.0 IU/mL (december 2008) * EKG: Normal (2006; 2007; 2008) * MRI of the neck down: Normal (2007) * Chest X-Rays: Normal(2006) * Ultrasound of the heart and other organs: Normal except for the abnormal finding of Hepatic Steatosis. (2006) * CBC (Geez; I did SO MANY CBCs that I lost track but every single one came out to be normal) (2005; 2006; 2007; 2008) * Colonoscopy: Small benign polyp was found and quickly removed; no other findings. (2006) * Vitamins levels: normal (2007) * Urine: Normal (Geez; I also did countless of of urine exam; so many kinds that I dont even remember anymore; even had to pee all day on a jar once) (2006) * Testosterone levels (total): 739.7 ng/dL (Normal: 241.0 to 827.0 ng/dL) * LH: 3.0 mUI/mL * ACTH hormone: 16.3 pg/mL (Normal: 0.0 to 46.0 pg/mL) * Prolactin: 7.5 ng/mL (Normal: 2.1 to 17.7 ng/mL) * Plasmatic Cortisol: Normal * Cardiac Enzymes: Normal * Thyroid exams (TSH; T4; etc; etc): NORMAL * Thousands of other exams that I already forgot: Normal * Glucoses: Normal levels (2005/06/07/08) * Endoscopy: Moderate Gastritis (2006/07) For a few months back in 2006 I suffered with bloody diarrhea; the blood was quite red and fresh; which indicated lower GI bleeding. That was the reason why I did a colonoscopy in the first place; no abnormalities were found at all besides a small benign polyp which was removed and analysed and determined benign. I am a very relaxed person; I do not suffer from any form at stress at all. Strangest part?! I share the same symptoms with my Father; my Brother and My cousin family. They all started to suffer from Gastro-Intestinal Disturbances / Hypertension / Hair loss; exactly like me. And around the same time as I started. And when I say gastro intestinal disturbances I mean so severe that once I was rushed into the ER with a very staggering pain in the lower GI (below the belly button); I felt as if I was getting stabbed with a knife (from 0 to 10 I'd say 9.5; the pain level); the pain did not go away and the doctors thought I had apendicitis at the time; I did an MRI from the neck down and it revealed that everything was normal; so I was discharged without any treatment besides Buscopan. Because my close relatives suffer from the same symptom I assumed it was infectious; but the CBC ruled that out. I am going to perform an exam this wednesday to check whether or not I am poisoned with a metal compound such as Barium (my town had a case of barium contamination in a place near the water supply). Been a few months that I been exercising regularly; it didn't change much besides slowing my heart rate. But I still feel palpitations which are VERY annoying; especially after I eat something. I dont even need to say that I been o thousands of doctors; right? And did THOUSANDS of exams to try to find a cause for my hypertension and NOTHING. I've been told I was Hypochondriac and that my symptoms are related to stress; and quite frankly I am very tired of hearing such a thing. My story is simply: One day I was normal the next I was shitting blood; loosing hair and hypertensive. I was not stressed or depressed before or after it happened and I still am not. Do I feel incredibly thirsty? Not presently; but when I use to consume junk food back in 2006 yes; I did and quite regularly. My forehead is very oilish; which indicates liver problems. My LDL cholesterol is very low which indicates liver problem. Did I do Liver Biopsy? No doctors ordered it; so; no. Did I loose or gained weight? My weight has always been around 154 pounds; I do not get any more fatter nor skinnier. Did I have fever? Maybe not; I might have felt a little warm but not in a concerning level so I didnt even check. Do I still suffer from bloody diarrhea? Not bloody anymore; but I still suffer from diarrhea when I eat certain foods such as rice or junk food. My Hairloss is so weird that whenever I clean my room I find hair from my legs; arms; and in massive amounts; they just come out. When I have to remove hair from my nose I dont even feel pain; it just comes out as if it was loosen up there. I been SUFFERING with these problems since 2005; came around to really know them in 2006. Perhaps that if it was only me who had those symptoms I would feel hypochondriac indeed; but my brother; my father and my cousin family (two females and one male) are experiecing the exact same symptoms. Now I am trying to find a fellow doctor who would be kind into analyzing my case and not just dismissing me as a hypochondriac or stressed. Thanks if you took the time to read this; I appreciate; I put some effort into writing it because I wanted to know if anybody could help me and not just dismiss me as a hypochondriac.,2009,2009,,,hello everyon i thought million way write problem easi eye ill begin status i live so paulo brazil fair tropic weather gender male age 22 weight 154 pound height 5 feet 7 drink no smoke no exercis yes regular 1st year medic student start uk go finish brazil sexual orient straight eat habit back 2005 junk food regular white rice meat eat habit back 2006 vegetarian consum fish eat habit back 2007 lesser junk food back eat meat white rice eat habit back 2008 present vegetarian i consum rice veget take ani medic yes 25mg atenolol daili began take 2006 hypochondriac no stress no brazil outbreak yellow fever malaria dengu common citi surround i symptom i current experienc respect year discoveri hypertens 2006 hair loss everywher bodi top head affect 2005 im almost bald top head gall stone 2006 moder gastriti 2006 hepat steatosi i drink alcohol 2006 bloat eat 2005 sometim i get diarrhea strong pain lower gi right belli button 2005 white rice junk food give cramp diarrhea present import exam i cholesterol 20mgdl ldl yes i know 20mgdl ldl even possibl 2007 hiv negat decemb 2008 this greatest fear im glad i rule hepat a negat decemb 2008 hepat b negat decemb 2008 hepat c negat decemb 2008 rubeola measl negat immun decemb 2008 toxoplasmosi igg 5810 iuml igm 00 iuml decemb 2008 ekg normal 2006 2007 2008 mri neck normal 2007 chest xray normal2006 ultrasound heart organ normal except abnorm find hepat steatosi 2006 cbc geez i so mani cbcs i lost track everi singl one came normal 2005 2006 2007 2008 colonoscopi small benign polyp found quick remov find 2006 vitamin level normal 2007 urin normal geez i also countless urin exam mani kind i dont even rememb anymor even pee day jar 2006 testosteron level total 7397 ngdl normal 2410 8270 ngdl lh 30 muiml acth hormon 163 pgml normal 00 460 pgml prolactin 75 ngml normal 21 177 ngml plasmat cortisol normal cardiac enzym normal thyroid exam tsh t4 etc etc normal thousand exam i alreadi forgot normal glucos normal level 2005060708 endoscopi moder gastriti 200607 for month back 2006 i suffer bloodi diarrhea blood quit red fresh indic lower gi bleed that reason i colonoscopi first place abnorm found besid small benign polyp remov analys determin benign i relax person i suffer form stress strangest part i share symptom father brother my cousin famili they start suffer gastrointestin disturb hypertens hair loss exact like and around time i start and i say gastro intestin disturb i mean sever i rush er stagger pain lower gi belli button i felt i get stab knife 0 10 id say 95 pain level pain go away doctor thought i apend time i mri neck reveal everyth normal i discharg without treatment besid buscopan becaus close relat suffer symptom i assum infecti cbc rule i go perform exam wednesday check whether i poison metal compound barium town case barium contamin place near water suppli been month i exercis regular didnt chang much besid slow heart rate but i still feel palpit veri annoy especi i eat someth i dont even need say i thousand doctor right and thousand exam tri find caus hypertens noth ive told i hypochondriac symptom relat stress quit frank i tire hear thing my stori simpli one day i normal next i shit blood loos hair hypertens i stress depress happen i still do i feel incred thirsti not present i use consum junk food back 2006 yes i quit regular my forehead oilish indic liver problem my ldl cholesterol low indic liver problem did i liver biopsi no doctor order did i loos gain weight my weight alway around 154 pound i get fatter skinnier did i fever mayb i might felt littl warm concern level i didnt even check do i still suffer bloodi diarrhea not bloodi anymor i still suffer diarrhea i eat certain food rice junk food my hairloss weird whenev i clean room i find hair leg arm massiv amount come when i remov hair nose i dont even feel pain come loosen i suffer problem sinc 2005 came around realli know 2006 perhap symptom i would feel hypochondriac inde brother father cousin famili two femal one male experiec exact symptom now i tri find fellow doctor would kind analyz case dismiss hypochondriac stress thank took time read i appreci i put effort write i want know anybodi could help dismiss hypochondriac
646,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 59 year old male. Past medical history of controlled hypertension and cervical fusion C5-7 in 2004 for spinal stenosis. I was doing fine until about 7 months ago. My house was being painted and the painters used a very strong smelling lacquer on the woodwork. I have no idea if this has anything to do with the problem; but it coincided with the onset of my symptoms. I developed vertigo. I was first diagnosed with BPPV and sent for Epley maneuvers. When these didn't help; I underwent a video nystagmogram which was read as normal. The symptoms persisted along with intermittent headaches. General lab work including workup for autoimmune disease was negative as were MRIs of the brain and neck and carotid dopplers. A neurosurgeon recommended a epidural steroid injection which relieved the headaches as well as some visual problems I was having; but had no effect on the vertigo. Actually; the vertigo morphed into more of a feeling of dizziness with my head swimming. There was no nausea or vomiting. Another ENT suggested vestibular migraine; but the addition of nortriptyline did nothing. Lying flat my symptoms are almost gone. Sitting up my head spins but I can tolerate the symptoms. However; standing and walking are intolerable. I was off work for a few months but after some vestibular rehab; I have returned with limited success. I've also tried acupuncture and gentle cervical manipulation without success. I fear I will have to retire. No days are good; but some are worse than others. Somedays I have headaches; others I do not. My meds are unchanged and include Losartan; atenolol; HCTZ; and Simvastatin.

647,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 31 year old male and I was recently prescribed Adderall IR 10mg for ADD. The Psychiatrist told me to take two pills a day; as each pill gets out of your system within/around 4 hours. I noticed upon taking the first pill on the first day around 9am; I didn't feel it wearing off until the early evening; so I wasn't about to take another. Although the ""wearing off"" made me feel exhausted and the same feeling on the second day. Today is the third day and I took the pill around 8:30 this morning and felt the effects dwindling about an hour ago. I'm just curious--I'm assuming there is some sort of period where your body has to get used to the Adderall? Not like building up a tolerance to it necessarily; but your body simply adjusting to the new medication? It's weird too because I do have a bit of anxiety without the Adderall; but with the Adderall there is still some nervous energy there; but it feels more focused. Like the anxiety is attempting to rear its ugly head but I'm able to keep it at bay a little better. Maybe that's just a coincidence. Also; I was concerned that my BP jumped up a few points when I started taking it and I hope that will normalize a bit as well. I take Atenolol 50mg for hypertension; and it hangs around 125-130 over 80 most days. With the Adderall; I can see the systolic number getting just under 140 with the diastolic number sometimes hitting 85-90. I know I'm already borderline with my BP but if it goes back to normal after a few weeks; I'm not too concerned.",2009,2013,31.0,Male,im 31 year old male i recent prescrib adderal ir 10mg add the psychiatrist told take two pill day pill get system withinaround 4 hour i notic upon take first pill first day around 9am i didnt feel wear earli even i wasnt take anoth although wear made feel exhaust feel second day today third day i took pill around 830 morn felt effect dwindl hour ago im curiousim assum sort period bodi get use adderal not like build toler necessarili bodi simpli adjust new medic it weird i bit anxieti without adderal adderal still nervous energi feel focus like anxieti attempt rear ugli head im abl keep bay littl better mayb that coincid also i concern bp jump point i start take i hope normal bit well i take atenolol 50mg hypertens hang around 125130 80 day with adderal i see systol number get 140 diastol number sometim hit 8590 i know im alreadi borderlin bp goe back normal week im concern

649,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 31 yr old female with a long history of arrhythmia problems. I wear a pacemaker after repeated EP studies and ablation failed to correct my problem with atrial tachycardias. I am writing because I believe I have received more bad news. I very recently had an echo which showed that I had some enlargement of my right atria and ventricle; along with moderate tricuspid insuffiency. I also have been determined to have mild pulmonary hypertension. All of these findings are new; I have never had them before until now. The report says my RV systolic pressure is 33mm above my RA pressure. I have been trying to understand what these numbers mean. However; overall; I have not heard good things about pulmonary hypertension. I also because of my condition am 100% dependent on my pacemaker for my life and I am concerned that the leads could be contributing to the problem. I actually have 3 leads--one atrial and two ventricular--one is a lead from a past pacer that caused me serious problems. The lead was not compatible with my upgraded machine which has two wires. Now I have this third wire in there just hanging around. I am also despondent about why my physician's office never told me about these results. (This is not the first time; however; delays for abnormal results have been stashed away in a chart unbenounced to the patient). Because I didn't get notified; I am really not sure what to think. Is this important? It doesn't seem that way to my doctor's office. Thanks for any feedback you can give me here.,2002,2002,,,hello i 31 yr old femal long histori arrhythmia problem i wear pacemak repeat ep studi ablat fail correct problem atrial tachycardia i write i believ i receiv bad news i recent echo show i enlarg right atria ventricl along moder tricuspid insuffi i also determin mild pulmonari hypertens all find new i never the report say rv systol pressur 33mm ra pressur i tri understand number mean howev overal i heard good thing pulmonari hypertens i also condit 100 depend pacemak life i concern lead could contribut problem i actual 3 leadson atrial two ventricularon lead past pacer caus serious problem the lead compat upgrad machin two wire now i third wire hang around i also despond physician offic never told result this first time howev delay abnorm result stash away chart unbenounc patient becaus i didnt get notifi i realli sure think is import it doesnt seem way doctor offic thank feedback give
650,Atenolol+hypertension,I was placed on Atenolol 50mg once a day by my doctor when my BP was 140/90. I used it for about one month but went back to the doctor when it gave me terrible headaches and back ache. So I was told to switch to Aldactone 25mg. After 2 weeks of using the Aldactone; my BP got back to 120/80 for the next one month after taking the Aldactone. Meanwhile; my eye doctor gave me Diamox and Slow-K for one week in the last of my taking Aldactone.My doctor asked me to stop the drug 6 days ago since my BP is back to normal. However; I have been experiencing numbness in the right side of my body (from head to toe!) and especially at night and/or when I lie down or am asleep. I wake up in the night to ease myself and am notice the numbness and fear grips me. For 2 nights; I have trembled uncontrollably on that same right side of my body At times I feel breathless and my chest feels tight. Most worrisome is the fuzzy feeling in the right side of my head that I try to ignore all day. Please; what's happening? Are these side effects of stopping the Aldactone? Am a 41 -year old woman.

651,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?) For some reason; I just can shake this fear. thanks",2008,2008,,,hello dr i 33 year old male hypertens bicuspid aorta for year i great deal health anxieti manifest fast heart rate occasion palpit mayb arrythmia etc doctor believ anxieti play role hypertens i take 25mg atenolol 20mg lisinopril daili bp read avg 13085 my problem im alway scare sudden death im athlet i work 45 time week whenev i read athlet sudden die heart relat problem im sure also happen ive worn holter monitor get regular echo due bicuspid diagnosi stress echo event monitor theyv never realli found anyth stenosi cardiomyopathi etc so i feel pretti comfort structur heart fine wont caus problem i still worri electr problem would seen thing like brugada syndrom long qt syndrom recogn problem vagal tone etc should i ask see ep cardiologist well basic current symptom occasion flutter especi right i fall asleep occasion rapid heart rate feel weaker normal accompani sensat base neck carotid arteri vagus nerv for reason i shake fear thank

654,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello I'm 28 years old; male. I had a bout of atrial fib once a few months ago. I had it for maybe two or three hours. I think it was stress that caused it. It had been building up for a while. My ER doc. said he wasn't going to give me meds because I was young and would probably never have the problem again. I had an echocardiogram later in that month and everything was normal according to the report. Atria were normal size. Blood ejection volume was normal etc. I also had a heart event monitor which showed no atrial fib for the month after my episode. My GP doctor (not a heart specialist) said that he was happy with the results and decided not to do anything. I'm on 81mg of aspirin and also atenolol for high blood pressure. My cholestrol test are very good; and I have no diabetes. I am still very worried about stroke though. I have seen a lot of horror stories online about younger people having strokes. What is my risk for stroke? I don't think I've been in atrial fib since that one time. I'm also wondering how doctors decide what meds for clots to put you on? Is it age? and underlying heart disease? High Cholestrol? When is warfarin used and when is just aspirin used? Is 81 mg of aspirin enough for someone in my situation? Also if I have had atrial fib once in the past is it a good idea to get checked for it again? How often? These questions have been lingering in my head and I have had a lot of anxiety over them. Any answers would be great! Thanks for your help! ~Matt,2007,2007,,,hello im 28 year old male i bout atrial fib month ago i mayb two three hour i think stress caus it build my er doc said wasnt go give med i young would probabl never problem i echocardiogram later month everyth normal accord report atria normal size blood eject volum normal etc i also heart event monitor show atrial fib month episod my gp doctor heart specialist said happi result decid anyth im 81mg aspirin also atenolol high blood pressur my cholestrol test good i diabet i still worri stroke though i seen lot horror stori onlin younger peopl stroke what risk stroke i dont think ive atrial fib sinc one time im also wonder doctor decid med clot put is age under heart diseas high cholestrol when warfarin use aspirin use is 81 mg aspirin enough someon situat also i atrial fib past good idea get check how often these question linger head i lot anxieti ani answer would great thank help matt
655,Atenolol+hypertension,My daughter was put on a beta blocker one month ago for test anxiety to be taken as needed. She is in college; 19 yrs old. We have noticed her behavior has changed from fairly nice to obnoxious this past month. It could be boyfriend issue (he is done with college and leaving for home). I started wondering if this could be a side effect from the medication. I am not familiar with beta blockers; have done searches but I want to ask medhelp is anyone else has experienced a side effect similar to this. ~El,2008,2009,47.0,Female,my daughter put beta blocker one month ago test anxieti taken need she colleg 19 yrs old we notic behavior chang fair nice obnoxi past month it could boyfriend issu done colleg leav home i start wonder could side effect medic i familiar beta blocker done search i want ask medhelp anyon els experienc side effect similar el

657,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth Anderson on February 26; 1998 at 01:45:04: I am a 47 year old female who is severely obese. I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart?

658,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had hypertension for several years and have trouble with side effects from meds. I have been taking Clonidine and Atenolol. Since taking the clonidine since March I have felt strange sensations in my chest and also gained 10 pounds in two weeks. I have been back to the Internal Medicine physician several times because of this. Last week as I was walking in the park up a steep hill; I became short of breath and dizzy. I had a hard time breathing. I went to the do again and he gave me Valturna in additon to the other drugs. The breathing problem continued where I could not catch my breath. On Sunday I felt this weird sensation in my body and again could not breath. The electrocardiogram showed extra beats and it was recommeded that I get a holter monitor. The results were pvc s and pac s. Knowing that I have a hard time with meds; he said just to continue the meds. Valturna 150 mg; clonidine 0.1 mg twice a day and Atenolol 25 mg twice daily. I feel like a zombie in the corner. Is it necessary to take this much medication. Also my bp was hard to control on the clonidine and Atenolol. This discussion is related to Are PVC's � PAC's Really benign or can they lead to future problems?.,2010,2010,64.0,Female,i hypertens sever year troubl side effect med i take clonidin atenolol sinc take clonidin sinc march i felt strang sensat chest also gain 10 pound two week i back intern medicin physician sever time last week i walk park steep hill i becam short breath dizzi i hard time breath i went gave valturna additon drug the breath problem continu i could catch breath on sunday i felt weird sensat bodi could breath the electrocardiogram show extra beat recommed i get holter monitor the result pvc pac know i hard time med said continu med valturna 150 mg clonidin 01 mg twice day atenolol 25 mg twice daili i feel like zombi corner is necessari take much medic also bp hard control clonidin atenolol this discuss relat are pvcs pac realli benign lead futur problem
659,Atenolol+hypertension,I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post.

661,Atenolol+hypertension,I have fainted with almost no warning on 4 occasions over the last few months. In each case I have quickly regained consciousness without any lasting effects. On two occasions this occurred in public shortly after a meal; which scared my fellow diners. On the other two occasions it was at home; once in the bathroom; and the other while working at my computer. The pattern seems to be first a feeling of dizziness; I am sweating profusely and feeling generally unsteady. The onset in rapid and I black out completely within the next one to two minutes. On one occasion I was aware of tunnel vision a few seconds before fainting. I am told that I regain consciousness quite fast once I am on the floor; in any event enough to head off those around me from calling an ambulance. Although I can't know this from my own experience; I guess that we must be talking around 30 seconds of unconsciousness. When I come to at first I have no knowledge of where I am or how I got there. I am feeling quite contented with no pain. Full feeling and awareness quickly return; probably within one to two minutes; although I never actually remember the point of passing out. Once I have recovered I feel perfectly fine; no pain; no shortage of breath; normal heartbeat etc. The only symptom is a slight headache. On one occasion I took my blood pressure shortly afterwards. The reading was slightly low at 110/65. I take Atenolol for hypertension (v. effective). I am 47; male. I am concerned lest this is symptomatic of some kind of intermittent heart problem.,2002,2002,,,i faint almost warn 4 occas last month in case i quick regain conscious without last effect on two occas occur public short meal scare fellow diner on two occas home bathroom work comput the pattern seem first feel dizzi i sweat profus feel general unsteadi the onset rapid i black complet within next one two minut on one occas i awar tunnel vision second faint i told i regain conscious quit fast i floor event enough head around call ambul although i cant know experi i guess must talk around 30 second unconsci when i come first i knowledg i i got i feel quit content pain full feel awar quick return probabl within one two minut although i never actual rememb point pass onc i recov i feel perfect fine pain shortag breath normal heartbeat etc the symptom slight headach on one occas i took blood pressur short afterward the read slight low 11065 i take atenolol hypertens v effect i 47 male i concern lest symptomat kind intermitt heart problem
662,Atenolol+hypertension,Going to Doc: please comment The left atrium was approaching the upper limits of normal size at 3.90 cm. The left ventricle is normal in size at 3.95 cm; with a systolic dimension of 3.90 cm. The left ventricle demonstrates moderate hypertrophy. The left ventricular wall; including the septum; altered its size and shape normally and moved appropriately in systole and diastole. There was no evidence of segmental wall motion abnormality. The estimated ejection fraction is 85%. The mitral valve shows mild annular calcification. The valvular leaflets appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or prolapse. Doppler studies of the mitral valve reveal evidence of trace mitral insufficiency; and the prominent A wave noted on Doppler inflow suggests decreased left ventriclular compliance. The right atrium and right ventricle; including inflow and outflow tracts; appeared normal. The aortic valve shows annular calcification with mile calcification of the aortic valve cusps. The valvular cusps appear pliable and move appropriately without evidence of stenosis or insufficiency. There is a measured transvalvular gradient of 6.11 mm of mercury across the valve; which is clinically insignificant for stenosis. The tricuspid and pulmonic valves were normal with evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency and mild pulmonic insufficiency on Doppler study. There were no vegetations seen on any valve. No intracavity masses or thrombi were noted. There was no evidence of pericardial infusion. Conclusion: Left atrial size approached the upper limits of normal. Normmal left ventricular chanber size with moderate concentric hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 85%. Mitral sclerosis with trace mitral insufficiency and a Doppler inflow pattern suggestive of decreased left ventricular compliance. Aortic sclerosis with no evidence of significant valvular dysfunction. Mild tricuspid insuffiency.

665,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my ?? I had an echo done nearly 5 years ago ; it showed only borderline hypertrophy; I had a echo done this past Tuesday which the cardio said had progressed from borderline to mild; a change of about 2mm if I remember correctly; B/P was 140/85 in the doc's office; at home every time I take it is always control around 115/70 most of the time. He said that from the blood vessel in my eyes ; it showed that my B/P needed more aggressive treatment; He up my cozaar from 50mg daily to 50mg x2 daily and added hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; I also take 100mg of atenolol daily in divided doses; he said that is a good way to take atenolol because it is not as long acting as thought. I have a connective tissue disease that can affect the heart valves thats mainly why i had the echo; he said my valves are perfect ; no leaks ; no obstruction whatsoever and that my heart relaxes perfect despite the mild LVH; in fact this time he seemed less concerned than he did 5 years ago; in fact 5 years ago to be honest he almost alarmed me about the borderline hypertrophy; now he seems to think that with weight lost ; 25-30 lbs overweight and more aggressive B/P control; I have nothing to worry about. My ejection fraction was 55% at lowest estimation; last time it was 64- 75%; though I was much more nervous at that time. I was kinda of concerned about the drop; he said that was perfect and not to worry. At what measurements are LVH a clear concern? If my B/P is controlled at home why is the LVH progressing if even by 2mm in 5 years? I don't want to overmedicate.

666,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have ALWAYS had a rather low blood pressure; anywhere from 90/50 to 110/65; they used to not let me donate blood because the b/p would be too low. Of course; I was younger then. Now I am a 41 yr old woman. My family history includes everybody with high blood pressure. Lately I've not been feeling too well; I've had lots of periods of tachycardia and shortness of breath and PVCs as many as every other beat; but echo showed a normal heart so I am not to worry. However because of the continued chest pain with exercise that resolves with rest; a family history of heart disease; a new murmur heard at the exam; and continued mild tachycardia at rest; they decided to do a Cardiolite stress test and do a new echo....fully believing it to be nothing but just to be safe. The thing I don't understand is lately I've had periods of wide blood pressure elevation. Please note I have never had ""white coat hypertension"" before. Nonetheless my b/p has been 185/120; 175/110; 170/90 on at least three occasions in doctors offices. I have recorded it on several occasions at grocery stores in the neighborhood of 145-155 / 85-95 using the automatic blood pressure machines. By the same token; just as often it is 126-139 / 76-90. Is there any significance to this variability? The doctors have generally not commented on the pressure taken in their offices when it was so high except that once asked if I was nervous. Usually the nurse will say your blood pressure seems to be high today and then the doctor comes and looks at the chart and says nothing. For now I am assuming that since a good portion of the time it appears the blood pressure is within normal range; that means it is ok?

667,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 27 yo fem. with 2 kids. I'm fairly healthy; a mild asthmatic and problems with gaining/maintaining weight. After my son was born in '00; I began experiencing momentary dizziness. I had a holter monitor for 48 hrs; nothing weird showed up. I had my first syncope episode this summer; at a dance class. I had fallen and sprained my ankle; and 10 min later; I passed out. The squad was called and my pulse was irregular and my EKGs were abnormal. I went to the dr. the next day; they did another ekg; I showed sinus bradycardia. Normally not an issue but I had passed out. Plus; I'm not in great shape. I take 1 hr of dance a week (aerobic exercise) and that's all; and for both my pregnancies I was confined to bed for preterm labor for 4 and 7 months respectively. They did a tilt table test; It was neg; but as the meds wore off I did note that I skipped/paused my heartrate a lot. Since that first syncope episode I've had 4-5 episodes of near syncope. I've not had a fully normal ekg since then either. It either shows sinus tachy; sinus brady or sinus arrhythmia. All of these combined have me puzzled. I've been tested for so much because of my weight issues; and the first dr.

668,Atenolol+hypertension,My daughter had her gall bladder removed last Friday and left the hospital the next day. Yesterday. Thursday; she was rushed to the ER after being dizzy for days and BP of 172/105; heart rate 82. Blood and urine tests were ok; chest xrays and ekg were ok. She was released; without medication; with the direction to see the surgeon that did the gall bladder removal. Today her BP is 135/105 with heart rate of 80-85 ------- She feels the surgery is the problem. I feel a cardiologist is the only one that will help. She will be calling her surgeon as the ER advised.

671,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been getting runs of bigeminys lasting up to an hour all day long. They will start with a hard skip and continue. I do get a break in between; but lasting no more than half an hour. This has been going on for a month. My cardiologist wants to put me on tambacor; .50mg twice a day. I'm a little afraid to go on that pill. What is your opinion of tambacor? I take atenolol now; .50mg a day ( cut in half twice a day.) Also I take avapro 150mg daily. Also I take synthroid .112mg. Atenolol does nothing for me but slow my heart down. I have been plagued with heart skips for 20 years. Been through every test possible; and tried everything possible. Nothing works. I know I can't continue this way. It is leaving me paralyzed with fear. Any suggestions? Do you think I could wean myself off of the atenolol? I have been taking it for many years. Ablation is out; too many horror stories about that. Do you think the slow heart beat (56 to 62) could be a culprit? I just want my life back; I'm so depressed. Thanks for listening.

672,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all? With the new guidlines for blood pessure being what they are;am I still at risk for long term problems;even though I'm taking all the above meds;if my blood pressure continues to stay were it's at?

674,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 30 year old female. Since June of this year; I have been experiencing a rapid heart beat. The first time it hapeened I was in bed sleeping!! but it usually occurrs after eating. My heart rate goes anywhere between 100 - 130 bpm and stays there sometimes for a couple hours. I've had an echo done; which was normal (right ventricle was not well visualized; however); ekgs; blood work and an event monitor that I wore for 21 days. My doctor says its not a rythym problem. Possibly anxiety. I take xanax .5 milligrams 2x a day. I have a prescription for a beta blocker; but i havent filled it yet. I dont like taking meds much. I have a family history of heart attacks (maternal grandmother) and my mother has a history of MVP (although she recently got an echo done which did not show MVP and her cardiologist said that the criteria for MVP has changed) so now she's not sure whether she has it; but for years she was told she did. Anyway; my questions are: 1) What is the difference between sinus tach and SVT? would they show up differently on an EKG? 2) How fast is too fast for a heart rate? 3) although my echo was normal; my doctor hears a click when he listens to my heart. if echo was normal; what could the click be from?? 4) kind of off fast heartrates; but I also have a pounding in my chest when standing to quickly or stretching; not like a fast beat; more like a slow; hard beat that lasts for a couple seconds. Is this normal? sorry this post is so long. I'm kind of obsessing over my heart these days. thanks.,2003,2003,,,hi im 30 year old femal sinc june year i experienc rapid heart beat the first time hapeen i bed sleep usual occurr eat my heart rate goe anywher 100 130 bpm stay sometim coupl hour ive echo done normal right ventricl well visual howev ekg blood work event monitor i wore 21 day my doctor say rythym problem possibl anxieti i take xanax 5 milligram 2x day i prescript beta blocker havent fill yet i dont like take med much i famili histori heart attack matern grandmoth mother histori mvp although recent got echo done show mvp cardiologist said criteria mvp chang shes sure whether year told anyway question 1 what differ sinus tach svt would show differ ekg 2 how fast fast heart rate 3 although echo normal doctor hear click listen heart echo normal could click 4 kind fast heartrat i also pound chest stand quick stretch like fast beat like slow hard beat last coupl second is normal sorri post long im kind obsess heart day thank

681,Atenolol+hypertension,In 1994; at the age of 15; I began having what was thought to be panic attacks by me and my parents. These episodes would generally last an hour; and would include palpitations and shortness of breath. In January 1997; after having several episodes lasting greater than 3 hours each; I was diagnosed with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome; and then mitral valve prolapse once an echo was performed. I was seen by a pediatric Electrophysiologist (Dr. Sterba) at the Cleveland Clinic. An RF Ablation was performed in May of that year. Everything was great for about a year; at which time I started experiencing sinus tachycardia with hypertension. Resting HR of 120-140; resting BP of 180/120. I went back to Cleveland; was put on beta blockers with the hopes of weaning me off of them and doing futher testing to determine why I was tachy. My EKG looked normal; with no delta wave present. I could not tolerate being weaned off of the beta blocker; and was left on it; at the same dose (50mg Atenolol) for about 2 years. This dose stopped holding me for 24 hours; and so I increased myself to 75mg/day (50mg qam; 25mg qpm). I did this only until I could get in to see my family physician. He changed me to 100mg Toprol XL qday. This only worked for about 12 hours however; then I was once again experiencing tachycardia. My dose was increased to 100mg bid. This seemed to keep my heart rate down; but my htn persisted at a low level (140/110). I was placed on Cozaar; 50mg qday; about a year later for the htn; but it persisted; at about the same level. Once I started seeing a cardiologist again; I was placed on 100mg Cozaar. A year later; after a follow up visit to my cardiologist; I was then placed on 100/12.5mg Hyzaar qday. I was instructed that my BP was to stay below 120/80. This final med has accomplished that. I have been in the 100/60 range for some time now; which has taken a while to get used to. I guess I was just wondering if there is anyone out there who has had a similar experience; and if they every had a definitive diagnosis? I've never been told exactly why my heart does what it does or why my BP is what it is. Any information would be greatly appreciated. I've diagnosed myself with inappropriate sinus tachycardia....but; I don't know.,2007,2007,,,in 1994 age 15 i began thought panic attack parent these episod would general last hour would includ palpit short breath in januari 1997 sever episod last greater 3 hour i diagnos wolff parkinson white syndrom mitral valv prolaps echo perform i seen pediatr electrophysiologist dr sterba cleveland clinic an rf ablat perform may year everyth great year time i start experienc sinus tachycardia hypertens rest hr 120140 rest bp 180120 i went back cleveland put beta blocker hope wean futher test determin i tachi my ekg look normal delta wave present i could toler wean beta blocker left dose 50mg atenolol 2 year this dose stop hold 24 hour i increas 75mgday 50mg qam 25mg qpm i i could get see famili physician he chang 100mg toprol xl qday this work 12 hour howev i experienc tachycardia my dose increas 100mg bid this seem keep heart rate htn persist low level 140110 i place cozaar 50mg qday year later htn persist level onc i start see cardiologist i place 100mg cozaar a year later follow visit cardiologist i place 100125mg hyzaar qday i instruct bp stay 12080 this final med accomplish i 10060 rang time taken get use i guess i wonder anyon similar experi everi definit diagnosi ive never told exact heart bp ani inform would great appreci ive diagnos inappropri sinus tachycardiabut i dont know
682,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 33 years old Male and a working executive in MNC. Right side upper lip numbness happened about 2 years ago gradually going upwards to cover the right cheek and nose part. Headeache also happened during the numbness. The period of numbness was half an hour and repeated about 4 times in 2 months. The timing of the occurence is same everytime that is after morning bath with hot water and at the rise of winters. I underwent the brain MRI; MRA; Heart related tests like LIPID profile; ECHO; etc. and everything was normal except a sign of sinusitis on right side. The numbness is repeated after 2 years now and it lasted for about 2-3 hours now; covering same area and happened at same time. The numbness covered right side upper lip; tooth jaw; right cheek and right side of the nose. Now again the brain MRI is normal. My neurologist said it is a general anxiety disorder. It is not TIA as MRI is normal even after 2 years. I want to check with you on that. Also want to check if migraine can cause one sided face numbness along with headache and what is the cure. By nature; I become anxious at times; worrying about petty things; etc. I am still wondering what is causing the numbness and that too lasting for more than 2 hours now. Is it a migraine? or GAD? or Sinusitus? OR something else? I also have a Hypertension history for about 5 years and currently on Atenolol 50 mg. My BP is mostly under control with the medication.

683,Atenolol+hypertension,I have high blood pressure. One year ago I was put on Accupril. Three months later I was switched to Lisinopril due to an insurance change. In May of '99 while driving to work; my heart began beating very hard. I could hear it beating in my head and it felt as if it could beat out of my chest. It was followed by two brief black-outs. Fortunately I made it to the side of the road without hurting anyone. I felt nauseated and had a very dry mouth. At the ER they gave me an EKG and a brain scan. When they determined nothing was seriously wrong with me they let me go. My doctor had me quit taking high blood pressure medication for awhile and see how I did. I was off of them for about 6 months when I started getting blood pressure headaches again. He then put me on 25 mg of Atenolol. I found immediate relief in headaches and my blood pressure went down. Two days ago while sitting at my desk at work; the heart started its hard beating again and I felt as if I could black out; but I did not. I stood up and walked for a minute and it went away. Neither episode occured during a stressful situation. Two doctors have told me that nothing can be done and that we can't know what it is unless we catch it while its happening. My fear is that I could black out again while driving and hurt not only myself but someone else. Has anyone heard anything like this? If so; what could be the problem? My doctor said the irregular rythms are normal; but he really didn't have an answer for the blacking out. I thought maybe my blood pressure was going to low; but he said no. I would appreciate any advice I could get.

684,Atenolol+hypertension,"I apologize for this loaded question. I'm 31 year old female;complex arrhythmia hist primarily atrial tachys SVT;WPW?; including atrial fib. I've had 4 EP studies; 3 with ablation. Tachys persist. AV node ablated; given unipolar pacemaker with single lead; later upgraded to bipolar with two leads; but original lead was left in. Have 3 wires. Echo last year was determined abnormal due to mild pulmonary hypertension with right vent and right atrial enlargement. Had moderate tricuspid regurg. Cardiologist here suggested I see a pulm hyperten specialist; but also suggested my pacemaker system could be contributing to my problem. I have become progressively worse with shortness of breath. With exertion I get jaw pain; nausea and dizziness. Cardiologist here says he isn't sure what to do. I recently went to another ""Best Hospital"" for evaluation and opinion (not yours). Had myoview stress test; showed some decrease in bloodflow in an area of my heart that resolved with rest. I went through cardiac cath. Early into procedure I had vent fibrillation. They said my arteries looked fine; but I had dyskinesia of my right vent. They planned to test for coronary art spasm; but abandoned it. They mentioned med Coreg; but abandoned it. Though they wanted to help me at first; after the cath they dumped me as patient with no further care. No pacer check for over 6 hours since defib; unmonitored.

685,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the ISV 14mm; all other measurements are within the normal limits; EF 55%; overall my other heart measurements though within the normal limits are on the smaller side; I've been told I have a very powerful heart. I'm 5'9"" approximately 195 lbs. about 30 lbs overweight accordong to BMI even though my cardio tells me I'm really only about 15lbs overweight because of my built. I used to suffer PVCs and hypertension; but rarely have PVCs anymore; I'm on atenolol 100mg; cozaar 25mg BID; and HCTC 12.5mg. B/P well controlled 105/60 to 90/55 are usually my reading these days. I read on another post recently that a 13mm wall measurement of the heart would not be considered LVH in a very large person; I thought that even 13-15mm in well conditioned athletes sometimes raised concern; most doctors have told me LVH is not a good thing even when mild.My latest ECG 1 month ago did not suggest LVH like the old ones; I know its not the gold standard in diagnosing LVH; but Do you think it is possible it could have regressed through aggressive treatment? When speaking of PVCs in the setting of a structurally normal being benign and not leading to SCD; would mild LVH like mine with everything thing else within the normal limits fall into the same category as being benign and not making one more prone to dangerous arrhythmias and SCD? I've learned to deal with the anxieties my PVCs have caused me and still learning coping methods to deal with them even better ; they dont scare me anymore like before; but with mild LVH; I still wonder and these ?s Tks",2005,2006,41.0,Male,ive diagnos mild lvh isv 14mm measur within normal limit ef 55 overal heart measur though within normal limit smaller side ive told i power heart im 59 approxim 195 lbs 30 lbs overweight accordong bmi even though cardio tell im realli 15lbs overweight built i use suffer pvcs hypertens rare pvcs anymor im atenolol 100mg cozaar 25mg bid hctc 125mg bp well control 10560 9055 usual read day i read anoth post recent 13mm wall measur heart would consid lvh larg person i thought even 1315mm well condit athlet sometim rais concern doctor told lvh good thing even mildmi latest ecg 1 month ago suggest lvh like old one i know gold standard diagnos lvh do think possibl could regress aggress treatment when speak pvcs set structur normal benign lead scd would mild lvh like mine everyth thing els within normal limit fall categori benign make one prone danger arrhythmia scd ive learn deal anxieti pvcs caus still learn cope method deal even better dont scare anymor like mild lvh i still wonder tks
686,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the IVS; all other dimensions within normal limits last echo in mid 2005 showed an IVS of 14mm EF 55% no leakages of the valves; the cardiologist describes the jets as perfect whatever that means; I was in rush to catch a flight back and forgot to ask; though he assured me that I don't have HCM. I was mild hypertensive for years but is controlled with atenolol 100mg daily cozaar 25mg twice daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily; BP been averaging around 105/65 for couple of years now. In 2001 echo showed borderline LVH with dimensions ofthe IVS 10mm to12mm; with an of EF 65-70%; same cardio ; same echo machine. I was supposed to get an echo this year but due to unforseen events had to skip; Do you think with the info provided its is reasonable to wait another year? I'm 43 years old male and been a sufferer of tachycardia & PVcs all my life but all test was negative including echo; stress test and holter ; I rarely have PVCs anymore and no tachycardia at all; Does the diagnosis of Mild LVH put me at any significant increased risk for Sudden cardiac events? I also have ankylosing spondylitis; do you think that could be a contributing factor for LVH?; I know it can affect the aortic valve and conduction systems in a small % of persons with Ankylosing spondylitis.

689,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am 31 year old male and my series of problem started in May'07 on one of the evenings when I felt something like a signal passed to my head from stomach and felt dizzy. I became panic and went to see my family doctor (I have been on medication for primary hypertension for last 4 years). Blood tests; ECG etc has been conducted and nothing found wrong. He told me not to worry but I had started getting dizziness once in a while and I became very anxious about it. I also had a mild frontal headache and muscle weakness. Then I realized that I started getting panic when I face public in functions; taking flight journeys; worrying that I might faint. I went to see a neurologist in July'07 and after the physical excercise test; he told me nothing to worry; however I had insisted for an MRI. The MRI with contrast done in July07 (of brain with multiplanar T1w; T2w; FLAIR; GRE; DWI and post-gadolinium sequences) was perfect and no abnormalities found except presence of paranasal sinusitis (I have seen an ENT and polyps has been found in the frontal sinus. Subsequent CT scan showed my frontal sinus are filled with white matter and I am supposed to go for an operation to remove polyps). I was happy with the MRI results; however the dizziness episode and the frontal headache started disturbing me again in Sep'07 and my family doctor gave me antibiotics to clear the infection in sinuses. After three weeks of antibiotics course; the frontal headache was better; however I felt the dizziness; unbalanceness and weakness (especially on right side of the body) once in a while and I went to see the neurologist again in Dec'07 explaining my difficulties (Dizziness; numbness; unbalance; mild frontal headahe (especially above eyes); muscle weakness on left hand and leg; seeing floaters; anxiety; etc.). After conducting the physical tests; he told me nothing to worry and given me a tablet ""Lyrica 75 mg daily"". I have started taking it for last two weeks and there is a slight improvement in the numbness of my left leg and hand. When I asked my neuro on whether there is a need for MRI again; he told me re-scanning is not required at all and the recent MRI conducted in July'07 was perfect. My neuro is one of the leading specialists in my city. I am confused and I would like to request for a second opinion from the panel of doctors.

690,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 30yr/m and have had high blood pressure for the past 4-5 years. I currently take 25mg Atenolol once daily. My blood pressure is normally around 130/85 or so. Over the past 4 days I have been experiencing; what I believe are; panic attacks. I had some bad anxiety issues a few years ago; and the symptoms are very similar. During these attacks my blood pressure sky rockets. I check it yesterday after having one of these attacks and the reading was 165/110. Im quite sure it was much higher when I was actually having the symptoms since I was feeling much better at the time I took the reading. I think part of the fuel for the continued anxiety is the fear that I am going to have a stroke due to the sudden increase in blood pressure during the anxiety attacks. I have an appointment scheduled with my Dr. for this afternoon. My question is this: Is my fear that I could have a stroke due to my blood pressure getting so high during one these episodes legitimate or am I just worrying myself more? I have read different information that this sudden increase in blood pressure could cause a stroke; and then other which say that is not true; and that it takes many years of high blood pressure to cause a stroke to occur. I suppose i am afraid that my blood pressure will get too high during one of these episodes and a stroke will occur.

691,Atenolol+hypertension,"I went yesterday for cataract surgery; this was canceled. My heat rate was 36 to 50 bpm; with pvc's about every 3rd beat. I have had a very low heart rate for at least 10 years; (39 to 44 bpm; resting) and a ""heart murmer"" since 12 years old; I'm now 74. I take Enalapril (5 mG); Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mG); and Lovastatin (30mG). My regular Dr wanted a second opinion before he would OK the cataract surgery. I went to a cardiac specialist who gave me an ""echo cardiograph"" and a stress test; on meeting with him a week later he classified me as ""a low risk for the surgery"". No mention was made of the pvc's at all; and he did take an EKG. When I took the stress test my heart rate went from 42 (resting) to 124bpm; and all was pronounced OK. I did not experience any feeling for the pvc's at all. What should I do to correct this problem? What medications are suggested?

692,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi I was recently diagnosed with moderate to severe L3-L4 and L4-L5 stenosis. The MRI report also indicated moderate foraminal narrowing at 3 or 4 disc levels; and the report mentioned desiccation at all but one of the disc levels. The L4-L5 also indicated ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet athrosis. What does this mean? 34 years - 6 foot 4 inches; 230 lbs. I have episodic numbness and pain in legs; but also have this problem in arms and hands too (numbness and slight tremor). I also have abdominal pains (mostly ULQ) and fluctuation in stool. I don't smoke or drink. I'm on paxil (mood); lisinopril and small dose of atenolol (hypertension). I have taken paxil and lisinopril for years. I had two ablations for SVT in 2006 - second one caused a PE which I took warfarin for 6 months. No clotting factors. The numbness started in my legs and affects my hands and forearms as well. Sometimes I feel this squeezing feeling either in my hands or in my lower back. When I sit for long periods and then stand up and walk I sometimes get episodes of numbness and weakness that make me have to walk slow and/or sit down and rest. Also I get some strange sensations in my hands and forearms...like holding a phone my hand gets tense and heavy and I have to switch hands. Also; both arms fall ""asleep"" at night; and I am not laying on them. I have a stiff/aching neck for over a year that waxes and wanes; but stays sore all the time. I have had several workups before the MRI. I have normal cbc; liver blood tests; mri of head; abdominal ct; no lyme; b12; no hepatitis; no cmv; blood smear neg pathogens; etc. Normal ncv/emg Could the arm involvement indicate some cervical stenosis? Can lumbar stenosis to affect the arms? Also; the digestive issues - testing (colonoscopy; endoscopy; etc) is normal. Could this stenosis cause this?

Diagnosed w/ HTN '92. 5/’09; hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; diagnosed w/ A fib. 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. Initially paralyzed left side & recovered almost 90%. On our request; switched to Aspirin. 12/’09; open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis w/ pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days.

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

She sent me for an ECG which showed my pulse to be normal. They than sent me for a stress test and once again my pulse was high; but everything else was fine. The put me on beta blockers at this point to slow the rate of my heart and set up an echo. The echo showed my EF to be 35%. They have no idea what is causing my EF to be so low. I am a 26 year old female; fairly active; non-smoker; I drink a few times a year; normal cholestoral; not diabetic; slim build; low-normal blood pressure.

697,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello everybody; Ok im a 23 year old male; weigh 290 but have been losing weight (i was 326 now im 290) i was diagnosed with High Blood Pressure about 6 months ago; i was running at about 160/85; Im taking metropolol 75 mg; bennicar 20 mg altough i was taking 25 mg of atenolol before the cardiologist put me on metropolol instead. Ive been having constant chest pain around my chest area; soetimes right in the middle or on the left side or left side by my ribcage. Its very disconcerning because each episode last about a couple seconds and is a sharp almost stabbing pain. My doctor has ahad blood work done on me and they found high cholesterol and slightly abnormal liver functions; it used to be that i had these pains maybe once or twice a week but now its daily; ive gone to the urgent care 5 times; er 2 times; etc; they all did ekg's and they all came back negative. Ive seen a cardiologist who did a ecchocardiogram and a stress test revealed nothing; my primary doctor also did a ct scan of my abdomen and pelvis and ct scan of my chest; also revealing nothing abnormal. I sometimes get this weird feeling of fullness around my nipple area wich is disconcerning. All doctors that have seen me have ruled out any heart problems; no mvp; no arrythmyas but it seems like its always around my chest area sometimes it might originate from the middle of my chest an feel it go trough to my back. The other thing i have noticed is when i go to slep at night it seems like i cnt sleep; and when i wake up my heart is pounding like if i just ran a marathon.

698,Atenolol+hypertension,Im 47 yr old very overweight female. I have yearly physicals..just had one a few days ago. Have generalized anxiety..panic attacks. Hypertension..although am on Atenolol; which keeps my bp nearly normal...last Thurs it was 120/80.. recently developed GERD....and am on prilosec for that...other than that; and being overweight...oh; and have benign palpitations that Ive had for 20 years...other than those things; Im really healthy. Ive talked to my Dr and she is all for me starting a walking exercise program. UGH. But I am serious about doing it. The thing is..about a week ago ( before I started walking) I notice when I walk even a short distance...or when I take the basement stairs up; I get a tightness in my chest..not really my chest though..more in my stomach area...in the center..at the base of my breastbone..not between the breasts even.Slightly below that area. Its weird. I do not have it when Im sitting still--and since this is one of my personal symtoms of anxiety...I have been just ignoring it...as much as I can. When I started my walking program on Friday...wow; when i walked the first half block ..it felt like I had a brick there..in that area..but the more I walked..the less I felt it. At the end of my walk..I have no chest tightness at all..that whole feeling is gone. I cant even say that when Im having that tightness; that I am short of breath; because I am NOT really. No pain of any kind...its just like somebody blew up a balloon inside me; in that area...how weird; huh? Almost exactly a year ago to today; I had a complete cardiac workup..echo; ekg...stress test...because of the palpitations..and everything was perfect.

700,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have a question I hope someone will be able to answer. In the next few months I am hoping to receive a class 1 medical clearance for employment purposes. I was diagnosed with SVT in July 2007; but it is now perfectly controlled with medicine (atenolol; which I also take to control my high blood pressure). It was only diagnosed as I was going through an extremely stressful time in my life and was having roughly 10 small arrythmia episodes per day which prompted me to see a cardiologist . Since then; I have maybe 2-3 a month that last 5 seconds or less. They are more of a nuisance than anything else. My cardiologist never seems concerned about it. I know that medical clearances are granted for controlled hypertension; so I am not worried about that part of my medical history. But I am a bit nervous I will be denied because of my SVT. Does anyone know if medical clearances are typically denied for people with SVT; even if it is controlled with medication? Many thanks for any input.,2010,2010,,Male,hello i question i hope someon abl answer in next month i hope receiv class 1 medic clearanc employ purpos i diagnos svt juli 2007 perfect control medicin atenolol i also take control high blood pressur it diagnos i go extrem stress time life rough 10 small arrythmia episod per day prompt see cardiologist sinc i mayb 23 month last 5 second less they nuisanc anyth els my cardiologist never seem concern i know medic clearanc grant control hypertens i worri part medic histori but i bit nervous i deni svt doe anyon know medic clearanc typic deni peopl svt even control medic mani thank input
701,Atenolol+hypertension,"hello. Something very scary happened at 3am this morning my mom sat up in bed and was going to go the the toilet to pee like she always does and then her stomach felt weired; and she passed out; my dad was unable to wake her; he checked for breathing she was breathing; he called 911; when she came to she the last thing she remembered was sitting on the edge of her bed. she went to ER by ambulance; where they found she was hypotensive and tachycardic; they took blood everything was fine except her potassium and sodium were both markedly low. They assumed she was dehydrated; but she drinks a lot of water. This is unusual becuase my mom has been hyPERtenstive for as long as I can remember and takes 100mg of atenolol and 25mg of HCTZ every day becuase without it her BP would be dangerously high and she has a history of hypertension and stroke on her side of the family. She also has never passed out in her life; she will be 62 in june. She also takes a daily calcium supplement; a multivite and fish oil. her ekg was fine but they are keeping her overnight and are going to also do an echo and some other tests. she also had a fever of 101.2 and they just gave her tylenol and ibuprofin I am also worried becuase she was an avid user of darvon (not darvocet with tylenol; just darvon) and took it for a long time for her artritis pain. in novemeber the FDA removed it from the market due to cardiac risks. But I was reading about the recall; and on several sites including webmd they quoted Gerald Dal Pan; MD; MHS; director of the FDA's office of surveillance and epidemiology saying; ""Long-term users should not worry: The heart effects are not cumulative;"" he says. ""Once people stop using propoxyphene; the side (should go away."" I am really worried (becuase she's my mom shes my rock shes my everything and thats what I do) does anyone feel like playing doctor for me? any ideas why this is happening? does it sound like an infection? or auto immune? or did she actually maybe have a heart attack? or a reaction to something she ingested? also; she is a visiting nurse and goes into half a dozen sick peoples houses every day and also sees patients in assisted living homes. please maybe throw out some ideas I am just really scared and worried I love my mom more than anyone else in this whole world she is the most selfless person and if anything bad happened to her now; I don't know how I would go on living. she was fine yesterday and last night when she went to bed. thanks",2009,2011,24.0,Female,hello someth scari happen 3am morn mom sat bed go go toilet pee like alway stomach felt weir pass dad unabl wake check breath breath call 911 came last thing rememb sit edg bed went er ambul found hypotens tachycard took blood everyth fine except potassium sodium mark low they assum dehydr drink lot water this unusu becuas mom hypertenst long i rememb take 100mg atenolol 25mg hctz everi day becuas without bp would danger high histori hypertens stroke side famili she also never pass life 62 june she also take daili calcium supplement multivit fish oil ekg fine keep overnight go also echo test also fever 1012 gave tylenol ibuprofin i also worri becuas avid user darvon darvocet tylenol darvon took long time artriti pain novemeb fda remov market due cardiac risk but i read recal sever site includ webmd quot gerald dal pan md mhs director fdas offic surveil epidemiolog say longterm user worri the heart effect cumul say onc peopl stop use propoxyphen side go away i realli worri becuas shes mom shes rock shes everyth that i anyon feel like play doctor idea happen sound like infect auto immun actual mayb heart attack reaction someth ingest also visit nurs goe half dozen sick peopl hous everi day also see patient assist live home pleas mayb throw idea i realli scare worri i love mom anyon els whole world selfless person anyth bad happen i dont know i would go live fine yesterday last night went bed thank

704,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 23 year old male; in generally good health except that I was recently diagnosed with hypertension. I am a high-stress individual. The problem started when I noticed every time I had even a sip of coffee I felt like I was going to pass out. This was strange because I drank coffee heavily since I was probably 12 or so. This began about 3 months after I quit using cocaine; which I had used for about 9 - 11 months. Not something I'm proud of but that's the way it is. I have since been to a cardiologist; and had an echo-cardiogram; various blood tests (to check for ACS and clots; thyroid; etc.); chest CT; 24 - hour monitor and will have a stress test in a couple of days. I have been taking atenolol for about 6 months or so now; with moderate success. But; I still cannot have even more than a taste of coffee; or any caffeinated product. I used to smoke marijuana regularly with no problems and only in the last few months have I also become unable to do this as well. Every time I get a greatly elevated HR and similar sensations that i do from caffeine; which again is strange given my historical record with it. I don't use it regularly; but this development is still strange. My cardiologist doesn't really know what to tell me; other than everything is fine. All these things; in my mind; do not tell me that I am fine. I also have chronic chest pains that are centralized at the mid-base of my left rib cage and seem to be movement related; but have persisted off and on in the same location for about a year now. Any suggestions?,2008,2008,,,i 23 year old male general good health except i recent diagnos hypertens i highstress individu the problem start i notic everi time i even sip coffe i felt like i go pass this strang i drank coffe heavili sinc i probabl 12 this began 3 month i quit use cocain i use 9 11 month not someth im proud that way i sinc cardiologist echocardiogram various blood test check ac clot thyroid etc chest ct 24 hour monitor stress test coupl day i take atenolol 6 month moder success but i still even tast coffe caffein product i use smoke marijuana regular problem last month i also becom unabl well everi time i get great elev hr similar sensat caffein strang given histor record i dont use regular develop still strang my cardiologist doesnt realli know tell everyth fine all thing mind tell i fine i also chronic chest pain central midbas left rib cage seem movement relat persist locat year ani suggest
705,Atenolol+hypertension,Does anyone knows what causes LVH? I was told that I had HBP in 1998 and it's been uncontrollable ever since the doctor switched me from Inderal to Atenolol. He told me that Inderal was for geriatrics; but it was the only medicine that kept my BP under total control. Is LVH congential? One of my brothers had a valve replacement last year; we've always knew that he had this problem ever since he was little. The doctors always would tell our parents that my brother had a whole in his valve which caused the blood to squirt out into the chest cavity and that his valve will eventually fail when he gets older. The reason why I ask is LVH congenitial is becaue I was just diagnosed with it after I had an echo done. Then I had an pulmonary test done to check for COPD and/or asthma and was told I had neither one; but diagnosed me with CHF. Does anyone know how serious LVH and CHF is and are the reversible?

706,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 28 year old female; and mother of 2 young kids. After the labor & delivery of my first child 6 years ago; I developed high BP and what seemed to be a faster heartbeat. I am kind of an anxious person; so I attributed the heartbeat to that. I went to my PCP over the BP and he diagnosed anxiety related hypertension; and didn't think I needed to see a cardiologist. So I took Atenolol; and was then switched to Toprol XL to control the BP; which it seemed to do. I had an EKG in '03 and that was normal I was told. Fast forward to 2008; and I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd child. The OB/GYN I was seeing put me on labetalol; and never referred me to a cardiologist. After the delivery of the baby (I had a c-section); I lost a lot of blood; and the OB doctor wouldn't give me the BP meds for a few days as my BP was low. While in the hospital my heart rate got up to 144 at one point. I recently went to a new PCP as my old one left his practice; and the new one put me back on Toprol XL. He'd performed an EKG in '08 while I was pregnant; and it was normal. Yesterday I went to the new PCP I've been seeing; and he did another EKG. This time he said it showed a non specific abnormality. He diagnosed sinus tachycardia as my HR can get high. He is a very ""scattered brain"" doctor though. He can't seem to remember anything I tell him; and I think he's a flat out ""quack!"" Has any other women had similar heart symptoms after childbirth - high BP with racing heart? Can EKG's very so much between only a few months? What are non specific abnormalities on EKG's? I'm an LPN; but the heart isn't my specialty; and it's been a while since nursing school.

707,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently had this test because sometimes when I walk fast I get shortness of breath and squeezing in my chest and back Myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging revealed a partially reversible anterior defect; quantitaively equivocal..Left ventricular global function at post stress was normal with an ejection fraction of 60%.Gated wall motion analysis revealed normall wall motion and normal thickeniing of all myocardial segments. Left ventricular transient cavity dilatation was not observed. There was no abnormal lun uptake of radioisotoe. The quality of the study was suboptimal due to severe atenutation from a BMI of 51. Anterior ischemia can not be excluded. In view of the risk factor profile; family history of cvd; marked obesity; dysipedemia; hypertension; sedentary lifestyle; poor functional capacity and equivocal SPECT perfusion studym PET scan is advised. Maximal stress test to a heart rate of 134 bpm or 85% of predicted maximum for age 64 Typical anginal symptoms did not occur. The ekg response was negagtive for inducible ischemial. The blood pressure response to exercise was appropiate with a hypertensive baseline. The patient's functional capacity was markedly decreased. My doctor wants me to use nitro patch and mentioned maybe a Pet scan he said would take time . I am not comfortable to use nitro because I live alone and my bp may drop low and it could make me dizzy. I am seeing my doctor tomorrow; I am takin atenolol maxzide kdur and multivitamin lipitor and baby aspirin. Baseline ekg before test was normal sinus rhythm heart rate 81 and bp 144/70. I am concerned the doctor said it was slighty abnormal and not definitive. He said I could have a blockage of 70%. Can you clarify this test and his answer.

710,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 53 yr. female; who started experiencing continual pulse rates of 100+. After having a family doctor that wrote this off to ""white coat syndrome""; I switched to an internist. She 1st placed me on Atenolol 50 mg; which I could not tolerate; & even reducing it to 25 mg I could not sleep; had asthmatic problems; & Raynoud's syndrome. My BP was usually either normal or prehypertensive range for the last two years. I am 5'9"" & 185 lbs. I exercise by walking my dog 2 miles a day & do weight lifting at least once a week. I am now on Diltiazem 240 mg. The internist increased it from 120 mg; when I was having spikes of 140/90 with BP. It appears that the higher dosage is now controlling the BP (this morning it was 110/69) but not necessarily the pulse rate (was up to 99 yesterday afternoon). I am on a 30 day cardiac monitor that was started on 1/23/08. I had one ''event"" of pulse of 120 that went back to high 90's after an hour. My cholesterol was 225; trigylycerides in normal range; with LDL of 159 & HDL of 49. I do not have a family history of any heart disease. I do not smoke & never have. I have one glass of red wine a day. Because my husband developed high BP & then A-fib; we have been eating a low fat; high fiber diet for over a year. I had rheumatic fever as a child; but doctors have not heard a heart murmur for years. Up until now I have been very healthy all of my adult life. I have a B.S. in medical technology. As scientist; I am not satisfied with just taking medicine. I really want to understand the WHY! My internist says that if the Diltiazem is not controlling my tachycardia by the end of this week; she will refer me to a cardiologist. She said that she doesn't have as many drugs to work with; with a high pulse rate as she does with someone who just has high BP.

711,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 28 year old with an AAIR pacemaker implanted for three sinus node ablations for IST that left me with a junctional rhythm.Pacemaker has been functioning very well and have been feeling great since it was implanted in Nov. 2004.Over the passt 3-4 weeks I have had a lot of fatigue; weakness and a lot of lightheadedness.I occasionally feel short of breath at times.My cardiologist checked the pacemaker and said everything was functioning fine and also check an echo(was normal) and all basic labwork(all normal).My pacemaker check did reveal that my heart rate was not getting past 90; so they made some adjustments to the rate respone feature.I am very; very active and run and do cardiovascular exercise 3-5 times/week for an hour.I am just very; very exhausted now and feel so much different than I did.BP's have been normal.I feel absolutley wiped out after my workouts now; instead of good after them like I used to.I am going to a pulmonary dr. to rule anything with my lungs out.Cardiologist thought maybe my BP was low. Checked it at home and readings were lying-109/69; hr-79; sitting 117/75; hr-75; standing 134/78; hr-74.Shouldn't my HR go up as I stand up?Do you think this is pacemaker related? Should I have them try to reprogram my pacemaker on a treadmill or check it further? Does this sound like a pacemaker syndrome; or would that show up on an EKG?Cardiologist had me increase my salt intake with thought that BP was low; but it appears normal?Should I just ignore my symptoms and move on?I feel bad to keep pestering my dr.No other medical problems in my history.Thanks,2004,2006,,,i 28 year old aair pacemak implant three sinus node ablat ist left junction rhythmpacemak function well feel great sinc implant nov 2004over passt 34 week i lot fatigu weak lot lightheadednessi occasion feel short breath timesmi cardiologist check pacemak said everyth function fine also check echowa normal basic labworkal normalmi pacemak check reveal heart rate get past 90 made adjust rate respon featurei activ run cardiovascular exercis 35 timesweek houri exhaust feel much differ i didbp normali feel absolutley wipe workout instead good like i use toi go pulmonari dr rule anyth lung outcardiologist thought mayb bp low check home read lying10969 hr79 sit 11775 hr75 stand 13478 hr74shouldnt hr go i stand updo think pacemak relat should i tri reprogram pacemak treadmil check doe sound like pacemak syndrom would show ekgcardiologist increas salt intak thought bp low appear normalshould i ignor symptom move oni feel bad keep pester drno medic problem historythank
712,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi again! I have written several times here and I want to make sure that all of the doctors on this forum are greatly appreciated! I was just wondering how long a beta blocker like Atenelol stays in the blood stream! I am going off of it because it has been making my asthma worse! However; I have been experiencing tachycardia as I go off the Atenelol! How long does the transition usually last and can it be dangerous? i only take 12 1/2 mg in the am and again in the pm. I think this is a low dose anyway! Also does this low dose usually cause asthma problems? I almost hate going off the Atenelol because it has helped my tachycardia (caused from anxiety) a lot! I also have a prescription for KLonopin. Could this hel pwith the tachycardia in place of the Atenelol? Is Klonopin and Atenelol safe to use together since they both lower heart rate? My doctor assured me it was safe! Thanks again! You all have been a lot of help to me and my hypochondria!!! :) Jamie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Jamie: The dose of atenolol you are on is low. Nevertheless; I would favor tapering the dose over a few days; such as by stopping the evening dose for a few days; and then stopping altogether. However; you should discuss the specifics of stopping the medicine with your own doctor; and do what he tells you to. Even this low dose can cause asthma to worsen. Stopping atenolol abruptly can cause problems; but usually in people that have angina or hypertension. It should be safe to use Klonopin and atenolol together. Klonopin is an anti-anxiety medication and is not directly a treatment for tachycardia. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Only your doctor can provide specific diagnoses and treatments. If you would like to be seen at the Cleveland Clinic; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment at Desk F15 with a cardiologist.,1998,1998,,,hi i written sever time i want make sure doctor forum great appreci i wonder long beta blocker like atenelol stay blood stream i go make asthma wors howev i experienc tachycardia i go atenelol how long transit usual last danger take 12 12 mg pm i think low dose anyway also low dose usual caus asthma problem i almost hate go atenelol help tachycardia caus anxieti lot i also prescript klonopin could hel pwith tachycardia place atenelol is klonopin atenelol safe use togeth sinc lower heart rate my doctor assur safe thank you lot help hypochondria jami dear jami the dose atenolol low nevertheless i would favor taper dose day stop even dose day stop altogeth howev discuss specif stop medicin doctor tell even low dose caus asthma worsen stop atenolol abrupt caus problem usual peopl angina hypertens it safe use klonopin atenolol togeth klonopin antianxieti medic direct treatment tachycardia inform provid general purpos onli doctor provid specif diagnos treatment if would like seen cleveland clinic pleas call 1800ccfcare appoint desk f15 cardiologist

715,Atenolol+hypertension,I have frequent PVC's and bigeminy; but the past 2 days my heart has been extra irritated it seems. I am getting all sorts of PVC's; my heart rate is about 20 beats faster per minute than what it normally is; and I have had several episodes the past 2 days where it seems to pause and then speed up fast for a few seconds. I am coming down with a cold today and feel kind of achey. Anyone else experience similar things when they get a cold?

In the evening is also when the next Atenolol dosage is due. Why do I seem to be prone to developing arrhythmias at my age; & now after 5 years no problems?

718,Atenolol+hypertension,My 12 y/o son just started suffering from exercise induced SVT 2 days in a row he went into SVT rate of 240 bpm lasting a few hours. The first day he needed 6 mg of Adenosine the second it broke on its own after lying down on the litter in the ambulance. I am a paramedic and so is his father neither one of us is very familiar with children suffering from SVT. We are going to see a pediatric cardiologist on Monday and I would like to have some ideas in my head as to actions. I have been doing a bunch of reading and it appears radiofrequency ablation is the best option however I have not seen very much on children. Do you think it is safe for children or are medications a better route?

719,Atenolol+hypertension,34 year old mother of two with a history of minor restrictive lung disease of unknown origin; hereditary fatty liver & sinus tachycardia. Symptoms of breathlessness have increased and sudden onset of muscle weakness; muscle atrophy of both arms; and muscle spasms from head to toe as well as severe pain in arms/ shoulders. Have been evaluated by primary doctor and labs revealed low Vit B so I have recd 1 mo of shots. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated and potasium low. Shoulder pain evaluated and ruled out pinced nerve through MRI of cervical spine. MRI showed reverse lardosis (backward or no curve of neck) and 3 bulging discs which they say is not enough to cause my muscle problems. Sent by Orthopedic Specialist to Neurologist who suspected Vitamin B culprit for muscle weakness. Have an appt to see him again next week. The only other weird thing is that they are having lots of trouble taking blood and were unable to find a vein to administer CT contrast in. My veins clot up easily and despite regular fluid intake and my fingers appear very dehydrated (odd shaped and look like they have been in water- very wrinkly). This has not ever been a problem in the past nor have the muscles had such issues. Meanwhile; visited Pulmonologist to receive update on lung capacity- dropped from mid 70's to mid 60's. Completed lung function tests including CT of chest. Results pending. The only other thing I know is that today my oxygen level fell below 85 during mild exercise test. Have an appt to see heart specialist Fri and have been struggling with elevated heart rate despite being on beta blocker already. My meds include: Atenolol; HCTZ (fluid retention for years); Norvasc (for chest pain); Potasium supplements; Flexeril (muscle spasms); and PRN of Percocet (about 1 tab every other day to get a break from pain in arms. Any advice would be helpful on questions to ask doctor or tests to request. Thank you so much for any help you can offer!

720,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26yo female around 15-20pounds overweight. I have slightly to high blood pressure (usually around 135 / 90) and my resting heart rate is usually around 85-90. When I exercise my heart rate goes waaaaaay up. Just while walking 1.5 mile (in 30min) my heart rate went all the way up to 182bpm. The average herat rate was 143bpm. When I'm doing something a little bit more extreme it can go up to 200 and the average is around 160bpm. Should I be worried about this or is it just because I'm a little out of shape? My resting heart rate has always been around 90bpm even if I've been in a realy good shape. And should I just walk for now or is it ok to do something more difficult like ice-hockey or jogging? Is it possible that I have POTs? When I sit my heart rate is 85-90 but when I stand up it goes to 120 within 2 minutes but than it goes down to around 110. Thanks! :),2010,2011,,,hi im 26yo femal around 1520pound overweight i slight high blood pressur usual around 135 90 rest heart rate usual around 8590 when i exercis heart rate goe waaaaaay just walk 15 mile 30min heart rate went way 182bpm the averag herat rate 143bpm when im someth littl bit extrem go 200 averag around 160bpm should i worri im littl shape my rest heart rate alway around 90bpm even ive reali good shape and i walk ok someth difficult like icehockey jog is possibl i pot when i sit heart rate 8590 i stand goe 120 within 2 minut goe around 110 thank
721,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been taking Metoprolol Tartrate at various strengths for many years. I contined to take it following my ablation two and a half years ago on the advice of my PCP as a measure of safety against hypertension and heart attack survivability should one ever occur. I have leveled out on 75mg per day. I see my PCP every six months and I've noticed that each time I go; my blood pressure drops lower and lower. On my last visit several days ago; my BP was measured twice to be sure and it was 102/60. My physician didn't say anything; but I was wondering the following: The half life of Metoprolol results in a residulal amount remaining when the next dose occurs. This repeats over and over for months .... years. I would think this could cause a gradual build-up of the drug to possible very high levels. We all know that Metoprolol lowers blood pressure. Could this be the reason for my low normal readings? I still workout and skate very hard and have noticed lately that my heart is slower to respond to physical demands and that I can't get my peak heart rate above 185bpm. Any ideas?,2010,2013,,Male,ive take metoprolol tartrat various strength mani year i contin take follow ablat two half year ago advic pcp measur safeti hypertens heart attack surviv one ever occur i level 75mg per day i see pcp everi six month ive notic time i go blood pressur drop lower lower on last visit sever day ago bp measur twice sure 10260 my physician didnt say anyth i wonder follow the half life metoprolol result residul amount remain next dose occur this repeat month year i would think could caus gradual buildup drug possibl high level we know metoprolol lower blood pressur could reason low normal read i still workout skate hard notic late heart slower respond physic demand i cant get peak heart rate 185bpm ani idea
722,Atenolol+hypertension,hello doctor; i am 24 years oldfor the past 5 years i consistently exercises 5-6 times a week combined with cardio and heavy lifting. i am 162 pounds 5'8 im am probably 7% body fat; i do not take steroids or take anything bad. i do not smoke or drink. I am in nursing school so balancing school; life; and work has been stressful as of late. I consulted with my doctor because i have experiencing fluctuations in my blood pressure it can get as high as 140 systolic but diastolic is within normal range (70) but when im stress free its about 116-67. It could be from stress; i told her about some issues anxiety and palpitations but my heart rate is about 50-60 most of the time. So anyway she prescribed me 1/2 mg of atenolol a day and she sent me for an echo. My blood pressure has been good since i have been on atenolol. i had the echo and here are the results which has been concerning to me. aorctic root 29; left atrium 27; LVOT 20; septum 10; posterior wall 9; LVEDD 52; LVESD 38. The study is of good technical qualtiy. The left atrium is normal in size. the left ventricle is at the upper limits of normal in size with borderline systolic function. The estimated ejection fraction is 50-55%. NO regional wall motion abnormalities were identified. The mitral valve demonstrates normal excursion. There is mild mitral valve regurge. The aorctic valve is tricuspid and is normal in appearance. There is no aortic insufficiency seen. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The right atrium appears normal is size. The tricuspid valve is normal in appearance with mild tricuspid valve regurg. The estimated PA pressure is 33 mmhg. The pulmonic valve is grossly normal in appearance with no insufficiency seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Impression: Borderline left ventricular enalrgement with low-normal systolic function Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Boderline pulmonary hypertension. Anyway she told me since i workout very much and look very muscular there could be some overexertion; i couldnt really understand why this could cause it. She wants me to have another echo in a year. She asked how i was doing on atenolol and i told her i was tolerating it well and ask me if i would like to continue to be on the drug and we both decided there is no harm into that. She told me not to worry about it but if it continues to get bigger there is a cause for concern. So i ask for a cardiologist opinion here to help me breath a little easier thank you so much..,2011,2011,24.0,Male,hello doctor 24 year oldfor past 5 year consist exercis 56 time week combin cardio heavi lift 162 pound 58 im probabl 7 bodi fat take steroid take anyth bad smoke drink i nurs school balanc school life work stress late i consult doctor experienc fluctuat blood pressur get high 140 systol diastol within normal rang 70 im stress free 11667 it could stress told issu anxieti palpit heart rate 5060 time so anyway prescrib 12 mg atenolol day sent echo my blood pressur good sinc atenolol echo result concern aorctic root 29 left atrium 27 lvot 20 septum 10 posterior wall 9 lvedd 52 lvesd 38 the studi good technic qualtiy the left atrium normal size left ventricl upper limit normal size borderlin systol function the estim eject fraction 5055 no region wall motion abnorm identifi the mitral valv demonstr normal excurs there mild mitral valv regurg the aorctic valv tricuspid normal appear there aortic insuffici seen the right ventricl normal size function the right atrium appear normal size the tricuspid valv normal appear mild tricuspid valv regurg the estim pa pressur 33 mmhg the pulmon valv grossli normal appear insuffici seen there pericardi effus impress borderlin left ventricular enalrg lownorm systol function mild mitral tricuspid regurgit boderlin pulmonari hypertens anyway told sinc workout much look muscular could overexert couldnt realli understand could caus she want anoth echo year she ask atenolol told toler well ask would like continu drug decid harm she told worri continu get bigger caus concern so ask cardiologist opinion help breath littl easier thank much
723,Atenolol+hypertension,"Dear Dr: Thanks again for a very informative and helpful site. I am a 36yr f; w/3 children and work p/t I am also on the b/c patch to control irregular cycles. This past Fri. I took my son to his bowling league. I went into the snack shop and felt tightness in my chest. I thought it was from the smokey atmosphere. No chest pain or rapid heartrate. I felt like this for the rest of the evening. Almost like not being able to take a deep breath in; that a good ""sigh"" would help. I felt like my b/p was high. I took it on Sat. and it ranged during the day from 110/75 to 130/95 mostly on the high side all day. I normally have low b/p 110/70. I have allergies and MVP by echo as mild and not meeting strict criteria from MVP but I suffer from dysautonomia. I went to a walk-in clinic on Sun. My b/p was 114/95 dr. said he would not even give the b/p readidng a 2nd thought;ekg normal; chest x-ray normal and O2 normal b/c which I have taken for the past 3 months and previously took b/c on and off for years did not feel connection. Was sent home as anxiety/stress related.I had a visit with my gp/cardio on the Weds. prior and had normal ekg and b/p. Since I feel very congested in my sinus since that time; could that cause the rise? Allergies? Does is sound stress related; the ""tight band around the chest"" feeling and tight neck muscles. Would taking a beta blocker if the rise is caused by stress; would it lower the pressure? I have atenolol to take on an as needed basis for palpitations. I am calling my dr. this a.m. to advise him what has happened. Any opinion?

725,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion.

726,Atenolol+hypertension,I ws diagnosed with high blood pressure but as far as i know i dont have it. i had it the day i went to the doctor because i was freaking out. ever since ive tested my blood pressure and its been normal. i do have a vein on my left side of the neck that bulges somewhat when i lean forward or bend down; raise my left arm and i little bit when im eating. i can see that the vein is much more superficial on that side compared to the other side. i say this because i can se where the vein is even when it is flat. also if i put my finger on it then it bulges too as if im blocking it. im pretty sure that this vein drains blood since when i cover the top nothing happens but when i cover the bottom it bulges. ive had two doctors tell me that its my carotid and that i should not worry about it. ive also heard that thin people with bigger neck muscles tend to have this sometimes and its normal. i recently lost weight and thats around when it happened. i went from 165 to about 153 or so. im in my 20s and have no other symptoms (no chest pain or shortness of breath etc..) or pains. i dont know what this could be but im kind of worried that it could be something to do with the heart. when my physician listen to my heart he said it was normal he also listened to the veins in the neck with the stethoscope. i dont know what to think. please help me out. thanks a lot;,2007,2007,,,i ws diagnos high blood pressur far know dont day went doctor freak ever sinc ive test blood pressur normal vein left side neck bulg somewhat lean forward bend rais left arm littl bit im eat see vein much superfici side compar side say se vein even flat also put finger bulg im block im pretti sure vein drain blood sinc cover top noth happen cover bottom bulg ive two doctor tell carotid worri ive also heard thin peopl bigger neck muscl tend sometim normal recent lost weight that around happen went 165 153 im 20s symptom chest pain short breath etc pain dont know could im kind worri could someth heart physician listen heart said normal also listen vein neck stethoscop dont know think pleas help thank lot
727,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Dr. I am a 33 year old male with hypertension and a bicuspid aorta. For years I have had a great deal of health anxiety (manifested in fast heart rates; occasional palpitations; maybe arrythmias? etc) and my doctors believe that anxiety is playing a role in my hypertension. I take 25mg of atenolol and 20mg of lisinopril daily and my bp readings avg about 130/85. My problem is that I'm always scared of sudden death. I'm an athlete ( I work out 4-5 times a week) and whenever I read of an athlete suddenly dying from a heart related problem; I'm sure it will also happen to me. I've worn holter monitors; get regular echos (due to bicuspid diagnosis); had stress echos; event monitors... and they've never really found anything - no stenosis; cardiomyopathy etc... So now I feel pretty comfortable that structurally my heart is fine and won't cause me problems but I still worry about an electrical problem. Would they have seen things like Brugada syndrome; or Long QT syndrome; or recognize a problem with vagal tone etc...? Should I ask to see an EP Cardiologist as well? Basically my current symptoms are occasional flutters (especially right before I fall asleep); occasional rapid heart rate that feels ""weaker"" than normal; and an accompanying sensation at the base of my neck (carotid artery? vagus nerve?)

728,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Over the course of 24 hours I was running a fever due to an infection in my leg that I am being treated for. It peaked at 102.7 or thereabouts. My heart was beating faster than normal. I'm on atenolol which normally keeps it to between 68 and 74 bpm. In the ER my heart rate was 98 and BP peaked at 134/85. Given my known condition of having a fusifom ascending aortic aneurysm of 4.1 X 4.2; dilated aortic root; enlarged heart; mitral regurgitation and overall heart enlargement as revealed by two CT scans a year apart; and three echo studies; is there a reason for greater concern?

729,Atenolol+hypertension,Glad I found this forum. I'm a 33 year old Caucasian; female. I'm 5'4; 143 lbs. I have always been kind of an anxious person... (runs in my family) After my first daughter was born in 2002; I developed high BP during the end of the pregnancy; & during labor that never really went away. I have been on BP medicine since. I've been diagnosed with primary hypertension & sinus tachycardia. I currently take Bystolic 5 mg once daily. Used to take atenolol and Toprol for BP; but they didn't work well for me. I also used to take Zoloft for anxiety; but had to stop due to weight gain. Plus; my anxiety got better and I really didn't need it anymore. I see a cardiologist every 6 months for the BP & tachycardia. I had a stressful year last year and my anxiety started to come back. Just recently I have developed panic attacks; so to speak. Whenever I get a little nervous about a situation; the nervousness can develop in to a panic attack. The last two times I've went to the doctor I started to get nervous (white coat syndrome) & my BP and heart rate skyrocketed. My BP was 153/112; pulse was 126. I talked to my cardiologist about this; but he thought I was probably find unless my BP was staying consistently elevated which it doesn't; once the panic attack is over. With the BP medicine; my BP is about 120/81; pulse 77 normally. I have had normal EKG's; echos; and a normal 24 hour heart monitor and blood work. Cardiologist has listened to heart and lungs and says normal. My anxiety seems to be doing this. I get so anxious my BP and HR go up drastically. My cardiologist wrote me 10 mg Celexa to try for the anxiety; but I'm afraid it will make me gain weight like the Zoloft. I was just wondering any others in their 20s or 30s with anxiety dealing with these kind if symptoms with their anxiety? Anyone take celexa? If so did cause weight gain?

730,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been in the hospital 2 time with a-fib. The first time I was drinking and running around out on an island and my heart started going crazy. They were able to get it back to normal in the ICU and I was on meds for a few months. The second time (1 year and 1/2 later) I was laying in bed and my leg cramped and I had an episode. Again; they got it under control and informed me that because I have had issues in the past I was 80% more likely to have it again. My current cardiologist has me in a daily dose of Metoprorol and baby asprin. I have been on this for over 2 years now and they have not changed anything. Is there long term side effects and am I too young to be on this regiment?,2014,2014,,Male,i hospit 2 time afib the first time i drink run around island heart start go crazi they abl get back normal icu i med month the second time 1 year 12 later i lay bed leg cramp i episod again got control inform i issu past i 80 like my current cardiologist daili dose metoprorol babi asprin i 2 year chang anyth is long term side effect i young regiment
731,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 27 year old female & I started having BP problems about a year ago (at least that's when I first found out). I am now on 3 medications a day (Atenolol; Methalydopa; Hydrochlorizide). I take 50mg; 250mg; 25mg of the above meds. My BP is still about where it was when I first started taking the meds. It ranges from 135-160/90-117. High BP runs in my family; but no one else has seemed to have such a problem getting it under control. I have had my kidneys tested & some blood work (Cholesterol & Trig. are a little high; but not too bad). I have had one ekg with nothing found; and I am scheduled for another. I am a little overweight (180lbs...I find it difficult to lose the weight); but don't know if there is anything else that might be causing the problem. I try to watch my sodium intake; I quite drinking Caffine; & I ocassionaly drink alcohol. I excercise regularly. My dr. acts like it is abnormal to have such a problem at my age that the meds aren't able to control. She doesn't want to get me on too much medicine b/c of my age & if I would choose to have a child. Is there anything else I should be looking into as a possible cause; or do I just chalk this up as a hereditary disease & go with it? After my last Dr. Apt; she scheduled me an apt. with a cardiologist. Just looking to see if there is you have any advice.,2006,2006,,,i 27 year old femal i start bp problem year ago least that i first found i 3 medic day atenolol methalydopa hydrochlorizid i take 50mg 250mg 25mg med my bp still i first start take med it rang 13516090117 high bp run famili one els seem problem get control i kidney test blood work cholesterol trig littl high bad i one ekg noth found i schedul anoth i littl overweight 180lbsi find difficult lose weight dont know anyth els might caus problem i tri watch sodium intak i quit drink caffin i ocassionali drink alcohol i excercis regular my dr act like abnorm problem age med arent abl control she doesnt want get much medicin bc age i would choos child is anyth els i look possibl caus i chalk hereditari diseas go after last dr apt schedul apt cardiologist just look see advic

734,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 39 yr old male with permenant A-fib. I was put on metatropal and dijoxin 2 1/2 years ago. Doctor changed the beta to a calcium channel blocker a year ago and my exercise tolerance improved greatly. Recently ; after completing a marathon training program; my HR was 39 bpm in his office; so I was pulled off the Dij. After a month off dij; a holter found my HR was down to 35 at night with periods of 3.7 second pauses. This led to being switched to a beta blocker that has a pacing effect built in. I now find it difficult to run over six miles; due to difficulty in getting full breaths. 1) Is it generally harder to exercise on a beta rather than a calcium channel blocker? 2)Do they make a CC blocker that has the pacing effect (drops out on the low end)? 3)At what point do the long pauses pose a problem? 4)Am I better living with the high heart rate (180 to 220 during activity) or the low; since I have never felt real detrimental effects from either?,2001,2002,,,i 39 yr old male permen afib i put metatrop dijoxin 2 12 year ago doctor chang beta calcium channel blocker year ago exercis toler improv great recent complet marathon train program hr 39 bpm offic i pull dij after month dij holter found hr 35 night period 37 second paus this led switch beta blocker pace effect built i find difficult run six mile due difficulti get full breath 1 is general harder exercis beta rather calcium channel blocker 2do make cc blocker pace effect drop low end 3at point long paus pose problem 4am i better live high heart rate 180 220 activ low sinc i never felt real detriment effect either

737,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm new to this forum. I am in a complicated ""pickle"" I guess you could say. I am a 21 year old male with hypertension but for the most part it is under control via medications. I have been having shortness of breath; chest pain(less often); and chest tightness in the center of the chest. This has started about 7 months ago. Since then; about 5-6 months ago; I had an ultrasound of the heart(I don't know the exact name of it; it is better than a stress test and has a 99% accuracy rate) by a good rated cardiologist; MRI's MRA's of my body including ultrasound of the abdomen; gall bladder tests; a 48-hour Holter monitor test(normal); Seen a pulmonologist; had a spirometer (everything is normal); Saw a GI specialist had an endoscopy; and a barium swallow. Polyps were found and removed. Biopsies came back normal other than some inflammation of the stomach. Since symptoms started I have been to the ER about 6 times also; everything was normal sent home every time. But here's the catch. I still have random chest pains in the center or just to the left of my chest; and when I get emotionally into a song; video game; or say a movie; my chest tightens up in the center and it really scares me. My doctor and pretty much all of my specialists insist they think I'm fine without further investigation. Furthermore; I have shortness of breath pretty much the whole day as I have been since all of this started. And recently; hours after drinking alcohol and sleeping; I awake with palpitations which has never happened to me before. Also in the past month I have been diagnosed with bronchitis; then I had a sinus infection; and now I have a virus which is kinda peculiar I've never been this consecutively sick and I don't know if my shortness of breath is because all of this. I pretty much have no life anymore because I don't know what's wrong with me and I pretty much am in fear of dying all of the time because all of this chest discomfort. If this isn't my heart; I'm convinced it's stomach related? I'm sick of every doctor saying it's anxiety I'm not even generally an anxious person. Please any suggestions? I don't know who to turn to my doctor seems almost annoyed with me with all of these symptoms.

739,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted by Susan on April 21; 1999 at 19:51:11 Hi; I have always suffered with social anxiety in particular situations. I am in college; and the situations which cause me to have excessive anxiety are many. Not only do I experience dread and apprehension at the thought of speaking/participating in class; but my heart also pounds uncontrollably when I am required to speak in public. I started taking Zoloft to control the anxiety (4 weeks ago); but my heart still races--up to 130bpm. My doctor gave me Atenolol(25mg) to take as needed; and I notice a wonderful decrease in the physical symptoms of my anxiety when I take it. Also; I've always been concerned with a generally high pulse rate;It is frequently at 100bpm at rest. My doctor says that it's possibly anxiety related. I've been taking the Atenolol over the last few days when I don't have a perfomance issue because it brings my pulse down into the 80's. I like it because I don't have that sense of awareness about my heart--it's not pounding while I'm just sitting and relaxing. A friend recently told me that beta-blockers can be dangerous; and that I should rethink taking them. Now I'm worried. Have I made a mistake in taking them for non-preformance related heart racing? What are the dangers of Atenolol? Are there specific concerns for taking a beta-blocker on an as-needed basis? Thank you for any information. Susan Posted by HFHS.MD.D.E. on April 27; 1999 at 09:55:19 Dear susan; The two most widely used medications for specific social phobia associated with performance situations are Atenolol and Propranolol. These medications are also indicated for hypertension;cardiac disease and certain types of arrythmias and can help with the physical symptoms (heart racing) in patients with social phobia. The potential side effects include fatigue; nightmares;and bradycardia. If you have undergone a thorough medical evaluation and were given clearance by your primary care physician; then there should be no reason for concern. You might discuss with your physician the reasons for your rapid heart rate; which can be secondary to a number of underlying diseases such as thyroid disease. Atenolol is an appropiate medication for performance anxiety and it seems that it has been of help to you. For patients with generalized social phobia; antidepressants such as Zoloft are the treatment of choice. You have only been on Zoloft for 4 weeks and it might take longer than that for you to start feeling the benefits of this medication. I hope this information was helpful to you. It is however intended for general information only and is not a substitute for a medical consultation.

740,Atenolol+hypertension,I had occasional tachycardia from anxiety before becoming pregnant. During the last 4 months of pregnancy my resting pulse stayed between 90-120 bpm; but I did not have hypertension until the last couple of weeks and it was only 144/85 and 135/91. In the couple of days after giving birth I got a UTI at the hospital and my blood pressure rose to 155/106. I was watched for postpartum pre-eclampsia a few days and released only to be admitted to a closer hospital that evening with a bp of 166/115. My pulse had dropped into the 70-80's after birth; but I began taking Lopressor to lower bp. My cardiologist added Norvasc after the 166/115 trip to the hospital. My bp soon came down to 90/70s. I was told to stop Norvasc and then Lopressor. I watched for a rebound but my bp and pulse were within a normal range for a few weeks without them. I continued to check my bp about every day. One day a relative said something very cruel to me at the exact moment I was taking my bp. My diastolic was 110; but systolic and pulse were normal. My diastolic wouldn't come down so I took Clonidine (as my dr had prescribed for an emergency.) I almost fainted numerous times and was very frightened for my daughter because we were then alone. I never wanted to take it again. My cardiologist told me to take Norvasc again. My bp has been under control since then; but the diastolic always rises dramatically instead of my pulse when there's a lot of stress. My resting pulse has remained lower than 80; sometimes dropping into the 50s. I gave birth 9 months ago. My bp has been dropping into the 90/70s for over a month so I was cutting down the Norvasc slowly. My daughter is recovering from RSV and bronchiolitis. I've had a cold for about a week now. A few days ago I checked my bp and pulse before sleep and they were normal. When I awoke my bp was as expected but my pulse was 104. My pulse has been consistantly elevated since then. I went to an urgent care that evening and my pulse was 111. I had a normal EKG except for tachycardia; but an xray of one of my lungs showed infection. He didn't know if it was viral or bacterial so he gave me a script for a Zpak. I'm feeling much more energy and am drinking a lot of water. My pulse is still really high; mostly when I wake. My bp is still 90/70s when waking; but rises to 104/80(ish) in the evening. My cardiologist is on a month long vacation. I don't know if I should be concerned about the sudden tachycardia or anything I mentioned before. I don't feel sick except feeling my heart beat so fast at rest. I've also lost 4 pounds in the last week. Years ago I was diagnosed with 3 leaky heart valves; but an echo months ago said there were no leaks. I've previously worn a heart monitor that recorded tachycardia and PACs or PVCs but nothing significant to the dr.

Lived on benadryl for next couple yrs. NEVER HAD ALLERGIES PRIOR TO THIS. age ~42; headaches waking me at 4-5am daily-went to a cardiologist. Placed on Hyzaar 50-12.5 Had one of those suction cup upper arm tests at a heath fair that said I was 50% water; so I was pleased with Hyzaar's diuretic component. Little did I know....once you start it you can't get off it. Tried twice and within 36hrs ankles looked like the skin was going to pop open. Had not had this problem prior to Hyzaar. Try sleeping with your feet up on the wall. However; headaches gone and bp normal when taking Hyzaar. But now...blood sugar which had always been 100 increased to ~130. age 43; finally went to allergist; prescribed Allegra; Albuterol. Allegra instantly felt like a head cold. Stopped taking it; never filled the Albuterol. age 44; allergies worse; now experiencing episodes after moving furniture of shortness of breath/coughing attacks. Mother; retired nurse; asks if she should call 911; only half jokingly. Also now getting completely random infrequent zaps of pain with a branchlike pattern in left chest/breast/under arm-split second in nature-rarely also get one at bottom of front of neck. Normal EKG and treadmill stress test which were done by phys ther in a early diabetes prevention study I volunteered for-did quite well for awhile till work sabotaged it-lots of job stress :-) age 45; went back to allergist; ""crossed the border to mild asthma"" left with Zyrtec; Flonase; Albuterol; Epipen...overkill. Forget Flonase; tried Albuterol couple episodes; with no noticeable increase in depth of breath. However; Zyrtec is a miracle allergy drug....on a humerous side note; I had so much drainage from allergies that I hadn't had flu since allergies started. Two weeks of Zyrtec and I was a new woman; and promptly caught the flu from coworkers. age 45; 6wks after starting Zyrtec-sudden severe headache front left side of head...scary! It was a Fri at work ~11am; nauseous; tears; had nurses where I work take bp- 198/126. Called cardiolgist office; there is definitely a problem these days with voicemail/response time. 4hrs later heard from the office nurse. By then I had been taking aspirin (I know; not the treatment of choice for stroke...) and my headache had improved some; However; by late afternoon it began again. Mom looked up Hyzaar and advised me to take another Hyzaar. So that weekend I discontinued Zyrtec; took Hyzaar twice a day; and on Monday bp was 126/79. I then rtnd to Hyzaar once a day. A week later I somewhat cautiously began taking Zyrtec once every 3days. (p.s. it wasnt the Zyrtec with the extra something.) I also went back to the allergist for my 2mos fu and everything looked like before the allergies; the pft's were improved; and I left with a script for a half dose daily of Zyrtec-which they insist does not raise BP; but I had normal bp for three years on Hyzaar; normal bp week before Zyrtec started; and today I had my gyn checkup (3yrs) and bp is still higher than before Zyrtec. But Zyrtec is a miracle so as long as no headaches I will keep with it. By now your eyes are glazed over-I really do have two questions. You should also know that in 3yrs I have seen the cardiologist 4times and called once-the day of the ""stroke."" I have seen the allergist 3 times in 2yrs and called once-when I finally caught the flu I wanted to ask if the Albuterol would help with that congestion. My ""chart"" is 1/2"" thick and it contains my entire healthcare records including gyn and dental for the last 23yrs. Question 1: My insurance does not consider Hyzaar a preferred drug; and since I am no longer happy with it; are there a few bp meds you would recommend that I could compare against the ins list and then when I go see the cardiologist again I can discuss being switched to one of them? Question #2: I am heading towards those menopausal years when women catch up to men in heart attack statistics. Because of that heart ct; I am thinking ahead.

743,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Catherine F. Baker on September 27; 1998 at 15:38:26: I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending.

I have and irregular heart beat for nearly 20 years but nothing to this level. I take atenolol as well. Not sure what else to do here - maybe someone can lay out a baby step approach to this - I have kind of been doing that for myself: vitamins (magnesium); beta blockers (although the Atenolol is not working at this level so I am thinking about Inderal - any others out there that have better arrthymia suppresion); anit-arrthymic agents - the hard stuff flecanide and betapace; then ablation.

748,Atenolol+hypertension,60 yr old male recently started on Furosemide; potassium and Digoxin after having nearly eight months of atrial fibrillation accompanied by persistent coughing; weakness and panting. Should I also be on any other meds. Is it proper to attempt pharmaceutical rythm-conversion after its been so many months at 145-150 with spurts of 195 upon bending or exercise. Isn't the preferred treatment modality these days rate oriented and anti-coagulent oriented? I've been unable to get a test for H. Pylori or heavy metals; yet H. Pylori is causative for some cases of AF and my history of heavy meatal exposure is quite possibly the cause of my persistent hypertension for this past decade; but doctors would not test lead or molybdenum levels or test for pheochromocytoma as possible cause of hypertension.

750,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. I am a 32y/o male (165#)and believe that I have some type of problem with my thyroid and am finally investigating this with an endo. All of my test results are not yet back; but what I have so far is: FT4 1.4 (.7-1.7 ref range); FT3 3.1 (2.5-3.9); TSH 1.48 (.5-5.00). The tests that we are waiting on are the antibodies; metephrines; and some other hormone tests that he wanted ran. My symptoms consist of: Anxiety for most of my life with a significant increase about 10 years ago; diagnosed hypertension at about the same time as increased anxiety; irritability; often sleep for many hours at night and am still tired the next day; apathy; easily 'stressed out'; feeling of tightness in my upper chest/lower throat; decreased motivation; constipation; difficulty concentrating with forgetfullness; decreased libido; occassional blurred vision; often difficulty hearing (tv; radio; etc must be turned up louder than most people need). SSRIs for anxiety and dep have done nothing but caused side effects. I am taking 37.5mg of Atenolol for the blood pressure and rapid heart rate. When not on this I also have substantial anxious feelings (increased heart rate; tense muscles; blurred vision; etc). I also get mild chest pains and headaches during exercise when not on the beta blocker. I take Klonipin occassionally for breakthrough anxiety. My question is this: I seem to have both hyper and hypo symptoms mixed. My mother had thyroid problems. Based on my initial tests I appear to be within 'normal'. Do my symptoms sound indicative of hyper or hypo? What about the 'normal' tests?,2005,2005,,,hello i 32yo male 165and believ i type problem thyroid final investig endo all test result yet back i far ft4 14 717 ref rang ft3 31 2539 tsh 148 5500 the test wait antibodi metephrin hormon test want ran my symptom consist anxieti life signific increas 10 year ago diagnos hypertens time increas anxieti irrit often sleep mani hour night still tire next day apathi easili stress feel tight upper chestlow throat decreas motiv constip difficulti concentr forgetful decreas libido occassion blur vision often difficulti hear tv radio etc must turn louder peopl need ssris anxieti dep done noth caus side effect i take 375mg atenolol blood pressur rapid heart rate when i also substanti anxious feel increas heart rate tens muscl blur vision etc i also get mild chest pain headach exercis beta blocker i take klonipin occassion breakthrough anxieti my question i seem hyper hypo symptom mix my mother thyroid problem base initi test i appear within normal do symptom sound indic hyper hypo what normal test

754,Atenolol+hypertension,I know that this is a question that has been asked a lot but it still is confusing to me. Do pvc's after exercise mean an increase risk of cardiac problems.

I had pvc's after the stress test but my doctor didn't seem at all concerned. I also had pvc's on the holtar while at rest. When do pvc's after exercise become a problem?

756,Atenolol+hypertension,My cardiologist has put me on a betablocker because I have 18% of PVC's and sometimes SVT (not so much); He says there's a small risk of developing cardiomyopathy if they don't become less. My 24h holter monitor showed that most of the PVC's were during the day. When I'm sleeping I don't have as many. So this is probably why he thinks that my heart will respond well to beta-blockers (i'm a rather anxious person) How soon should my heart starting giving less PVC's; after starting daily beta blocker therapy ?,2014,2015,,Male,my cardiologist put betablock i 18 pvcs sometim svt much he say there small risk develop cardiomyopathi dont becom less my 24h holter monitor show pvcs day when im sleep i dont mani so probabl think heart respond well betablock im rather anxious person how soon heart start give less pvcs start daili beta blocker therapi
757,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 32 year old woman who several months ago had a modified ablation of my sinus node; which subsequently caused me to have sinus pauses of up to 7 seconds and a very slow rate. The diagnosis was sick sinus syndrome and the result a pacemaker. Now I have developed new arrythmias. When I saw my electrophysiologist recently he said I was having episodes of a-fib; as well as wide complex tachycardias. These rhythms are very frequent; almost anytime I stand to do anything. I also have two small children. My Dr.told me I would end up in a-fib all of the time. He said my choices were to have my a-v node ablated and be 100% dependant on the pacemaker; or be on various heart medications including antiarrythmics; which may not solve the prolem. I also have a P.F.O. and I'm on coumadin. He said no matter what I would have to remain on coumadin. Is this because the rhythm would still exist even with the a-v node ablation; and if this is true would it eventually weaken my heart even though I'm not feeling it. My Drs. are wonderful; and I wouldn't trade them for anything. If you have and opinions or insight I would be so grateful. This forum is wonderful. You have helped so many. Thankyou for your time.

759,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi; I'm a 40 year old male; about 6ft and 210 lbs. I recently had a heart ultrasound check at a free health screening. Everything (blood flow volumes; AAA screening) was fine. No signs of plaque or anything; but I was told that I had an IVS measurement of 1.4; which was high. I assume the 1.4 means 1.4 cm in diameter. I was told I should discuss this with my doctor at my next visit. I was then asked if I had high BP. I'll admit that I am a type ""A"" and my BP runs borderline; but I have been able to bring it down the last few years. Ten to fifteen years ago it ran between 140/150-mid 90s; but for the last few years it has been between 120/130-mid 80s. I have refused most medication except for daily dose of HCTZ because I'd like to control it by lifestyle adjustments. I also used to do a fair share of weightlifting 20 years ago. This was my first heart screening; so I have no baseline to go on. It was a free screening; so I assume there may be a fair variation rate as well. My BP was a little high during the screening; so I don't know if this should be considered as well. Q: Could you tell me what would be considered a normal IVS and how bad is this reading if I'm truly at 1.4? Is my history of borderline high BP the likely cause? Can this number vary from day to day? Can it be reduced/improved? What is the best way to improve it? I could stand to lose a few lbs and do better cardio exercise. Would this be enough or is medicine the only way to go? thanks for all your time and help",2006,2006,,,hi im 40 year old male 6ft 210 lbs i recent heart ultrasound check free health screen everyth blood flow volum aaa screen fine no sign plaqu anyth i told i iv measur 14 high i assum 14 mean 14 cm diamet i told i discuss doctor next visit i ask i high bp ill admit i type a bp run borderlin i abl bring last year ten fifteen year ago ran 140150mid 90s last year 120130mid 80s i refus medic except daili dose hctz id like control lifestyl adjust i also use fair share weightlift 20 year ago this first heart screen i baselin go it free screen i assum may fair variat rate well my bp littl high screen i dont know consid well q could tell would consid normal iv bad read im truli 14 is histori borderlin high bp like caus can number vari day day can reducedimprov what best way improv i could stand lose lbs better cardio exercis would enough medicin way go thank time help
760,Atenolol+hypertension,"Since Jan 06 have had chest pain; sqeezing & burning; occassional sob only during exercise. I have exercised 4-5 days wk for 2 years+. In Jan had thallium stress test; ecg; echo; ekg; holtor; ekg and ct scan to rule out stomach. Stress test stopped after 9 min. due to reaching max heart rate of 151. Bp was normal. Holtor showed heart rate at 195; 20 minutes into workout-with pain episode. Tried numerous meds to control hrt rate-atenolol; verapamil and now on toprol xl 50mg daily + baby asprin. My bp now fluctuates between normal 106/66-150/86 at rest. Don't know what it is during exercise. Cardio dx me with ""Stress Induced Hypertension & Tachycardia"". Says he normally sees this in a few women in teens & 20's. I'm 38. Goes away in about 5 yrs. Last wk during my spin class had no pain; but felt odd. 20 min. into class; instructor checked my pulse-10 beats normal; speed up; and stop-repeating for 2 min. Rate only 83 in very intense class. Normally about 130 now with the toprol. Has happened twice now. Still have some pain episodes. Will wear holtor again Monday. I know the hm shows the heart rates but would another stress test done at least 20 minutes be appropriate to ask for? I may or may not have an episode; but if so; would it be more likely to show what is causing the pain if it is the heart? The toprol is lowering my heart rate; but I still have pain and now these bottoming out sensations; do you have any ideas on what else could be happening? No other times; just during workouts.

762,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm now 38 weeks pregnant; been given the ok to have a vaginal delivery as they STILL after over 3 yrs cannot find the cause of my sinus tachy. It is pretty much like IST but it presented with high bp with normal thyroids etc. So I was put on beta blockers (Atenolol) which worked perfectly for both bp and heart rate in the first year; then in the summer of the second year my heart elevated again but my blood pressure remained normalized. (1st yr Heart rate on beta blockers was about 60 max except with bouts of SVT during anxiety attacks; 2nd yr it went up to between 70 and 80 at rest and has pretty much been like that since; but goes between 90 and 100 after meals). I'm now due to give birth very very soon and I'm terrified! I don't know how much the heart rate goes up by when you give birth but I hope to have an epidural so I don't feel the pain much; I've also heard that it lowers blood pressure so maybe it might help. When I gave birth to my first child I was fine and my heart rate was normal; it was 4 months after delivering him that I developed the sinus tachy with hypertension. Can anyone reassure me with the birth side of it though? Im really worried about the pain and the exertion of the labour. Also; my circulation is pretty poor (it was thought that it might have been the cause of the sinus tachy and hypertension as I developed really bad circulation over a few weeks just before they discovered the heart rate and blood pressure probs). I'm so scared as my local health care professionals don't seem to care; I'm in a small town in the UK and they just keep saying it's ""anxiety"" and that's the only answer I get!

763,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am new to the forum and have been reading many postings. I have been having a problem for the past two months where I experience skipping heart beats. I have had problems with this a few times in the past the first time was just after the birth of my daughter and then again when I was around 35 but at that time I had just lost my father to a heart attack. I've been to the ER several times in the past few months due to my palpitations and keep being told that I am having PVC's and they are not serious and I shouldn't worry. Well; tell that to someone who suffers too with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I take clonopin for the anxiety but lately it's doesn't seem to help. I also take Atenolol; 50mg. daily for the palpitations. It seems to help for about 3 hrs. and then things start up again. I also have hypertension and take atacand; norvasc; and clonidine for it. I am at a loss as to what to do. I've had a stress/echo and a couple of echocardiograms and have been told that things look good. My refraction rate is 60% and I've been told that is wonderful. So; why do I have my heart skipping beats? It is scaring me and then that adds to my anxiety which I am sure doesn't help. These palpitations are making my life miserable and I am afraid to leave the house. My life is very stressful due to my husband who is trying to recover from a serious car accident and was told just a couple of weeks ago that his broken arm isn't healing and he will need another surgey. Also; he lost his job and was forced into early retirement which cost us all our life's savings. Now we live on 60% of what my husband made when he worked. We were not prepared for this as we had 4 more years; we thought; to get our finances in order. I am a retired nurse but the places I worked never offered any kind of retirement plan so what we had in savings was what I was able to put into it from my pay checks. I am sure that the stress I am under isn't helping my heart and with heart disease in my family and having hypertension; I am scared that I am just a heart beat away from a heart attack or stroke; no pun intended. I need HELP!

765,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Ruth on January 18; 1998 at 00:41:55: I am a 47 year old female with chronic hypertension; right-sided CHF; and angina. Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?). I suffer excruciating headaches from them and have been told I have to live with them until we can find the cause of the angina. Is that true or do I have other options there as well?,1998,1995,,,post by ruth januari 18 1998 004155 i 47 year old femal chronic hypertens rightsid chf angina becaus hypertens i begun weight reduct program lost 35 lbs onli month ago i diagnos chf last week i decompens requir hospit stay my cardiologist suggest either heart cath nuclear stress test determin caus angina thus perhap give us reason chf well unfortun i weigh 380 lbs xray tabl support weight high so cardiologist decid tri regul symptom medic for sever reason i process look new cardiologist area want well inform i first see himher are test procedur avail could determin caus angina one mention i echocardiogram show enlarg heart sever ecg show tachycardia rightsid cardiac stiff ani option i discuss andor tri or i stuck speak weight come anoth 80 lbs sowhich might take thank advanc advic by way med angina includ betablock atenolol isosorbid dinatol spell i suffer excruci headach told i live find caus angina is true i option well
766,Atenolol+hypertension,I was just diagnosed with non valvular atrial fibrillation two weeks ago and sent home on amiodarone 200mg/day after I had a chemical conversion with amiodarone. This stuff makes me unable to do anything. I am also taking xarelto 20mg a day. Before this event I was having issues with palpitations and was diagnosed with hypertension in Feb 2012 and have been having trouble with getting the right medication. I am on Norvasc 5mg and 12.5mg hctz both one a day for the hypertension. My issue is that when I do normal activity like picking up around the house I am winded and cannot work very long. I also still have an issue with feeling like I am going to pass out (had these episodes for 6 months before they diagnosed the htn). I am on short term disability but am concerned because I have to drive to work an hour each way. I feel like my doctors are not addressing my issues and I am wondering if there are any suggestions. I am only 48 years young; my only other issue is my obesity and I am working on losing it.

He will go back I'm the next few months to have the same procedure done again several times. We went to his regular dr appt yesterday to talk about our options in treating hep c again.

768,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Doc; as always thanks for allowing me to ask a question. As a 29 year old symptomatic (chest pain; dizziness; nausea) sufferer of frequent PVC's (10-30\min) with mild hypertension for the most part controlled by 12.5 mg Atenolol daily; but with an apprantly stucuturaly normal heart could you offer an insight into the following; 1) My understanding is in general PVC's that are supressed on exercise do not pose a problem; but PVC's NOT supressed on exercise can? A recent stress test I had; when compared to one taken some 18 months earlier showed that whilst my BPM were taken up to about 170 the PVC's were no longer completely supressed; at one point I was getting 15\min with the only notable symptom being dizziness. Though in the computers words no complex ectopy (At rest I can enter long bouts of bigeminy) 2) A lot of respected websites state that in general 6 or more PVC's\min do require treatment; if so; what is the prognosis for one getting the rate of them that I do (as high as 30\min at worst; average 15\min) Can the irritable focus develop over time ie. like water running over stone over the years if you see what I mean. So that sooner or later; a pathway may be completed which could change the situation. 3) In my case; after recording triggers for my PVC's I have noted the following inflame them; Eating food; any food; and taking fluids (hot; cold or normal) Sudden bouts of activity ie. becoming mobile from being at rest. Coughing Sneezing Or no reason in particular; away they go Eating food is particularly agitating; because I eat le,2004,2004,,,hello doc alway thank allow ask question as 29 year old symptomat chest pain dizzi nausea suffer frequent pvcs 1030min mild hypertens part control 125 mg atenolol daili apprant stucuturali normal heart could offer insight follow 1 my understand general pvcs supress exercis pose problem pvcs not supress exercis a recent stress test i compar one taken 18 month earlier show whilst bpm taken 170 pvcs longer complet supress one point i get 15min notabl symptom dizzi though comput word complex ectopi at rest i enter long bout bigemini 2 a lot respect websit state general 6 pvcsmin requir treatment prognosi one get rate i high 30min worst averag 15min can irrit focus develop time ie like water run stone year see i mean so sooner later pathway may complet could chang situat 3 in case record trigger pvcs i note follow inflam eat food food take fluid hot cold normal sudden bout activ ie becom mobil rest cough sneez or reason particular away go eat food particular agit i eat le

770,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this ""defect"" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were ""shuddering""); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a ""click""? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid ""leaking"" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in ""slower motion"". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest ""rushes"" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these ""weird"" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol.

772,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello. Over the course of a year; I begin have strange tingling sensations in my left arm. Eventually they traveled to my hand; and I would feel pricks in my fingers or see the fleshy part twitch. Later same symptoms traveled to left foot;followed by ankle and heel pain. I have had left sided headaches; primarily in the temple area. The headaches were constant; throbbing; or would feel like a crawling sensation. My current headache has lasted about five weeks. Occassionally; there is twitching around the eyes; and a tingling sensation in the face; particularly near the lips. Also ear pain;tenderness behind ear and jaw. Add to these symptoms general twitches throughout the body; a very stiff feeling left hand and sore left arm;leg pain; achy knees; back pain -upper and lower; shoulder and neck pain; often both sides-more pronounced on the left. I have had a nerve conduction test on the left arm; an MRI of the cervical spine; and a brain MRI; plus consults with a orthopedic Dr (physiatrist?); and a neurologist. All negative results. The neuro Dr. said he saw what might be a small bone spur on the MRI.

773,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm female; 45 yrs. old with hypertension (treated with 100mg atenolol daily); hashimoto's (synthroid 200mcg); and rheumatoid arthritis. After a sudden loss of sensation in my left armpit which extended to about my elbow; some pretty severe chest pains and a bad headache; I was hospitalized for a few days to run several tests including; brain MRI;ultrasound of neck and chest;stress test; nuclear scan on my chest as well as lots of bloodwork. The conclusion....absolutely nothing. I was given 2 doses of morphine to relieve the chest pain after nitro failed to help and after that the pain subsided.However;4 days later my armpit is still numb.Very numb.In the last 3 months I've noticed some changes in vision(blurred);occasional slurred speech and a clogged feeling in my head and ears. It's actually difficult to hear.And 1 other thing; once in a while my nose will drip what looks like water; I'm not at all congested or coughing nor have I had a cold. I'm most concerned with the numbness.The neurologist on call casually mentioned that I might follow up with him later but he didn't seem concerned.Any thoughts?,2006,2006,,,im femal 45 yrs old hypertens treat 100mg atenolol daili hashimoto synthroid 200mcg rheumatoid arthriti after sudden loss sensat left armpit extend elbow pretti sever chest pain bad headach i hospit day run sever test includ brain mriultrasound neck cheststress test nuclear scan chest well lot bloodwork the conclusionabsolut noth i given 2 dose morphin reliev chest pain nitro fail help pain subsidedhowever4 day later armpit still numbveri numbin last 3 month ive notic chang visionblurredoccasion slur speech clog feel head ear it actual difficult hearand 1 thing nose drip look like water im congest cough i cold im concern numbnessth neurologist call casual mention i might follow later didnt seem concernedani thought
774,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear CHC Physicians; Background: Male - Age 66. MI in 1997 resulting in an angioplasty(without a stent) in my LAD. Yearly thallium stress tests have been normal and similar. Presently jogging 30 minutes per day. Total Cholesterol 118; HDL 55; LDL 52; Triglycerides 53. Daily medications to maintain a blood pressure of 125/72 consisted of the following since the MI ten years ago: Altace(10mg) twice a day); Atenolol(50mg); Hydrochlorothiazide(25mg); Imdur(30mg); Lipitor(20mg); and Aspirin(81mg). Recently my systolic blood pressure started to elevate to 150 and my doctor has now added Norvasc(5mg) per day to bring my systolic back into the 125 - 135 range. It was explained that this could be due to the onset of Isolated Systolic Hypertension(ISH). My diastolic blood pressure has been relatively normal between 70 - 75. The only troublesome oddity now is that after a carbohydrate meal(pasta; etc.) and two glasses of wine my blood pressure will fall to approximately 80/50 and then rise to its normal level which may be due to a postpradnial effect. However; I do not have any low blood pressure symptoms(dizziness; lightheadedness; etc.). Is this too low a blood pressure without symptoms? Should I consider halving my daily Norvasc to 2 1/2 mg per day? Any other comments would be welcome. I do have a yearly physical and my complete blood count has always been normal as has the rest of the physical. My present goal is to maintain good blood pressure control.

775,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doc; I have a question about pvc`s. My question is if pvc`s subside;do you still have them occuring.Mine are starting to subside and I was wondering if you still have them even if you don`t feel them. Would they show up on a holter moniter if you didnot feel them occuring? These are new to me; I`ve only had them for a month. They started when I started taking Propranolol 20mg/day for cardilogist suggested high bp[140/90;135/85]. I started to get side effects to the drug so he lowered it. I went to a bp clinic and suggested that I should`nt be on it.[ Suggest lowering salt and weight first to see if that help. Also lower anxiety that I was experiecing from the side effects. I toke the lowered dosage for 13 days when all of a sudden I stared to experiece pvc`s. I went to the cardio and he raised me back up to 20mg/day and after 2 wk they are subsiding to the point that I can barely feel them. I am wondering that if I stop feeling them ; are they still occuring. Can they reoccur? If the bp clinic wants me to stop taking the meds for bp; will the pvc`s reoccur? How much control does 20mg/day have anyway. I am at a total loss as to what to do! I see the blood pressure clinic on Jan. 5 to see what my pressure will be. If they are gone by then do I stop taking the meds for blood pressure or do I continue to take meds for control? of pvc`s if they are gone. Any help in this matter would greatly be apppreciated.

776,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my questions. My questions are . My average heartrate during the morning and afternoon are between 85 to 105 bpm. It usually rises right after eating. From around 5 pm My average heartrate is around 80 bpm and at night it averages between 54 and 62 bpm. I take Cozaar 50mg daily for borderline hypertension; which I would say contolls my B/P quite well . Again my B/P during the day averages between 125/85 to 120/80; but at night my B/P averages around 110/70. I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis; which is usually worse in the morning; Do you think this disease might actually contribute to the these fluctuations in heartrate and B/P. I had an Echo done two and a half years; which showed marginal concentric LVH; which the doctor said was probably due to mild hypertenion; measurements on diastole measured between 10mm to 12mm; I understand the normal range is 8mm to 11mm; Would you suggest another echo at this time or do you think it can wait a bit longer> I had an ECG in Feb this year which was normal. I do suffer from PVCs ; but since I stopped taking atenolol; the PVC are few and far between thank goodness. It slowed my heartrate but aggravated the PVCs. Do you think that beta blockers can aggravate PVCs in some persons; while helping others? And last but not least; Are you aware of data or studies that show or suggest that people who usually complain of PVC ; Pacs and palpitaions are usually shown to actually have stronger and healthier hearts than average? Thanks in Advance; hank.,2001,2003,,,thank take question my question my averag heartrat morn afternoon 85 105 bpm it usual rise right eat from around 5 pm my averag heartrat around 80 bpm night averag 54 62 bpm i take cozaar 50mg daili borderlin hypertens i would say contol bp quit well again bp day averag 12585 12080 night bp averag around 11070 i suffer ankylos spondyl usual wors morn do think diseas might actual contribut fluctuat heartrat bp i echo done two half year show margin concentr lvh doctor said probabl due mild hypertenion measur diastol measur 10mm 12mm i understand normal rang 8mm 11mm would suggest anoth echo time think wait bit longer i ecg feb year normal i suffer pvcs sinc i stop take atenolol pvc far thank good it slow heartrat aggrav pvcs do think beta blocker aggrav pvcs person help other and last least are awar data studi show suggest peopl usual complain pvc pac palpitaion usual shown actual stronger healthier heart averag thank advanc hank
777,Atenolol+hypertension,"Howdy. Glad I found this site. Description: 41 yr old male. Non-smoker; controlled hypertension; about 40 lbs overweight; large frame man; 6'3"" 275 lbs. I started having a-fib 4 yrs ago; age 37. Did all the test and heart seems normal except a slightly enlarged atrium; maybe due to undiagnosed HBP on my part. Went thru all the meds with no help. Had my first ablation in Austin in Jan. 2002. Went back into a-fib within 2 weeks. Doctor said give it 3 months. Same pattern developed where it would stay in for a week or two and then return to sinus for a week or two. Finally in May of 2003 I went into a-fib 24/7 and been in since. The EP says another ablation has about a 50/50 chance of working. Questions. 1). Should I try another ablation first? 2). With the failed ablation and the enlarged atrium should I just go ahead and put in the pacemaker. The EP says it has the best chance of controlling my life. 3). Does everybody experience consant dizziness and lightheadedness? Is this a symptom of the A-fib or the meds. I am currently on Diltiazm. Lisinopril; Atenolol.

778,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 34 yowf with obesity. 2 years ago suffered a ""panic attack"" but I asked my PCP to exhaust every avenue of my heart because I got very scared. EKG's have all been normal. Bloodwork taken at the ER various times- Normal. Heart monitor showed I had some PVC(?) but those are normal/benign he said. Echocardiogram-I have ?? about- The conclusion is: Normal left venricular function with minor mitral andd tricuspid regurgitation. No other structural heart disease identified. Estimated right heart pressures are borderline elevated. Measurements show IVS 0.7 (nl 3.5-5.6cm); LVD 4.9 (nl 2.5-5.4cm); LVS 1.9 (nl .6-1.1cm); LVPW .6 (nl .6-1.1cm); Fractional Shortening 60.9 (nl 21-57%); LA 3.9 (nl 1.6-4.0cm) then out from that is 2D 4.5 x 3.1.; AO 3.0 (nl 2.0-3.7cm); AVE 1.9 (nl 1.5cm) RV 2.5. Under interpreation everything said normal other than what mentioned in Conclusion except ""mild age changes to aortic and mitral valve""; okay now my ?? are: What do the measurements mean; especially the ones that seem out of normal range? Would being extremely nervous/scared during ECHO effect results? What are PVC's; why do I feel them? Sometimes if I feel my pulse in my neck it's as if I feel a slight ""delay"" is that nl?

780,Atenolol+hypertension,I'am a 46 yo male who has had pvcs since age 29. family history of heart disease on maternal side. I'am in good condition and active.I've had elevated BP for years .Have been on atenlol 25mg twice daily for 15 years which manages bp well avg reading 118/65. The atenonlol controlled pvcs for years but when I hit around 40 they came on with a vengence .I've had the usual battery of holters; event monitors; regular and nuclear stress tests and echo's all OK. After reaching the point of intolerance3 years ago I decided to try flecainide 50mg twice daily which stopped the Pvcs cold. At same time I reduced atenolol to 25mg and added a low dose of ACE inhibitor to control BP. Then at my physical last year Blood tests showed low white cell count . Cardio took me off the flecainide and Ace and put my Atenlol back to 50 mg. After three months white cell count back to normal but those cursed pvcs have come back to pre flecainide levels of probably several thousand per day. Cardio mentioned sotolol but I am haesitant and have been living with them and have not tryed the sotolol. I am concerned that these meds are worse than the disease but if I must go back on one is flecanide or sotolol better or is it a toss up? I feel as did my cardio that the ACe was the cause of the white cell depression.Should I get any other tests given my history?The low heart rate from the beta blocker seems to spur the pvcs is it feasible I wean off the beta and try another med for BP control? Are these runs of pvc's a reason alone to treat them or should I live with it? your opinion of my situation? than,2004,2004,,,iam 46 yo male pvcs sinc age 29 famili histori heart diseas matern side iam good condit activ elev bp year have atenlol 25mg twice daili 15 year manag bp well avg read 11865 the atenonlol control pvcs year i hit around 40 came vengenc ive usual batteri holter event monitor regular nuclear stress test echo ok after reach point intolerance3 year ago i decid tri flecainid 50mg twice daili stop pvcs cold at time i reduc atenolol 25mg ad low dose ace inhibitor control bp then physic last year blood test show low white cell count cardio took flecainid ace put atenlol back 50 mg after three month white cell count back normal curs pvcs come back pre flecainid level probabl sever thousand per day cardio mention sotolol i haesit live tri sotolol i concern med wors diseas i must go back one flecanid sotolol better toss i feel cardio ace caus white cell depressionshould i get test given historyth low heart rate beta blocker seem spur pvcs feasibl i wean beta tri anoth med bp control are run pvcs reason alon treat i live opinion situat

782,Atenolol+hypertension,Concerning Treadmill exercise stress testing: 1) Is it a fairly safe test for a person with no known heart disease; but with risk factors such as hypertension; anxiety; and panic disorder; like myself? 2) If a cardiac event were to occur; would it occur at peak exercise; or would it happen during the recovery phase? 3) My last test was in 2001; at age 41....test was negative; and I worked up to 10.1 METS on the Bruce protocol.....I understand that stress tests can determine blockages of 70 % and higher; but I was told by the tech. that I worked hard enough to determine that there was not even a 50 % blockage.....Does that sound correct? 4) I am on Toprol XL 25 mgs a day.....will I be instructed to stop it before testing?

783,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi all; I have a question I hope someone qualified can help with. 31 years ago (at age 6); I started taking Inderal prescribed while suffering from congestive heart failure related to kidney damage (caused by a birth defect that was previously fixed; but obviously the damage remained). The inderal was prescribed as a result of high blood pressure. 17 years ago; I had a kidney transplant. There was no evidence of high blood pressure post transplant. But since I appeared to tolerate the inderal; the doctors decided there was no reason to discontinue it. 7 years ago; after complaining of fatigue and dizziness; a new doctor (I'm in an HMO...I rarely see anyone twice) said we should discontinue the Inderal (then 60mg 2x/day). He said there would be no problem going Cold Turkey. 7 days later; I ended up on the side of the road shaking violently; heart beating ""out of my chest""; fainting and generally thinking I was having a stroke or heart attack. I had never experienced anything so frightening. A trip to the emergency room resulted in the ER doc saying; ""oh; you had a panic attack. Go home; you're fine."" My transplant docs suggested I go back on Inderal; saying it could help the anxiety (no suggestion of weaning; or that going cold turkey might have CAUSED the anxiety etc.). I promptly complied. After reading too much about anxiety off the Internet (believing I had a panic disorder since thats what the ER doc suggested); I then started giving myself panic attacks over dumb stuff. Although the Inderal ""took the edge off""; it was a few years before I finally realized my only real issue was minor sinusitis that can cause headaches/dizziness when driving up mountains or when low pressure systems. I still get minor panicky feelings at times (mostly get clausterphobic a little); but have learned how to ignore then. NOW; I'm trying to get preggers; and the perinatologist wants me off the Inderal for a few reasons. One; she wants to know if I even have hypertension anymore (since we've seen no sign of it since the transplant). Two; at her office today my heart rate was 42 BPM. She had me do some jumping jacks; and then dryly said ""gee; that got you to 45 bpm; nice try."" She thinks it might be the Inderal (go figure; after 31 years!). BTW; these days I'm on 40mg once per day (I exercise in the afternoons; so I skip the morning dose with doc approval in the hope of getting at least a little cardio benefit). My heart rate is usually very low; in the 50s or 60s. After skipping a dose I can get it to 120 running on a treadmill. I occasionally have palpitations; and I believe irregular/skipped heartbeats that have never been caught on an EKG; but generally can be ""cured"" with a good cough. I have had a couple of episodes where for no discernable reason the treadmill will claim my heart rate is 178 when I'm not even moving. And a couple more times where I was kicking butt and the heart rate didn't get about 55. These may or may not have been malfunctions of the equipment; but generally those days I felt something was off. Doctors have refused the ""holter"" device because they say at my age and with my EKG (always normal); they don't see the risk (the only other risk factor I have is that I'm about 40lbs overweight). OKAY; thanks for reading thus far. Here's my question: The doc wants me to start by going down to 20mg 2x/day for a few weeks. Given all of the above; is this pretty safe? What should I look out for? If the anxiety kicks back up; should I just ride it out? I tried asking the doc all this; and she said not to worry so much. Which is great advice; but contrary to my personality. PLUS; since I've been on this darn drug since I was a kid; I don't even know what ""normal"" is. But I want it. It's gotta be better than being a fat zombie who is always cold. :-) Advice appreciated; since there's a lot of wild info on the Net on this topic (IE ""stop inderal and you'll have a heart attack!"" etc. Talk about giving a gal something to worry about!)",2008,2008,,,hi i question i hope someon qualifi help 31 year ago age 6 i start take inder prescrib suffer congest heart failur relat kidney damag caus birth defect previous fix obvious damag remain the inder prescrib result high blood pressur 17 year ago i kidney transplant there evid high blood pressur post transplant but sinc i appear toler inder doctor decid reason discontinu 7 year ago complain fatigu dizzi new doctor im hmoi rare see anyon twice said discontinu inder 60mg 2xday he said would problem go cold turkey 7 day later i end side road shake violent heart beat chest faint general think i stroke heart attack i never experienc anyth frighten a trip emerg room result er doc say oh panic attack go home your fine my transplant doc suggest i go back inder say could help anxieti suggest wean go cold turkey might caus anxieti etc i prompt compli after read much anxieti internet believ i panic disord sinc that er doc suggest i start give panic attack dumb stuff although inder took edg year i final realiz real issu minor sinus caus headachesdizzi drive mountain low pressur system i still get minor panicki feel time most get clausterphob littl learn ignor now im tri get pregger perinatologist want inder reason one want know i even hypertens anymor sinc weve seen sign sinc transplant two offic today heart rate 42 bpm she jump jack dryli said gee got 45 bpm nice tri she think might inder go figur 31 year btw day im 40mg per day i exercis afternoon i skip morn dose doc approv hope get least littl cardio benefit my heart rate usual low 50s 60s after skip dose i get 120 run treadmil i occasion palpit i believ irregularskip heartbeat never caught ekg general cure good cough i coupl episod discern reason treadmil claim heart rate 178 im even move and coupl time i kick butt heart rate didnt get 55 these may may malfunct equip general day i felt someth doctor refus holter devic say age ekg alway normal dont see risk risk factor i im 40lbs overweight okay thank read thus far here question the doc want start go 20mg 2xday week given pretti safe what i look if anxieti kick back i ride i tri ask doc said worri much which great advic contrari person plus sinc ive darn drug sinc i kid i dont even know normal but i want it got ta better fat zombi alway cold advic appreci sinc there lot wild info net topic ie stop inder youll heart attack etc talk give gal someth worri
784,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 36 yr old male. Work out 4 days a week. I got an MRA last week for some bad headaches I'd had over the weekend (turned out to be migraine). As an incidental finding on the MRA; my PCP called and said I had a 3 mm aneurysm on the anterior communicating artery. He was very dismissive of this and said this is a very tiny one; asymptomatic and likely has been with me most of my life. He said he wanted to recheck it periodically and that I should not worry. Easier said than done. I've been a wreck; worrying that I have a ticking bomb in my head and everytime I take a jog or play some indoor soccer I'm thinking its either going to grow or possibly rupture. I've stopped weightlifting (I did moderate not very heavy weights) and I've given up my weekly cigar. I don't drink and I take atenolol for borderline hypertension. I've had nobody in my family going back several generations ever die of stroke or have an aneurys rupture. My doc senses my anxiety over this and has told me to see a neurosurgeon here in Cincinnati to have an expert evaluate it. He still absolutely thinks surgery is not adivsed at this time and that periodic observation is the wisest choice. I'm quite worried that a neuro""surgeon"" is going to want to operate. My other concern is that watching and waiting may require me to stop all cardio exercise and sport which is my main stress relief and joy in life.

It starts about 2-5 mins after during smoking or just after smoking; the first time it was so serious i had to get out of the car and stand up forcing myself to breath to stay alive; later on i noticed that the feeling seems to be relieved by alcohol; if i take some alcohol the loss of respiratory dirve seems to go away or rather if i am drinking and smoking i don't notice any loss of respiratory drive; another intriguing thing is that i don't always have this feeling when i smoke; it just comes up sometime and other times it doessn't; i can have it when i smoke now; but hours later i may try smoking and it doesn't happen; i'm surprised; anyway i've decided to quit since i can't pinpoint the exact cause or solution to the problem; will appreciate it if someone can help me though so i can go on enjoying my smokes again,2009,2010,34.0,Male,34 african amerian histori hypertensionhypertens heart dx current take amlodipin captopril atenolol moduret control bp this new develop week notic difficulti breath rather sort loss urg breath loss respiratori drive kind breath automat anymor forc drag air lung it start 25 min smoke smoke first time serious get car stand forc breath stay aliv later notic feel seem reliev alcohol take alcohol loss respiratori dirv seem go away rather drink smoke dont notic loss respiratori drive anoth intrigu thing dont alway feel smoke come sometim time doessnt smoke hour later may tri smoke doesnt happen im surpris anyway ive decid quit sinc cant pinpoint exact caus solut problem appreci someon help though go enjoy smoke

790,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia. Lately; I've been experiencing severe nausea; dizziness; fatigue; weakness; and headaches whenever I exercise; which is a mixture of walking and weight training. Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10""); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem? Or am I just turning into a medical basket case?

791,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi; all - I am currently on 2 mg. diazapam (valium) and 5 mg. celexa (half a 10 mg. pill). I just started the celexa about 3 weeks ago; and have been on an even lower dose (working up frm 1/4 to half to 3/4 to 2 mg last month - my own way - I was prescribed the 2 mg.). Prior to the valium; I was on Ativan for about 2 months. My understanding from my psychiatrist is that the 'plan' is up the celexa (although I don't know how far - I have dysthymia and ocd; so I hear...) and at some point come off the valium. I also have hypertension; so take atenolol and lisinopril and a baby asprin each day. I'm 59 years old. Anyway; I see my primary care doc once a month - he is a cool old-school guy; who used to see me primarily for 'reassurance' for various anxiety / ocd issues until he decided I needed a psychiatrist to give me meds. He sent me to a colleague; who has me on these meds. Those close to me - my husband; therapist and a friend who is a former RN and who herself takes lexapro; all say I am doing 'much better' than I was. When I started posting here; I could barely eat solid food - mashed potatoes were difficult. Now; I have made some real improvement (hamburger; cut up; soft veg; and so on); although I'm not yet where I need to be (can't eat chicken; and so on.). When I saw my primary care guy yesterday; I saw I'd gained 5 lbs. OMG! I want to blame the meds but the reality is as I can eat stuff; I grab all the things that are bad for me; like donuts; cakes; chips and mex food. In any event; 5 lbs in one month seems high. My BP was also up but the doc wasn't concerned so much. He thought I might ask the psych to 'cut back' on the valium; as I complain of being 'lazy' and 'tired.' I will have been on some sort of valium in any case since February; albeit at a low dose. He also suggested asking to cut back on the celexa - to 2 mg. Huh? My psych said I wouldn't feel anything on 5 mg. I do feel somewhat tired; but I really doubt she's going to go down to 2 mg. I think my primary care doc's focus was to get me to a point where I could eat again. The psych seems to be looking at things differently - telling me I might have to take meds for my ocd 'for the rest of my life.' I am just starting the process of trying to get ON SSRI's; not off them. Aside from some nausea and tiredness / apathy; no big deal on the side effects. But I am confused. Do I try to get OFF this stuff now? If I do; will I still be able to eat? Will folks think I'm 'better?' I'm inclined to think my success is from the meds; and that if I go off; it won't be long before I'm back to square 1. I don't want to be; but why would my primary care suggest I cut back on such low doses? I serously doubt my psych would consider lowering anything at this point; I""m almost afraid to ask. I hate to bring up that my primary care doc suggested it; as they are colleagues at the same clinic - and well; in a showdown; you know who gets thrown under the bus - and it aint either of them. One or the other will say I didn't understand or whatall; just to save face... at least that's how that stuff usuall works. Ok; any one have any ideas on what i can do here? How can I discuss this w/ my psych diplomatically? She's a bit of a diva; but she seems to be very smart and I like her. I like my primary care doc too; though; and that's the problem. They both seem to have divergent opinions. As I see my psych next week; I need input asap - thanks.

793,Atenolol+hypertension,Has anyone who suffers from Hypothyroidism have any problems with their blood pressure being too low? I have read a lot of sites that have covered hypothyroidism and HIGH blood pressure. But I do not now nor have I ever had High Blood pressure. On an average I run around 90/70 but there are times when I can feel my blood pressure dropping and when I do it is always with the following symptoms: I just want to sleep; no matter how much work there is still to be done; and I get a little foggy in my brain. Over time I learned to test my blood pressure when I started to feel that way. Two weeks ago I was feeling that way and tested it at the local grocery store and I was 97/58 with a normal pulse rate. I have asked Dr's repeatedly how low is to low and get told nothing usually. Out of sheer desperation I asked the local pharmacist for suggestions on what to do when I felt that way. The answer was shockingly simple and yet has at least partially helped me out. That answer was get some Gatorade and drink it. She said it was the salt and electrolytes that I was needing. It's not a cure but it does seem to help me in any case. I just want to know am I the only one out there that has LOW Blood pressure with this? thanks!,2011,2011,33.0,Female,has anyon suffer hypothyroid problem blood pressur low i read lot site cover hypothyroid high blood pressur but i i ever high blood pressur on averag i run around 9070 time i feel blood pressur drop i alway follow symptom i want sleep matter much work still done i get littl foggi brain over time i learn test blood pressur i start feel way two week ago i feel way test local groceri store i 9758 normal puls rate i ask drs repeat low low get told noth usual out sheer desper i ask local pharmacist suggest i felt way the answer shock simpl yet least partial help that answer get gatorad drink she said salt electrolyt i need it cure seem help case i want know i one low blood pressur thank
794,Atenolol+hypertension,I am having palpitations occasionally that feel so very forceful. They cause me to stop what I am doing immediately and I obsess about them for hours afterword. I have a history of anxiety and panic and depression. I am currently taking lamictal and lexapro with atenolol for high blood pressure and anxiety reduction. I have been diagnosed with hypertension and anxiety and depression. I had a full cardiac work up with chemical stress test; echocardiogram; bloodwork; nuclear medicine heart exam; and my cardiologist said I was fine. This work up was around 2 years ago. The only thing is that my C-reactive protein is elevated. I believe it is in the 8 range when anything >3 is considered high. I do not remember the unit of measurement with that. My cholesterol is slightly elevated from what I hear but it is still within normal limits and as such no medication has been prescribed. I have GERD and I am taking prilosec but this was diagnosed only recently and the palpitations existed prior to that problem. I am a 28 year old morbidly obese male. I am in the process of continuing to lose weight as I am 5'11 and 345 pounds. Even though they say I am ok whenever I have those terrible palpitations I am just so fearful that the end is near. What can I do? Did they miss something; or am I just obsessing? How do I know the difference? Is it time for another workup?

796,Atenolol+hypertension,For those of you who have been experiencing and/or suffering with these pin-pricking and burning sensations over the years like me; I was just diagnosed with lupus in December 2010! It was learned via my remarkable dermatologist who noticed that I was getting a butterfly rash on my face that prompted him to test me for this disease. This type of rash is commonly found on people with lupus. Please ask your physician's to check your ANA levels; to confirm if your pin-pricking and burning sensations are in relation to lupus like mines!! My symptoms had ceased almost immediately after being removed from the medication; but I had already developed this disease. PLEASE; don't delay getting this blood test done; because if you have lupus and it remains untreated-- it can affect your organs (heart; kidneys; brain) which can become severe; and even deadly!! Also; my lupus was drug-induced by a long-term seizure medication that I was prescribed for a number of years. There are tons of medications; to include hypertension meds like (Atenolol); diuretics (HTCZ); and anti-inflammatories (Naproxen) that can induce lupus as well! Check out your meds too! Good luck to each of you; because these symptoms are truly annoying; and can affect the quality of ones life tremendously!!!,2011,2011,,,for experienc andor suffer pinprick burn sensat year like i diagnos lupus decemb 2010 it learn via remark dermatologist notic i get butterfli rash face prompt test diseas this type rash common found peopl lupus pleas ask physician check ana level confirm pinprick burn sensat relat lupus like mine my symptom ceas almost immedi remov medic i alreadi develop diseas pleas dont delay get blood test done lupus remain untreat affect organ heart kidney brain becom sever even dead also lupus druginduc longterm seizur medic i prescrib number year there ton medic includ hypertens med like atenolol diuret htcz antiinflammatori naproxen induc lupus well check med good luck symptom truli annoy affect qualiti one life tremend
797,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 32 yr female/ 5'3"" 200 lbs/ overweight /non-smoker/ hypothyroidism/ take 90 Armour / mild hypertension/ 50 atenolol About six weeks ago; I was shoveling snow and felt a tiny 5 second stabbing pain in the upper left center of my chest. then i resumed shoveling and was fine. The next several days my shoulder and left arm were very sore and almost like an icy/ hot feeling all over that arm. I thought I had pulled my shoulder blade or something. I was seen by a chiropractor. He took my BP; it was normal. Took my pulse; it was normal. He adjusted me. That pain lessened after a couple of days. However; I continued to feel some slight chest; shoulder; back and arm pain. I experience some mild stabbing/ burning in my left arm pit and shoulder blade- almost like it wraps around my left breast and shoulder. Also; I have been experiencing more ""wet"" belching than normal for the last month; on and off since this occurred. I did NOT experience dizziness or lightheadedness. I have not really been short of breath; except when I start to be anxious and panic about it. Sometimes I feel fine; and other times; I feel this pain. It is aggravating. It is the worst at night. I was supposed to have a surgery; so after about a month of on and off pain; I had blood work and a pre-op EKG. It came back abnormal. It scared the dickens out of me; and i panicked in the middle of the night (the same day i recieved the results) and ended up going to the ER. The ER doc rain blook work and looked at my chest xray and did two more EKGs; with similar abnormal results-- basically all saying i had possible av block; abnormal twaves; and possible enlargment of right and left atriums. The ER doc said I had not had a heart attack and I was fine; just to follow up with a stress test to get clearance for my surgery. I was referred for a nuclear stress test. My baseline EKG at the stress test said ""cannot rule out anterior infarct"".... but the imaging came back normal. In fact; the stress test went well; reaching heart rate of 160 in 11 minutes. The cardiologist said the nuclear stress test came back normal with ""excellent functionality and no cause for alarm"". The cardiologist said that my heart was fine and everything looked good and the EKG readings often come back as ""false positives"" on young women so I shouldn't worry. After an exam; he said my heart ""sounded"" good. My blood panel was good. My chest xray was good. He said though he can't promise I will never have a heart attack that today my ""ticker's just fine"". No reason for the chest pain was explained or even mentioned by the cardiologist. He only said to exercise more often as a preventative because of my family history (dad had two heart attacks at 50; but he was a very heavy smoker). I have been exercising every day for the last week; running on the treadmill for over a mile and ballroom dancing three times per week for and hour. I do not experience chest pains during exercise- actually it generally feels a little better during exercise. I'm am still nervous because I know not all nuclear stress tests are 100% accurate. Should I ask for more tests? The cardiologist indicated he did not even need to see me for any type of follow up....

798,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am writing to try to get some information on what might be happening to my partner who experiences significant mood swings/behavioral changes at times. He refuses to go to the doctor so I am wondering if someone here can help me. First some information on his background and condition: Caucasian Male 39 yrs old. 30 Lbs overweight Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Tachycardia Former methamphetamine user (used for many years; but has been clean for 10+ yrs.) Binge drinker (1 or 2 times a week) Current medications: Lisinopril (Blood Pressure) Atenolol (Heart Rate) Valium (for anxiety) Insulin injections (Humulin R; N) Basically; his behavior can go from 'normal' (calm; not agitated; clear-headed; etc.) to what I am calling ""Altered"" in a matter of minutes. During these episodes his behavior will deteriorate where he will gradually start acting like he is intoxicated; even though he has not been drinking. It will begin with slight mood changes and speech changes (such as mild slurring; searching for the correct word; etc.). General mood will be happy and sometimes giddy; unless he becomes agitated by something; which tends to happen very easily. If he becomes agitated or angry then his mood will further decline to belligerent or even violent behavior. He will say hurtful things intentionally and become verbally abusive. This negative mood shift does not always happen. In either case; it seems the only way for him to return to 'normal' is to sleep for 6+ hours. It seems like mentally stressful situations may bring this on; although I have also seen it happen after heavy meals. His Diabetes is not well controlled; and he often has high blood sugar spikes.

799,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear doctor; One of the major troubling symptoms I have been having for the last few years has been breathing difficulties. I am always gasping for breath or feel like I am suffocating. I also have associated jaw locking and muscle spasms especially from the chest upwards. I was always told that it was just anxiety but none of the treatments for anxiety had worked. In fact the breathing techniques my clinical psycologists teach (I have seen 3 ) make me more suffocated. Had been to neurologist and cardiologists for other issues which have been resolved and even had a brain MRI. Now I had been told by my doctor that I am an asthmatic since I had bronchitis when young. But apparently after doing some tests (spirometry??); he mentioned I did not have asthma symptoms. Because of the muscle spasms I thought it had to be then muscular skeletal. I don't have any coughs; nor wheezing and don't have respiratory infections too often either. I am 47 years old - female. My doctor still gave me atenolol for the anxiety and the white coat effect hypertension but I felt more shortness of breath and in fact my blood pressure was higher when I felt panicked and very short of breath. But the last 2 days I applied almost a kind of breathing similar to pursed lip ; where I feel a kind of back pressure in my throat and I can breathe better; there is less muscle spasms/tightness and my posture even is a bit better and I even slept better. I am not a smoker and it is unlikely I have any lung problems . Can a breathing dysfunction cause COPD symptoms and anxiety and tetany like symptoms? I consulted a sleep specialist over these symptoms. He mentioned I did not have typical apnea symptoms but that my throat was very restricted and my jaw was retracted. I am due for the sleep study in 2 months. Please help with some suggestions how to move forward?

800,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 48 yr old female who has been diagnosed with dextrocardia. As far as I know; I've had this condition all of my life and it hasn't affected me in any way. Recently I've begun to have ""episodes"" that have not been diagnosed at this time. It starts with an ache in the back of my throat and tightening of the chest follows. I feel like I have to take deep breaths to come out of it. The episodes last about a minute and toward the end I have tingling in my hands. I tried not to take deep breaths one time and the back of my head felt like it was going to explode. It's very frightening when It happens and just want to understand what is going on. I have been treated for Acid Reflux but the meds didn't do any good. I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure only when exercising. While I'm at rest my blood pressure is normal. Could the blood pressure be a contributing factor to these episodes? My family physician just started me on 25 mg a day of Atenolol for the blood pressure so I'm not sure yet if this will help or not. I'm afraid that I might have an episode and will not be able to come out of it. These episodes happen randomly; I might go a week without incident or I might have 10 episodes in one day. It wakes me up at night while I'm sleeping and I have to sit on the side of the bed until I'm able to breathe normally. Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

The second time was when a friend of mine was putting makeup on me; once again I was standing; but I kept moving my legs so I wouldn't lock them.

802,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 26 year old male. The past several months I've been having an issue when standing up. About 10-20 seconds after standing up my heart rate increases for about 5 seconds before settling down. During those 5 seconds I also hear blood rushing through my head pretty loudly and it feels like it is uncomfortable to stay upright. After a few seconds it goes away and I am totally fine. This sensation is much worse at night and almost unnoticeable during the morning.. Upon taking my blood pressure; the systolic pressure seems to go up somewhat (~10 mmHG). That too settles down once it passes; though it may just be flukes in readings..I am unsure. I have been taking atenolol 25mg for a few years now; but I've cut the pill in half and have been on that for close to 6 weeks now. No significant rise in BP has been documented as a result. I have read it could be POTS; orthostatic hypertension or other arrhythmia; and I've read it could be a valve leak; But I don't think so as it is so quick to pass. I have pretty crippling anxiety; and over the past couple weeks I randomly become anxious about my heart. (I had an episode close to 5 years ago where I went to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack; when it was just an anxiety attack). I had a stress test; echocardiogram and I even wore a heart monitor. Aside from being diagnosed with PVCs; everything came back fine. I had these tests done because my father had a heart attack when he was 25 and triple bypass in his early 30s; so it needed to be ruled out. I'm thinking a lot of it is my anxiety; but not all of it. The increase in heart rate was happening before my anxiety was triggered and I didn't think much of it. I am a full time student; currently unemployed and living off of student loans. So if I wanted to get these tests done again I would be paying out of pocket. Researching the cost of these tests show that I won't be able to afford even one. I'm afraid and worried and it has been affecting my daily life for the past two weeks. Any insight will help.,2015,2015,,Male,hi im 26 year old male the past sever month ive issu stand about 1020 second stand heart rate increas 5 second settl dure 5 second i also hear blood rush head pretti loud feel like uncomfort stay upright after second goe away i total fine this sensat much wors night almost unnotic morn upon take blood pressur systol pressur seem go somewhat 10 mmhg that settl pass though may fluke readingsi unsur i take atenolol 25mg year ive cut pill half close 6 week no signific rise bp document result i read could pot orthostat hypertens arrhythmia ive read could valv leak but i dont think quick pass i pretti crippl anxieti past coupl week i random becom anxious heart i episod close 5 year ago i went er i thought i heart attack anxieti attack i stress test echocardiogram i even wore heart monitor asid diagnos pvcs everyth came back fine i test done father heart attack 25 tripl bypass earli 30s need rule im think lot anxieti the increas heart rate happen anxieti trigger i didnt think much i full time student current unemploy live student loan so i want get test done i would pay pocket research cost test show i wont abl afford even one im afraid worri affect daili life past two week ani insight help
803,Atenolol+hypertension,I have two aneurysms (ascending aortic; and pulmonary) that are under the watchful care of a cardiologist. Recently I have begun to have some almost daily sharp headaches; as the result of orgasm. Does having an aneurysm or two in one location of the body indicate that you are prone to them; and should I see a doctor about the headaches I'm having? They are pretty bad when they kick up; and have had the same kind of headache without additional 'inducement'. I had unchecked hypertension for many years; possibly my entire life up until the first detection of the aortic aneurysm at which time I was put on atenolol. I've seen some references to one being prone to them; and thus they can form anywhere; and my concern is that I may have a a cerebral aneurysm and not know it; outside of the severe headaches I mentioned. What are your thoughts?

810,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on April 20; 1998 at 13:31:17: In Reply to: High Blood Pressure posted by Vila Hall Sr. on April 19; 1998 at 23:06:39: I have been diagnosed as having high blood pressure; but it is only high when I am at the doctors office. I have told two doctors that it is never high any other time. They insist it is and have proscribed fosinopril and atenolol; alsoterazosin which I had to quit taking because of some side effects. I am 77 years old and in the best of health except for arthritis. Am never sick; not even a headache. Can work hard without getting fatigued and am a little overweight. My blood pressure away from the doctors office is usually around 140/70; but at the office is 170/80. My question is; do I have high blood pressure And must I have to take this medicine? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Vila: High blood pressure is a leading cause of strokes. It can also cause heart attacks; kidney failure; and vision problems. New research suggests that it may contribute to dementia and cognitive loss in the elderly. Even mild degrees of high blood pressure can lead to problems over time. One of the problems with high blood pressure is that it can take years for the damage to become evident. All that time you may have no symptoms. That is why high blood pressure is sometimes called the ""silent killer."" Some people have ""white coat hypertension;"" which means that their blood pressure is normal except when they are in the doctors office. While this is less of a problem than sustained high blood pressure; it is still abnormal. Whether to treat white coat hypertension with medications is a trickier issue. At a minimum; patients with white coat hypertension should be advised to switch to a low salt diet; to start exercising regularly; and to lose weight if obese. These simple measures are sometimes enough. If someone is overweight; sometimes even a few pounds of weight loss can suffice. If the blood pressure remains elevated (even if only in the doctors office); many cardiologists would elect to start medications; especially if the blood pressure is very high.

811,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm taking 10 mg of Propanolol 2 times a day for anxiety related tachycardia. I take that dose since a while now. At first I was doing ok; the Propranolol was able to reduce my heart rate in the 60's but since 1 month I experience very fast heart rate; pounding heart beat; some skip heart beat; I can feel and see my shirt moving while my heart is beating. Also my blood pressure is normal to low...110/65 to 100/55. I experience this all the time now. Is it because the Inderal (propranolol) stop working on me? If it's the case; why I continue to have the hypertensive effect of the Inderal but not the heart rate reduction? I ask my Cardio Doc but he just switch me to the Lopressor and had the same problem with that med either... Someone can explain how it's possible to have a normal to low blood pressure with a pounding heart rate and a fast heart rate?

812,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having ""unexplained"" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always ""pounding;"" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1"" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

I have undergone extensive tests (including thyroids) and they can't find a cause; but it all kicked off after giving birth; I read an archive post on here from a lady called Roberta; she said her daughter had the same symptoms as me even down to the severe weight loss and that it was all after the birth; it stated that she had sinus tachy; with it high bp and that she had become very thin and weak like myself. I read the posting on medhelp.com about a woman who's daughter of the same age as me had it in 1999 but there was not much mention of the condition of hyperbeta blah blah. On wikipedia it is related to post traumatic stress. I have adrenalin racing round me all the time; and am on beta blockers and have been prescribed SSRI's also. I developed a fear of giving birth; then of course; I had to give birth; I was relieved after the birth but there was so much adrenalin whooshing round me that I literally could not sleep at all for three days after the birth; I had; on the first night conditioned myself not to sleep after the birth. After that I started sleeping normally; but of course; was using babycentre forums to chat to other mums who had been supporting me and I supporting them through our pregnancies. Then... one of the Mums got a nasty infection a few weeks after the birth; followed by another. Then I got a tooth infection and had gone from fear of birth; to fear of infections. I then stopped eating - fear of getting more food stuck down the gap where my wisdom tooth has not quite come through properly which has caused 5 infections through the pregnancy and that one after the birth. I tried to eat on the other side but was so nervous that I couldn't swallow properly. I would have literally a mouthful a night. As well as that I then noticed I had got a womb infection like my friends and was ""crapping myself"" about it. I was convinced it was bad; because I had looked up the name of the infection and saw what its complications were; I was ULTIMATELY terrified! It was a nasty one. I was given antibiotics and then took another swab test which said it was all clear. But I was not convinced; I had developed other symptoms and was convinced it had become a secondary infection. I noticed I was getting petechaie; flushing; my blood pressure was going up; and more and more symptoms arose. I was getting severe pain in my pelvic area and was in and out of the doctor's on a daily basis in sheer panic. I then caught a virus that was going round; shortly after I developed a painful rash on my legs; then the rash disappeared but I felt weak and drained. I was still not eating. I had not noticed that I had lost weight by this point. I then noticed my skin had gone very pale and transparent; I could see all my veins; I felt weak; my breathing was weak. Something; to me; was very wrong. I felt like my muscles were wasting. I then caught another virus; a bad one this time; it was sinusitis with a throat thing. I could not breathe properly. I had also been crying a lot with anxiety. One night I laid on the bed coughing and my lungs were literally spasming; forcing breath out; it was terrifiying. I could feel the congestion daily working its way down onto my chest. I had earache and my sinuses were heavy. I could feel this tight band around my middle all day one day. My mouth was full of sores when I had tried to eat. I was in a mess. I literally one night ran down to the doctors in fear and when he checked my bp and heart rate he immediately admitted me because they were both sky high. Only to be told after lots of blood tests and chest x ray that my problem was psychiatric! The heart rate never calmed down; I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia; I then got lots of pvcs and pacs etc... and developed an arrhythmia also. I was referred to the cardiologist who said it was stress but has booked me for an echo. Meanwhile my symptoms got worse; I noticed the weight loss and I eventually weighed myself; I was 8 stone; from 10 and a half stone in 2 months! I had lost all my body fat/muscle mass. I was bony; pale and my veins were popping up all the time. I had gone greyish white in colour; dark circles under my eyes. I was back in and out of the doctor's convinced it was physical; my fingernails went bluish; I developed fungal infections in my toenails and feet; I was in pain all of the time in my joints (my joints even went red). I was tested for everything and tests came back normal each time. (thyroids; blood counts; blood cultures; serum levels; electrolytes; esr; ACE; PTH; glucose; you name it) the only levels that have been out recently are my FSH and LH which are both elevated but that can happen in a normal cycle and I was due my period when I had them done so they have to be repeated. I have since developed neurological symptoms and I am very scared; I have asked for an MRI but have been refused. (I was granted a referral recently by another doctor but my doctor put a stop to it; insisting it is purely psychiatric). I also have suspected ME which doesn't help. So; after babbling on like that (sorry); is there a chance that it actually IS psychiatric? Has my living in constant fear caused this? Is my adrenalin whooshing round all day every day? Before birth; my normal bp was 100/60 the highest it went was 110/60. It has always been like that. Now; on the beta blockers; it's 130/80!

814,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently have been awakening at night with an overwhelming feeling of adrenaline rushing through my body then my heart begins to race. I have seen a cardiologist and was put through an excercise stress echo test. All was fine my heart rate reached 180 bpm and was sinus tach. No blockages were found and test was normal; EKG was also normal. I'am currently wearing a 30 day event monitor and at present the racing heart has been showing up as PAT's with rates up to 176 bpm. My cardiologist said that he would put me on the beta blocker 100mg Toprol XL to help alleviate this. The only problem is that I'am a 35yo female 145lbs no hx of high cholesterol; b/p normally runs 100/60 and at times even lower than this. My resting heart rate is usually 68-72 bpm. I'am an LPN and I'm currently working on getting my RN in school; my brother was recently diagnosed with Lung Cancer and just 3 weeks ago my 52yo sister died suddenly. Not to mention I am a mother of 2 ages 4 and 7. I have explained this to my Cardiologist and he still says that it is the PAT's that are causing my anxiety not my anxiety causing the PAT's. I'm concerned about taking medication that will lower my B/P more than it already is. This is begining to effect my life drastically. I'm waking up at night often as many as 4x with my heart pounding; feeling breathless; and shaking all over. It is starting to effect my daily life to the point that I shake much of the time during the day. I have a constant feeling of anxiety and adrenaline jolts.

815,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 22 year old male and I need some advice. Suddenly on November 14; 2007; My heart rate spiked through the roof while showering; previous to that my heart rate was elevated for an hour or so. For the last year and a half I've had bouts with sporadic tachycardia and palpitations; I noticed it mostly after eating. The more I ate it seemed worse. Anyways getting back to this. When I even move around a bit (even lying down) my heart rate elevates rapidly and when I stand up it goes up to about 160+. I was in the trauma unit of my local hospital a few weeks ago as my heart rate would not go below 120 for about 2 hours. I am on 25mg Atenolol 2x/day right now for a total of 50mg; and it has helped but the symptoms breakthrough after anywhere from 2-8 hours. It varies. I'm also on 20mg of Paxil and have been for about 8 months and 2mg of Lorazepam (Ativan). I have had about a dozen ECG's and echocardiagram a holter monitor and everything is fine on them. I (like an idiot) stopped paxil abruptly about 2-3 months ago because I didn't want to be on it anymore; and I started getting bad palpitations. I went back on it and the palpitations settled down but came back after about a week or so; and then everything has seemed to go downhill after that. Any ideas on what is causing this? Like I said when I wasn't on Atenolol when I would even move a little my heart would go up considerably; and if I tried to stand up and walk around; it went to 160+ beats. I get hypertension with it as well; but feel weak. It is a little better with the Atenolol though. I'm just extremely worried and want to know if this will go away or what. I'm scared out of my mind as when there is no pills to at least help a bit; it completely disables me.,2007,2007,21.0,Male,hi im 22 year old male i need advic sudden novemb 14 2007 my heart rate spike roof shower previous heart rate elev hour for last year half ive bout sporad tachycardia palpit i notic most eat the i ate seem wors anyway get back when i even move around bit even lie heart rate elev rapid i stand goe 160 i trauma unit local hospit week ago heart rate would go 120 2 hour i 25mg atenolol 2xday right total 50mg help symptom breakthrough anywher 28 hour it vari im also 20mg paxil 8 month 2mg lorazepam ativan i dozen ecg echocardiagram holter monitor everyth fine i like idiot stop paxil abrupt 23 month ago i didnt want anymor i start get bad palpit i went back palpit settl came back week everyth seem go downhil ani idea caus like i said i wasnt atenolol i would even move littl heart would go consider i tri stand walk around went 160 beat i get hypertens well feel weak it littl better atenolol though im extrem worri want know go away im scare mind pill least help bit complet disabl
816,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi All; I am a 28 year old male; very active until onset of arrhythmia 2 years ago. I noticed arrhythmia 2 years ago after long nights of drinking; coffee during day and 100 hour work weeks (wall street). My heart would 'double' it's beats for 30 seconds and then go back to normal. I didn't think much of it at the time but then one morning after a heavy drinking session I had a terrible episode where I had a bunch of dropped and coupled beats in chaotic rhythm of no real organization that turned into a very rapid tachycardia (250-300bpm) for 3-5 minutes. Never any pain/dizzyness other than what I would expect from severe mental distress (and I've had a terrible time convincing the non-MD's that it's NOT a panic attack..I have several MD's in my family and I know the difference). After a few more episodes during exercize; I went in and saw a doc that said I'd be fine. I didn't trust him so went for a second opinion to Dr. Anthony Aizer at NYU. He is amazingly diligent; patient and willing to walk you through your issues. They did find some 'likely benign' issues and performed a Cavotricuspid Isthmus ablation to cure the CVNRT (made the pathway singular to cure the circuitous problem that made me go into rapid heart rhythm) and found an area that could be generating spontaneous pulses but since they had me on the table for 9 hours; decided to leave it for another day. Things were pretty good for a while but I never did get back to exercizing as I would often have skipped beats as I came down from 150bpm to 120bpm. No more drinking alcohol. But then last week; after a lot of stress and coffee the previous month; I got a bunch of extra or dropped beats; I'm guessing PVCs (feels like a 'ka-chunk' in my chest) a few times a minute; maybe 100 times per hour. It really distresses me and I immediately jump up; get my shoes on and head for the er. I've been admitted once and have slept in the waiting room 3 times in the past week. Seems the only way I can get to sleep is to take 50mil benzodiazapine and wait until I'm so exhausted that I don't care if my next beat is my last. And this is a circuitous feedback loop: tired at work > poor performance > lose money > get angry > cant relax > have pvc > get tired > tired at work etc... No doubt that there is a psychological element but I know it's also largly physiological. And I've gotten good at calming myself down but even when I'm very relaxed I get them. I have had no (knock on wood) pvc's tonight as Doc Aizer perscribed some Atenolol. I can usually feel when the jump is going to come (I'm only guessing that it's a pvc) and think it definitely has something to do with adrenal uptake. I can feel a certain undescribable 'queezyness' in my chest sometimes for a split second before as if a chemical were injected (and this is from no aparent stimulus) and then get the jumped beat. I can feel the electricity swallowing my heart muscle in a quick gulp. Can anyone put my mind to ease that this is likely nothing serious? Logically; I should not worry. I have one of the best electrophysiologists in the country on my case and he's explored the inside of my heart in finest detail; has done every test; and knows what is most likely wrong. But I had a non-biological uncle who died at 22 of sudden cardiac death and cause was never found (and his father was a top sergeon who made sure of a proper autopsy). I just don't quite understand what makes the beats keep coming and am scared that they will spontaneously stop all together or that they'll go into overdrive or that one pvc will turn into a long strand. It's sort of comical when the er doc says ""you won't need to come back unless you pass out"" and it's that assymetry of outcomes that worries me: either its ok or we'll know it's not because you'll be dead. And this is where it's definitely a mind block for me: it's almost like I have PTSD from the whole experience. Do people die from these skipped beats? I'm sure there are a few unsolved cases but what generally makes structurally healthy people die from arrhythmia other than drugs? Thanks for any advice; opinion or comment.

817,Atenolol+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk profile for an embolic event due to her AF?",2009,2009,,Female,medic histori my mom age 71live singapor histori hypertens she hospit 509 drug hypertens medic methyldopa induc cholestasi prescrib new dr while hospit diagnos atrial fibril 2de result normal lv size systol function no rwma lvef 59 normal pasp 26mmhg trivial aortic tricuspid regurig aspirin 100 mg prescrib ecg attach her hospit chest apsit result the heart size accur assess appear enlarg there mild promin hilar vessel suggest mild congest she recruit warfarin vs apixaban doubl blind clinic trial start treatment aug4 2009 we later found warfarin w dosag unknown us 14 day wafarin treatment fell caus fall unknown accord friend walk right next mom stop walk forward drop floor hit back head she conscious mobil initi repeat brain ct scan hospit day due drop gcn the second ct scan shown much larger bleed due blood thin effect warfarin she becam semiconsci loss sens control left side ct brain result 1 acut subarachnoid subdur haemorrhag 2 pneumocephalus occipit bone fractur left haemotympanum blood product sphenoid sinus 3 haemorrhag contus left occipit lobe old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus her inr 35 due warfarin luckili extens rehab abl regain 90 physic mental abil she discharg 911 the blood test sept 14 visit cardiologist haematolog within rang platelet clump note biochemistri non fast within rang non clinic signific on follow visit neurologist leg check neurologist indic doe tendenc embol and brain ct scan done sept discharg hospit show blood clot brain almost gone unlik alzheim her bp 11012080 rang she 3 bp medic one stomach 1 amlodipin besil 10 mg 2 lisinopril 20 mg3 atenolol 50 mg omeprazol 20 mg stomach on 928 cardiologist resum warfarin 1 mgday start despit request leav trial switch aspirin when request echocardiogram drs respons we need to do a transesophag echocardiogram a mild invas procedur to detect clot reliabl which is not feasibl howev even if no clot was seen the risk for clot format is still present do an echocardiogram will not chang manag with question 1 given patient neardeath bleed safe continu bloodthin therapi we famili favor use aspirin therapi af mitig risk thromboembol oppos continu warfarin but given near death brainble use warfarin wise use ani blood thinner even low dose aspirin 2 should patient echocardiogram determin natur extent clot ismay form due af what type echocardiogram transthorac transesophag what test see upper chamber mother heart help us determin extent build clot therefor help us form evalu true risk profil embol event due af
818,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted by NCW on June 11; 1999 at 10:22:52 In December; 1998; I was diagnosed with sudden-onset; severe hypertension. About 180/140. They traced it back to July. Prior to that; it had been normal my entire life. I am 40 years old. I've been through a bunch of drug regimens to bring it down with limited success. It's currently about 150/104. I'm on Atenolol (75mg); Hytrin (10mg); Plendil (10mg). I'm also on Lipitor (60mg) for familial hypercholesterolimia. Lately; I've been experiencing severe nausea; dizziness; fatigue; weakness; and headaches whenever I exercise; which is a mixture of walking and weight training. Also; in the past four weeks; I've put on 10 pounds (from 165 lbs to 175lbs/ht: 5' 10""); even though my diet is unchanged. Do you think this is from the medications? Another problem? Or am I just turning into a medical basket case? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 11; 1999 at 10:37:10 Dear NCW You are not a medical basket case. If your blood pressure is 150/100 when you are just sitting around; it is probably much higher when you exercise and especially high when you are weight lifting. Any heavy weight lifting (or exercise) is probably a very bad idea until your blood pressure is under better control. You should also see a specialist in hypertension - either a cardiologist or a nephrologist (kidney doctor) to be evaluated for certain uncommon disorders that can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure); but can be cured. This testing involves blood tests and perhaps a kidney ultrasound. I think this would be very important. Furthermore; once your blood pressure is under better control; if you symptoms on exercise persist; you should be evaluated for coronary artery disease. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to write back. Information provided here is for general purposes only. Specific questions should be addressed to your own doctor. If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center; please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter. The Heart Center website contains a directory of the cardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem. Posted by NCW on June 15; 1999 at 15:07:15 I've been tested for pheochromocytoma; carcinoids; heart problems; and had a renogram in January. What kind of testing would a nephrologist add? Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on June 16; 1999 at 16:58:36 Dear NCW I did not realize that you already had an evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension. A nephrology evaluation would not add anything at this point.

820,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm dealing with tachycardia arrhytmia since more than 2 years now. My Cardilogist at first said it was dysautonomia and POTS and blame also my severe anxiety and was put on a beta blocker; propranolol 20 mg day. At first it was working on to stop the tachycardia but with time the effect wear off and had to increase my dose and then it was lowering too much my blood pressure so my Cardiologist switch me on another beta blocker... I try several ones; bisoprolol; nadolol; timolol; pindolol; acebutolol... All of those fails to control the tachycardia. In those 2 years; I start having more and more heart related symptoms. Chest pain; jaw pain; left arm pain; exercise intolerance; dizziness; vertigo; intestine problems; low energy physically and mentally... I have severe anxiety (panic with agoraphobia; somatisation; GAD; social anxiety). My anxiety is not well control; I'm med sensitive and can't take antidepressants like Paxil; Lexapro or even older ones like imipramine... 1 mg of Paxil send me to the ER and same for Lexapro; didn't had problem with both drugs before and took them for my anxiety for years. I'm on a high dose of clonazepam 7 mg day; I'm addicted and do a very slow tapering withdrawal... Will take years to get off the clonazepam. I also deal with many panic attacks every day; can't get out th house; can't stay alone; everything trigger heart related symptoms like tachycardia or chest pain; a loud sound; music; too much people's around me... My nervous system seem to be overactive... I'm always sick; have chronic headache; heart is pounding in my chest all the time even when my heart rate is normal; droop of blood pressure or high blood pressure; feeling very hot all the time but can't sweat; can't exercise or just walk cause of my low energy and no physical endurance... I saw my Cardiogist 2 weeks ago; he look at my last holter monitor results and said it was anxiety and said that I may have dysautonomia but probably cause of the anxiety... I was stable on 10 mg x 3 of propranolol day for the last 7 months but the tachycardia was not under control at all... He suggest to RX 25 mg x 2 day of metoprolol. I start taking the metoprolol 2 weeks ago. I feel awful! Not only its not helping the tachycardia; but it make my anxiety worse. I have a migraine with throbbing pain in my head since I start it 2 weeks ago. I have more chest pain and left arm and hand are numb most of the time. My jaw hurt and all my teeth also. I have insomnia; have some vision change; my energy level is even lower than on the propranolol. I also feel depression... The propranolol don't do that... I feel so awful that I decrease the dose to 12.5 mg every 12 hours insistead of 25 mg every 12 hours but even with a lower dose I feel very bad. I'm the only one here who have problems with the metoprolol or brand name lopressor? It's the immediate release one; not the XL... I call my Cardio Doc and ask to be put again on the Propranolol but he don't return my phone call back. The only one beta blocker that I never try is the bystolic; it's new in the Canada but too expensive for me. I also hear that for anxiety it's bad? Well share you're experiences with the metoprolol vs propranolol... It can't be all in my head; I mean the side effects from the metoprolol are horrible...,2013,2013,37.0,Male,hi im deal tachycardia arrhytmia sinc 2 year my cardilogist first said dysautonomia pot blame also sever anxieti put beta blocker propranolol 20 mg day at first work stop tachycardia time effect wear increas dose lower much blood pressur cardiologist switch anoth beta blocker i tri sever one bisoprolol nadolol timolol pindolol acebutolol all fail control tachycardia in 2 year i start heart relat symptom chest pain jaw pain left arm pain exercis intoler dizzi vertigo intestin problem low energi physic mental i sever anxieti panic agoraphobia somatis gad social anxieti my anxieti well control im med sensit cant take antidepress like paxil lexapro even older one like imipramin 1 mg paxil send er lexapro didnt problem drug took anxieti year im high dose clonazepam 7 mg day im addict slow taper withdraw will take year get clonazepam i also deal mani panic attack everi day cant get th hous cant stay alon everyth trigger heart relat symptom like tachycardia chest pain loud sound music much peopl around my nervous system seem overact im alway sick chronic headach heart pound chest time even heart rate normal droop blood pressur high blood pressur feel hot time cant sweat cant exercis walk caus low energi physic endur i saw cardiogist 2 week ago look last holter monitor result said anxieti said i may dysautonomia probabl caus anxieti i stabl 10 mg x 3 propranolol day last 7 month tachycardia control he suggest rx 25 mg x 2 day metoprolol i start take metoprolol 2 week ago i feel aw not help tachycardia make anxieti wors i migrain throb pain head sinc i start 2 week ago i chest pain left arm hand numb time my jaw hurt teeth also i insomnia vision chang energi level even lower propranolol i also feel depress the propranolol dont i feel aw i decreas dose 125 mg everi 12 hour insistead 25 mg everi 12 hour even lower dose i feel bad im one problem metoprolol brand name lopressor it immedi releas one xl i call cardio doc ask put propranolol dont return phone call back the one beta blocker i never tri bystol new canada expens i also hear anxieti bad well share your experi metoprolol vs propranolol it cant head i mean side effect metoprolol horribl
821,Atenolol+hypertension,"Have you ever seen a pt with neurocardiogenic syncope become so dizzy it was incapicitating and completely altered their balance? I have hypotension; with SBP in the 60's (on Florinef o.1mg qMWF and Proamatine 2.5mg tid) at times in the am before I even get out of bed. I have POTs and am on Atenolol for HR control which does not help my low BP. I was recently in the hospital with the above problem and am still going to PT working on recovering my balance. The exact cause of the dizzyness etc has not been pinpointed. Speculation is a virus in my inner ear. But I think it is somehow related to my BP issues. I have been having problems for a year now; and the symptoms came on suddenly after a viral illness last year; unusual fatigue; lightheadedness; HR to 150 without much exertion and and increase in symptoms with high HR. I have been to the syncope clinic there and recently had a hemodynamic test. What I really want to know is if it is possible that the problems I am having now have anything to do with the syncope; couldn't possibly; or maybe are contributing to make the problem worse. I also have been having chest pains; which everything in the world has been ruled out. I had a right heart cath which showed mild pulm HTN (then Florinef was decreased from qd to the present qMWF) and they ruled out my gall bladder. I was started on neurontin thinking it was a neurologic pain; and the pain had diminished. I stopped taking it to see if that was helping; and the pain did return after one day.

823,Atenolol+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing. I'm just looking for any reassurance that anyone can give me. Hopefully someone has been through similar. I feel so healthy when I'm not dealing with this stuff every night. How worried should I be?,2009,2009,29.0,Male,i crosspost hope get differ perspect ive experienc pleas feel free read first thread i post anxieti forum ill answer question thread well headsup detail histori anxieti possibl heart problem my recent issu i wake middl night elev puls skyrocket within moment wake i went back cardiologist thursday told ekg show thicken heart muscl she review echo two year ago told show sign thicken well i went cardiologist hope allay health anxieti wors im bit mif doctor didnt keep inform go echo all i ever heard valv leak bit abnorm amount age 29 im go new echo monday ill stress test soon the stress test scare ive got stay atenolol 48 hour hand ill deal puls elev probabl wors incid heart race im look reassur anyon give hope someon similar i feel healthi im deal stuff everi night how worri i
824,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 47 year old female diagnosed with HCM in 1995. I have always had abnormal EKGs with q waves in II; III and AVF. In the years prior to 1995 I began to demonstrate a strain pattern in the chest leads. I had a echo in 1989 that was normal but the echo of 1995 showed concentric hypertrophy and a diastolic dysfunction. I have been a fitness buff for many years and began having SOB after 6 months of heavy intesity work on the nordic track in 1992. I switched to swimming without SOB and returned the nordic track after about 4 months of swimming. I again developed SOB after six months and also began to have non exercise c/p. After my diagnosis at the Naval Hospital at Bethesda; MD I was consulted to NIH (NHLBI)who concurred with Bethesda's diagnosis. I stopped excising and developed a baseline tachycardia after about 5 months. I also developed a mild hypertension (130/90). I was placed on atenolol 50mg qd. I did well until I had a TIA episode that lasted about 2 hours. This occured after about 7 months on atenolol.By then I had moved to Florida. My extensive neuro and cardiac w/u was negative. My heart size and function was entirely normal; though my EKG still demonstrated small q waves in II; III and AVF. Recently my echo again demonstrates concentric hypertrophy. My question: Can HCM regress? Can ACE inhibitors be substitued for atenolol. I know NIH is doing work in this area. I want to avoid the long term effects of LVH but would like to continue my exercise program as it has many benefits for middle aged women. I have a cardiology appointment with University of Fl. cardiology group pending.

825,Atenolol+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think?

827,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm a 25 year-old female college student. I've had migraines since I was 13. I was (finally) diagnosed with intracranial hypertension at 21; Chiari Malformation at 22; and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome at 23. I've seen neurologists in New Jersey (my home state); Philadelphia; New York; and Maryland. I had a craniotomy/decompression; duraplasty; and laminectomy of C1 three months after my Chiari diagnosis at a well known hospital. It has been three years and I consider the surgery an utter failure. I am no different than I was before (with the added benefit of a psuedomeningocele!). My last cine flow (post surgery) shows I still have a blockage. I have tried more medications than I can count and they either do nothing or the side effects are so terrible that I can't stay on them long enough to find out it they'll work. I seem to be stuck in a cycle right now where I go see the neurologist; get a new med to try; have it fail; and have to deal with the migraines for another 6 months to a year until my next visit. Is this how things normally go once surgery has failed? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated - and please; if a med has worked for you; let me know! I go back to see my neurologist in a couple of weeks (only the third time; she just took over my case because my old neurologist was so busy I could barely ever see him) and I want to be prepared. -Kulili-,2011,2011,25.0,Female,hi im 25 yearold femal colleg student ive migrain sinc i 13 i final diagnos intracrani hypertens 21 chiari malform 22 ehlersdanlo syndrom 23 ive seen neurologist new jersey home state philadelphia new york maryland i craniotomydecompress duraplasti laminectomi c1 three month chiari diagnosi well known hospit it three year i consid surgeri utter failur i differ i ad benefit psuedomeningocel my last cine flow post surgeri show i still blockag i tri medic i count either noth side effect terribl i cant stay long enough find theyll work i seem stuck cycl right i go see neurologist get new med tri fail deal migrain anoth 6 month year next visit is thing normal go surgeri fail ani feedback would great appreci pleas med work let know i go back see neurologist coupl week third time took case old neurologist busi i could bare ever see i want prepar kulili
828,Atenolol+hypertension,I have a confession..... I relapsed; but on a small scale. As some of you may know; I am addicted to Percocets and quit over the long holiday of Christmas and New Years. I started work at a VERY demanding job (in politics) that has me working non-stop 14-16 hours per day right after I quit. I couldn't do it. I could not cope. I was having panic attacks and was not able to do my job. I went back on the pills. However; it's not as bad as it sounds. I'm taking 1 pill to 1 1/2 pills per day so I can do my job. I simply tried to quit at the wrong time. I also sought out a doctor to help me. He has diagnosed me with depression and generalized anxiety disorder and he put me on Lexapro which combats both diseases. He thinks I have been self medicating with the Percocets and is helping me taper off the Percs while the Lexapro does it's job. The Lexapro has already started working and I am feeling MUCH better and am able to cope on a small dose of Percocets. The first week was terrible; but now my body is adjusting to the lower amount and the Lexapro is kicking; I'm going to taper even more next week. He wants me to stop taking the Percocets all together in six weeks. It's nice to have the support of my doctor. He's also put me on Atenolol for hypertension because I could not STAND the constant pounding of my heart. He put me on low dosages of Xanax to take when I feel a panic attack coming on. I'm happy to report that the pounding heart has TOTALLY stopped thanks to the Atenolol and I am taking less and less of the Xanax every day. The Lexapro is really working. Today was the best day yet! I'm going to try to go without any Percocets at all this weekend and see how I do. I'm getting more familiar with my new job and I believe I am going to be able to quit the Percocets for good on the current plan I am on. I have a vacation coming up on March 6th for nine days. That is my new quit date. So; that's my confession. Please don't judge me.,2008,2009,41.0,Female,i confess i relaps small scale as may know i addict percocet quit long holiday christma new year i start work veri demand job polit work nonstop 1416 hour per day right i quit i couldnt i could cope i panic attack abl job i went back pill howev bad sound im take 1 pill 1 12 pill per day i job i simpli tri quit wrong time i also sought doctor help he diagnos depress general anxieti disord put lexapro combat diseas he think i self medic percocet help taper perc lexapro job the lexapro alreadi start work i feel much better abl cope small dose percocet the first week terribl bodi adjust lower amount lexapro kick im go taper even next week he want stop take percocet togeth six week it nice support doctor hes also put atenolol hypertens i could stand constant pound heart he put low dosag xanax take i feel panic attack come im happi report pound heart total stop thank atenolol i take less less xanax everi day the lexapro realli work today best day yet im go tri go without percocet weekend see i im get familiar new job i believ i go abl quit percocet good current plan i i vacat come march 6th nine day that new quit date so that confess pleas dont judg
829,Atenolol+hypertension,Normal body weight 115 (30 yr F) but gained 12 pounds in 3 days after start of propranolol. Continued to gain an additional 13 in the next 2 weeks. Began methimazole one-and-a-half weeks after propranolol. I normally eat 1900 calories per day w/moderate activity. Could I have gained 25 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks on that sort of caloric intake? Or is it the medication? DR said I had some fluid retention but made no further comment about the weight gain. Is there something else I can take for hypertension/SVT/sinus tachycardia? Elevated liver enzymes present after 3 wks methimazole usage. TSH and T3 were in normal range as of 2 mo. ago with total T4 still slightly elevated. Wanted to reduce methimazole but DR said no. Why did he say no?

He on the other hand stated that if the BP was up in his offoce he must beleive that it is also up at other times. This being said; he placed me on a starting dose of Avapro; 150 mgs. Several days later I started to have major bouts of depression; very tired; heaviness on my entire left side and also left hand and foot became very cold.I also had frequent palpitations. My head felt like my pressure was elevated but just the oppisite was happening; avg. BP was 116/68. My Internist told me to decrease the medication to 75mgs. and if in a few days I was feeling better then we must assume that these ""feelings"" were coming from the Avapro. She also stated that she has had other people demonstrate these same ""symptoms"" however because angiotension II is a new class of medicines there is still very little data available. After 2 days of 75 mgs. I do feel a little better. I am also decreasing the drug again ; in order to discontinue it entirely. Now I guess my question is; ""is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME"" ? If not; what is one to do when taking additional medication that seem to only agravate the body as a whole? I also recently went through a complete physicial and Cardiolyte Stress test; lipid profile etc; everything was great! Thanks for your help with this matter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear D.L.; Q: Is there really anyway one can openly define WHITE COAT SYNDROME ?. A: ""White coat hypertension"" has been described as high blood pressure that is only elevated in the doctor' office due to the stress of seeing the doctor. Yes; it does exist but no it does not mean that one does not need medication. The reason for this is that no one (at least no one I know) lives in a totally stress free environment. Therefore whenever one is stressed their blood pressure will be high. It is during those high periods that the damage of hypertension is done. Thus it may be beneficial to see what a ""stress"" blood pressure is and to treat based on that number.

832,Atenolol+hypertension,I finally got a chance to post a question here. I posted this a few days ago as a response to someone else's question; but I'd like to get an opinion from an MD on the board as well. The full story is in this URL: http://www.medhelp.org/forums/cardio/messages/35673.html; under the name feelsick2. I'd appreciate if you could read the full story instead of this post. The summaryis as follows: I'm 28; 178 pounds; normal resting blood pressure 115/75; pulse 72. No major health problems before. No heart problems in parents (both alive; 55 yrs old) or grandparents (all passed away around 82 yrs old) One day; woke up with a sore throat and mild fever (99.8); took a TheraFlu (aspirin). Then 2 hours later; started feeling weird; dizzy; started feeling a bit of pulsations in my chest and head. Things started to get worse in 10 mins; and suddenly; my heart was racing; my hands and feet were tingling and numb and I was sweating and flushing. (no chest pain; shortness of breath). Went back home to rest. Major complaint the next couple days were a strong feeling of pulsations INSIDE my head; often in my neck; face; ears and jaw. No pain or headache. Couldn't go to work because these feelings were making me dizzy; After 2 days of rest; one night these pulsations started getting worse again; so that morning I went to my PCP. Since then (it has been 3 months now); I have these pulsations in my head. I have had 2 MRI/MRAs; 2 Chest-x-rays; Cardio consult; Neuro consult; ENT consult; all non-conclusive. The details of these workups are in my long post.

833,Atenolol+hypertension,First of all; thank you for all your responses; they've been very helpful. The event monitor showed only PVC's. The stress echo test looked great except for one thing: The tricuspid valve is leaky. The doctor didn't think it looked too serious. He wants to look at it again in a year. Could this be connected to the PVC's or the painful PVC's? Does it cause anxiety like mitral valve prolaps seems to? Or; could my anxiety have caused the tricuspid problem? What is a typical prognoses for someone with this? I also get pressure in my face and sometimes dizziness: Could this be related to the tricuspid? As mentioned in the original post; I have had breathing trouble for the past four years. Could my breathing difficulty be pulmonary hypertension resulting from the tricuspid anomaly? When breathing is tough; I'll get the erg for a deep breath; I'll try to take it; but I wont get that satisfied feeling. There's no fluid in the lungs; no wheezing and no asthma. In fact; doctors have not been able to give a diagnoses. My breathing gets better with regular exercise; and; when it's been bad enough for the ER my oxygen saturation has always been normal. Except for what I've mentioned here; I don't seem to have other symptoms of pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid regurgitation. Or; does my breathing difficulty sound anxiety related? Thanks again for your help Tim,1999,2001,,,first thank respons theyv help the event monitor show pvcs the stress echo test look great except one thing the tricuspid valv leaki the doctor didnt think look serious he want look year could connect pvcs pain pvcs doe caus anxieti like mitral valv prolap seem or could anxieti caus tricuspid problem what typic prognos someon i also get pressur face sometim dizzi could relat tricuspid as mention origin post i breath troubl past four year could breath difficulti pulmonari hypertens result tricuspid anomali when breath tough ill get erg deep breath ill tri take i wont get satisfi feel there fluid lung wheez asthma in fact doctor abl give diagnos my breath get better regular exercis bad enough er oxygen satur alway normal except ive mention i dont seem symptom pulmonari hypertens tricuspid regurgit or breath difficulti sound anxieti relat thank help tim
834,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 27 year old man from Indiana. For the past three years I have been to two family doctors; two neurologists and three cardiologists because I have fainting spells on average every 4-6 days. From November 1998 when they started to January of 2001; they have maintained this ""schedule""; however; on January 15th; 2001; I had a fainting spell and when I ""woke up;"" I had lost feeling and function of both of my legs. This has continued with every blackout I have had since. I do have warning signs before the blackouts occur. I get dizzy; lightheaded; and have blurred vision. The last sign I have before I faint is tingling or numbness in my hands and feet. These warning signs happen every time before I have a blackout. The blackouts; according to those people around me when I have them; last 10-15 minutes. Periodically; my feet will turn blue for no reason and this does not happen during a blackout or just before one either. The diagnosis for my problem is neurocardiogenic syncope; although the cardioloigsts are not confident in this because I do not recover quickly after a blackout. It takes up to 48 hours sometimes to recover from a blackout. The current cardiologist I have started me on beta blockers (Atenolol first and then Betaxolol); which have caused a complete loss of energy. The cardiologist took me off of those and put me on Florinef; so that my blood vessels would remain dialated. This medication has caused my blackouts to occur more frequently. The next stage the cardiologist has suggested involves a drug that causes hypertension and can do damage to my heart; which he is retisent to put me on because of my young age and because I suffer from hypotension. For your information; I have had the following tests; all which have come back negative: EKG; EEG; MRI on my brain and my thoracic spinal cord; Doppler Arterial Flow on my legs and arms; blood tests for my thyroid and diabetes; treadmill test; and electrocardio catheters checking my heart and valve function. I did have two tilt table tests; both of which came back positive for neurocardiogenic syncope; which is the only test I had that has come back positive. During the EEG; my first cardiologist found I had an arrhythmia. I would appreciate any suggestion you may have on what is wrong with me. If my current cardiologist does not put me on the drug that causes hypertension; then he has suggested sending me to the Mayo Clinic or to Cleveland Clinic; which is why I am posting this question. Thank you for reading this question and I would appreciate any information you could offer to shed light on this problem I am having.

836,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy several months ago; that is thought to be caused by taking a new biologic injection for Psoriatic Arthritis. I have chest pains daily; along with shortness of breath on exertion. My angiogram showed all the heart arteries to be clear; so why am i still having chest pains? Also; all my cardiologist has treated me with is Altace 10mg once a day. Is my cariologist being aggressive enough? He seems to think my chest pains are not of concern since my angiogram showed clear arteries. I've been off the biologic medicine since late September and have not seen any improvement in my chest pains and shortness of breath. Do you think my heart will return to normal size and function?

837,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago (which was initially controlled via wel-known BP medications; but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons.) In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. ECG results: 4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/09: AF; T abnormalities 8/09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin?

838,Atenolol+hypertension,My husband is being treated for hbp since June/98. He has been on both ace inhibitors and beta blockers from low to high doses. At this point his pressure has remained unchanged. It averages between 150/95 - 170-112. He is on the highest dose of atenolol(?). He has been on 100mg. for approx. 1 week now with no change. I have several concerns at this point. His weight; diet is good. He moderately exercises; stress level is high. 1. He may have had undetected hbp for any length of time previous to June. 2. Since June there has been no change which is prolonging the condition with possible effects? 3. What normally causes resistance to the medication and what could be causing it and could there be permanent organ damage? I am concerned about the time lag and am not sure is he should be seeing a specialist at this point.

839,Atenolol+hypertension,My husband has just been told he has atrail fibrillation and his heart is enlarged. No one seems to know the exact cause and he's been told to take one asprin daily and to avoid alcohol and caffeine.Should we be concerned? My husband has always been easy to upset and gets stressed ofter could strees be the cause of this problem and if so what can he do about it. Will taking medication for stress help because no matter how hard he trys not to let things upset him they still do. Also; we have always had suspicions that he is ADHD could this be a factor. My husband has always been a strong hard working man; but; I've notice in the past year to year and a half he's not been himself he complains often about not feeling well and doesn't feel like doing as much as before all this. I guess what I'm looking for is answers to many questions; like should he not do the job he's been doing for the past 20yrs which is extremely hard and dangerous work(he's a iron worker).He was told to avoid beer but he's thinks if he had a few once a month it won't matter is he right.Should he exercise more? What should he life style be like.Is having atrial figrillation and an enlarged heart moe dangerous than having just one of these conditions or is one just a factor to the other. thank you; Paula,1999,2000,,,my husband told atrail fibril heart enlarg no one seem know exact caus hes told take one asprin daili avoid alcohol caffeineshould concern my husband alway easi upset get stress ofter could stree caus problem will take medic stress help matter hard trys let thing upset still also alway suspicion adhd could factor my husband alway strong hard work man ive notic past year year half hes complain often feel well doesnt feel like much i guess im look answer mani question like job hes past 20yr extrem hard danger workh iron workerh told avoid beer hes think month wont matter rightshould exercis what life style likei atrial figril enlarg heart moe danger one condit one factor thank paula
840,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 34 year old female; in relativley good health. I had an episode of tachycardia 5 years ago. My heart rate went up to 140bpm for no reason. It stayed there for 2 hours before I called paramedics. They hooked me up to moniter and said everything was fine; probably PAC? Since then I have had nothing of that nature; it was like a panic attack heart episode that lasted way too long. Heavy and pounding. Three times I have had episodes of bradychardia in the past 5 years; where my heart rate has dropped to 47-57 and I have felt extreme fatigue and once shortness of breath. I also have experienced many times; rapid heart rate after laying down to go to sleep. 90-110bpm. This was not as pounding as the tachycardia; While working as a waitress; sometimes by the end of the shift; I would get rapid heart rate of up to 112-115; and could not make it go away until I had slept all night.Also at times I will feel my heart flutter; like a series of skipped beats; this too is during times of stress; usually when I try to rest. Various doctors that I have seen have told me it is nothing to worry about. I have not seen a cardiologist. I was just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist; who suggested that i get in to see a cardiologist right away. Now I am afraid and anxious that there may be something horrible wrong with me. I have always been prone to panic and anxiety. Have had panic attacks in the past. And it does seem to have some connection with emotional stress. Does this sound like anything textbook; or is my heart just reacting to stress?

844,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I have been taking Inderal for 2-3 years. I have recently become pregnant. (1-2months) I take 10mg total a day. A half a pill in the morning; and a half a pill at night. This seemed to help all my symptoms with MVPS. I spoke to my cardiologist and he said he thinks I should not take it anymore. He told me I should wean myself off of it. I took 4 half pill a day for four days; then one-half a pill every other day for four days. I didn't take one yesterday at all and today I took my last half a pill. Should I get some symptoms? Will my heart rate speed up? And how long will it take to get out of my system?

845,Atenolol+hypertension,"My husband has started having periods where he feels like his heart is racing. He is 48 years old and has been on HCTZ for 4 years. Blood pressure is under control. We walk a few times a week and are basically fit. He went to the doctor to make sure the racing heart wasn't something more serious. The doctor listened to his heart and did an EKG. He said it seemed fine. He drew some blood. He said his potassium was off a little and his thyroid was off a little. He suggested eating bananas and oranges; take an aspirin a day; work on stress management and exercise more. He said he thought the racing heart was due to stress. Couldn't it be due to the potassium and the thyroid being off? His thyroid was ""a little off"" before and he suggested having it tested again in a month. He did that and it was back to normal. Now it is off again. Should something more be done about this? Will this cause a racing heart? Should my husband see a cardiologist? If so; what should be tested?

846,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female with a history of PVC's. They were very bad about 23 years ago---especially during pregnancy. I haven't had any bad episodes for approximately 8 years. A few months ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and I am now on Inderal---20mg. three times a day. This seems to control my blood pressure. After I had been on the Inderal for about a month I began to have the PVC's again. It seems like these episodes are as bad; if not worse; than during pregnancy. I figured that these were triggered by the Inderal; but my doctor didn't think so. She did order a holter monitor and she called a few days later to tell me that I needed to see a cardiologist. She did not go into detail about the results---she just said that she saw enough to know that I needed to see someone else. It seems likely to me; that somehow the Inderal is aggravating the arrhythmia. I have learned from this website that my PVC's are likely to be vagally mediated. They are worse when I rest from activity and when I lay down at night. Based on what I have told you--Is there a possiblity that Inderal could be somehow causing or aggravating this problem and what would be a good alternative? Are there other BP meds that I should also avoid under these circumstances? Thank you so very much for any insight you might be able to offer!,2004,2004,,,i 43 year old femal histori pvcs they bad 23 year agoespeci pregnanc i havent bad episod approxim 8 year a month ago i diagnos high blood pressur i inderal20mg three time day this seem control blood pressur after i inder month i began pvcs it seem like episod bad wors pregnanc i figur trigger inder doctor didnt think she order holter monitor call day later tell i need see cardiologist she go detail resultssh said saw enough know i need see someon els it seem like somehow inder aggrav arrhythmia i learn websit pvcs like vagal mediat they wors i rest activ i lay night base i told youi possibl inder could somehow caus aggrav problem would good altern are bp med i also avoid circumst thank much insight might abl offer
847,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am a 43 year old male; never smoked and about 25lbs overweight in spite of exercise. Since mid-December; I've had PACs and have been subsequently diagnosed with ectopic atrial tachycardia. The problems started when I had a cold and took allegra-d. I had a lot of premature beats which disappeared within 24 hours. The problem has been reoccurring in spite of my elimination of caffeine and other stimulants. I also had a couple episodes of tachycardia that would last for a few seconds; stop; start again and thus resulting in a pretty chaotic heartbeat. I had a nuclear stress test; echo; event monitor and all tests are normal. Also thyroid function; potassium levels; etc are normal. I'm currently taking cardizem LA 120mg and atenolol xl 50mg. I continue to have skipped beats but no real events of tachycardia. I met with an EP and he said that I should consider a PVI but scared me quite a bit by talking a lot about the amount of risk of a PVI vs. other types of ablation. He also implied that my condition will most likely progress into afib. So 2 questions: 1) Am I more or less likely to experience afib given the above facts? 2) Can you provide some info on the risks of PVI vs. anti-arrythmic drugs (assuming my condition worsens and I have to make a choice)?

849,Atenolol+hypertension,"About 5 months ago I was diagnosed with Depression NOS and Anxiety at Mayo Clinic. Evaluations by two psychiatrists and a therapist have revealed no ""emotional"" cause - Mayo Clinic's best ""guess"" was a viral infection causing a biological inbalance. I am currently going to therapy to deal better with stress and anxiety. For the chemical inbalance; I have been taking Paxil along with Trazadone for sleep. The problem is that the Paxil works great for a few weeks then seems to ""poop out"". I am steadily improving but keep having dips back that are starting to scare me. My Dr. first added desipramine to boost the Paxil (it helped at first; then made me extremely tired and stopped working in 4-5 weeks. He then tried Welbutrin but it made me way too nervous so it was stopped in a few days. Then a few weeks ago he increase my dosage of Paxil to 30 mg. For about two weeks I felt great - back to my old self. Then about five days ago I started feeling really sleepy and groggy and all my energy was zapped. I tried to relax and thought it would go away - but it hasn't. Its hard to work and get back to normal life with this sleepiness. I think the 30 mg of Paxil may be too much. (I take 1/2 at 7am and 1/2 at 7pm and sleep great). Now I am getting nervous that I am never going to be back to normal. Do you think I have given Paxil enough time to work? I am considering asking my Dr. to let me try Celexa as I have heard good things about it. What would be involved with switching meds?

852,Atenolol+hypertension,"hi...48 yr old female...mild hypertension-on BP meds...atenolol 50 mg 2 x a day...put on that about 12 yrs ago for palpitations. Healthy other than being overweight...and these darn palpitations. Ive had them for so long. They come and go. Ive been thru all the testing...several times. I went quite a while with no palpitations....months and months. Now; they are back. Going thru a stressful time right now in our family with my mother; and a serious illness.... but...right now things have settled down for a bit... My question today is...Ive noticed a sharp increase in my pvs; pacs; in the past few days. The weekend was a stressful one; with not alot of sleep...so I guess I can figure out what brought them on... but boy are they bad today!! I bet I have 20 a minute or so...not every minute... What seems odd about them is that if I get up and walk across the room; or at work; walk across the building; wow; that really brings them on-I can feel it as Im walking. Like always; I have no other symptoms...but just feel the jumping ;and of course; I reach for my pulse....I am an expert pulse-taker; Im sad to say. If I sit for a long period of time; ( we traveled across the state yesterday; so rode in the car all day...) I have a FEW...but when I got out of the car yesterday; and when I walked anywhere today...the palps are just firing up. Its so distressing---I get so upset---which makes it worse...but my gosh; its hard to live with these; as the Drs tell you to; ya know?? I wonder...How long is an echo; ekg; stress test & holter ""good"" for? I ask; because I had the whollllllle workup in April 08. So; just over a year. It was expensive--- and they made me feel like a hypochondriac...when they were putting the holter on me; the technolgist says...you are having this put on...for palpitations?? Like...that was ridiculous.... I am not in good physical shape---so my stress test was short--but the cardiologist said it was fine--normal--nothing alarming. So..that is my question... anytime I get these back...my first instinct...is to run to the Dr. But really...I dont know that should. Theyve told me they are benign....and to ""not worry"" about them.

Here is a little more information from my physician. Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further.

854,Atenolol+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7. Also World Journal of Gastroenterology 2005;11(48):7560-7563 has an article on losartan and fibrosis and there are other articles on the Internet.,2009,2009,,Male,i liver transplant 2000 get cirrhosi follow hepat abvd chemotherapi fail interferon alpha therapi unfortun hcv elimin i ran across articl indic losartancozaar blood pressur medicin may reduc elimin fibrosi i ask doctor chang blood pressur medicin coincid visit detect fibrosi feel stiff liver the hepat stellat cell hscs activ myofibroblastlik cell produc fibrosi angiotensin ii losartan act block angiotensin ii receptor cost 6000 per month medicar vasotec cost 500 per month i wonder enalaprilvasotec angiotensinconvert enzym inhibitor would fibrosi reduc effect losartan sinc stop angiotensin ii form first place work well block receptor angiotensin ii dock cheaper cost i found posit answer chines medic journal 2001 vol 114 no 6 page 5837 also world journal gastroenterolog 2005114875607563 articl losartan fibrosi articl internet

861,Atenolol+hypertension,"Before I rush to a doctor and look like a hypochondriac I thought I'd shoot a question here: I woke up this morning and I have been couching/gaging all morning and can taste blood in the back of my throat; I have not coughed up any blood though. I have been trying to quit smoking since 2011 and have been a smoker since 1991. I am also on SR Hydromorphone (Jurnisa) for severe chronic back pain. I am also on 800Mg Carbamazapine (as a Mood stabilizer NOT for Epilepsy) As well as Mirtazepine (for chronic Clinical Depression) And Atenolol for mild Hypertension. Anyhoo; as of this morning I have been hacking up a storm; as of 2 hours from waking up I developed a sore throat (I believe from the hard coughing) I have not coughed anything up but the coughing gets so hard it becomes dry-reacing frequently. And that taste of blood waay down in the back of my throat is ever present after each cough.

862,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I'm 53; male; not overweight. I was diagnosed with HBP when I was 28. Originally treated with atenelol; until change of doctor switched me to 30mg Coracten and 20mg lisinopril (13 years ago). I found the combo effective; regular monitoring showed BP controlled; no side effects. about 16 months ago I noticed I was getting dizzy; standing up; and dizzy after exercise. I stopped the coracten. Doc confirmed BP ok without coracten. However; dizziness continued and I stopped half of the lisinopril; then stopped another quarter; then completely. Monitored my own BP; went to doc who confirmed ok. Typical reading sitting now was 117/76. Needless to say I was delighted and amazed. However; my troubles seemed only to be starting. I continued to be slightly lightheaded after exercise; and a feeling of pins and needles in my scalp and upper face started. I thought it may have been from my neck. I travel a lot and had an episode of confusion; dizziness / vertigo at a hotel after a large meal. I had an urge to eat sweet stuff; which relieved some of my symptoms at the time (since been tested for reactive hypoglycemia -negative; although I think blood sugar was involved on a coupe of occasions). Due to ongoing 'out of it' feeling and worsening prickling on face and in eyes I spent months off work. I was put on a 24hr BP cuff which came back as an average 'normal'. I dont really understand how my high BP of 25 years dissapeared within a matter of months; and is it a coincidence that my new symptoms almost coincided with the last doses of lisinopril. I have been to a neurologist who has mentioned dysesthsia; and has done a MRI of my head (still await results). I feel that the 'out of it feeling' is worse and the prickling; almost numbness; (like a dentist anesthetic wearing off) in my scalp and face is worse. I don't think I'm going to keel over; but I just cant understand the chain of events. My only note would be that my HR after eating goes a bit wild and I have the urge to lie/sit down. Standing without eating my systolic can now be low 100's; yet the diastolic seems stable at about 80. Normal limits I suppose. I just feel weird. I exercise regularly. My doc thinks 'your fine'; but I don't feel it and I am neither anxious or depressed. Can high blood pressure resolve like this ? Could my BP medication have caused some kind of permanent withdrawal and cause my symptoms ? The neurologist has recommended duloxotine; which I was hoping to avoid but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. :( Thanks for reading,2014,2014,52.0,Male,hi im 53 male overweight i diagnos hbp i 28 origin treat atenelol chang doctor switch 30mg coracten 20mg lisinopril 13 year ago i found combo effect regular monitor show bp control side effect 16 month ago i notic i get dizzi stand dizzi exercis i stop coracten doc confirm bp ok without coracten howev dizzi continu i stop half lisinopril stop anoth quarter complet monitor bp went doc confirm ok typic read sit 11776 needless say i delight amaz howev troubl seem start i continu slight lighthead exercis feel pin needl scalp upper face start i thought may neck i travel lot episod confus dizzi vertigo hotel larg meal i urg eat sweet stuff reliev symptom time sinc test reactiv hypoglycemia negat although i think blood sugar involv coup occas due ongo feel worsen prickl face eye i spent month work i put 24hr bp cuff came back averag normal i dont realli understand high bp 25 year dissapear within matter month coincid new symptom almost coincid last dose lisinopril i neurologist mention dysesthsia done mri head still await result i feel feel wors prickl almost numb like dentist anesthet wear scalp face wors i dont think im go keel i cant understand chain event my note would hr eat goe bit wild i urg liesit stand without eat systol low 100s yet diastol seem stabl 80 normal limit i suppos i feel weird i exercis regular my doc think fine i dont feel i neither anxious depress can high blood pressur resolv like could bp medic caus kind perman withdraw caus symptom the neurologist recommend duloxotin i hope avoid i dont seem get anywher thank read

I am on a weight reduction program and have lost nearly 40 lbs. so far. I suffer from hypertension and rapid heart rate; as well as unstable angina and mild CHF. My medications include 40 mg monopril; 40 mg lasix; 100 mg atenolol; 20 mg isordil; and 0.4 mg sublingual nitro as needed. I walk 5 days a week in the evening and am now up to about 1/3 mile a day. I understand that because of the atenolol my heartrate will rarely go above 100; but it takes several hours to come back down to its resting rate of 60-65 after walking. Some days; it only comes down to around 80-85 and stays there until the next morning when I take my next dose. My physician doubled my atenolol from 50 mg to 100 mg because I was having chest pain difficulties at night along with increased heart rate. Unfortunately; taking 50 mg twice a day caused insomnia at night so I have to take the entire dosage at once in the morning. My question is: Am I getting adequate exercise for my heart? Why does it not return to resting rate within a reasonable amount of time? How can I help myself to ensure proper exercise without doing more damage to my heart?

865,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By CCF Cardio MD-SGM on March 21; 1998 at 13:17:41: In Reply to: palpitations posted by jeanette on March 12; 1998 at 01:20:21: : This is long. Please bear with me. I am a 39 year old mother of 5. I am overweight and have hypertension for which I take 25mg. of atenolol daily. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis 15 years ago just a few months after the birth of my first child. The endocrinologist I was sent to at the time put me on replacement thyroid at the first visit because he said I would eventually become hypothyroid. Shortly after beginning replacement; I went to the emergency room with an irregular heartbeat; I was sent to an internist who did a 24 hr.Holter; told me I had PACs and PVCs and was out of shape because my heart rate was too fast. My weight at that time was 50 lbs. lighter than presently and I was moderately active. I tried very hard to correct this ""defect"" by trying to be less stressed; exercise;etc. I was not consuming stimulants and avoided medication because I was breast feeding. During the next nine years I had four more kids and off and on irregular beats; including episodes of tachycardia and premature beats (as well as frightening episodes in which I felt as if my heart and a large vein below it were ""shuddering""); angina-like chest and arm pain; and a subjective bruit in my right ear in certain postures; for which I had consultations with cardiologists and one neurologist (for the bruit because I also have migraines) who ordered one more Holter; 2 treadmills; 2 echocardiograms and recommended a thallium scan (not done due to nursing another child); as well as a CAT scan and carotid ultrasound for the bruit. I was told I had no evident heart disease. I still had the scary palpitations; no confirmation as to their origin; and; despite several successful attempts to increase my cardiovascular fitness; no response to being in better condition. There was concern that I had MVP; but the echos; both done 5+ years ago; supposedly indicated I did not have a prolapse (one of the techs who did one echo indicated he thought I did and one of my family doctors thought I did as well because he was sure he had heard a ""click""? when listening to my heart - he had sent me for the echo). After a scary final birth almost six years ago; during which I hemorrhaged heavily; I once again had more palpitations; and developed mild hypertension about 3 years ago (due I'm sure to my persistent overweight and genetics). I got fed up with all of it and requested my original thyroid labs from many years previous. I was not surprised to learn that my initial tests indicated that I was HYPERthyroid (which I was never told and for which I did not receive any symptomatic treatment) and that my thyroid levels over the years had occasionally indicated too much suppression (the kind I had read was associated with bone loss). I asked my family doctor to let me wean off the thyroid and; lo and behold; my levels were normal and have stayed that way for five years (I was tested as recently as two months ago). I still have evidence of antithyroid antibodies and imagine I will become hypothyroid eventually. Despite going off the thyroid meds; and going on atenolol for hypertension 5 months ago; I continue to have these irregular beats. I have not noted a single pattern; except that they can be triggered or made worse by stimulants; ovulation and mensruation; emotional stress; allergy (when I have hives or at certain times of the year); and certain postures. I have recently had several weeks of increasing palpitations - the worst I've had in years - and I am once again frightened. I would like someone to help me find the cause and get the palpitations to go away. My questions: Can an episode of untreated hyperthyroidism damage the heart? Would this damage be apparent in subsequent cardiac tests? Can the heart be stimulated by a thyroid ""leaking"" hormone due to antibodies even if the thyroid tests show normal levels? On the atenolol; I get no relief - my palpitations just happen in ""slower motion"". Does this lack of response by my heart indicate an electrical problem? I haven't had an echo or treadmill in 5 years; a chest x-ray in 3 (ie; no tests except a 5 minute EKG strip since I became hypertensive) and never a thallium scan - should these be repeated? My new family doctor suggested switching from atenolol to verapamil- should I request certain tests before making that change? Is a test of my heart's electrophysiology a good idea? Unrelated to the thyroid; can a hiatal hernia or esophogeal spasm or reflux trigger arrythmias? I have reflux when laying down or bending at the waist and have had a sensation of something being in my chest when I lay on my left side at night for the past year and I wonder if my stomach is pressing upward? Could this cause sharp pain in the heart synchronous with each beat? (I've had 3 such episodes standing and reclining) No one has looked into whether or not I have a hernia. Finally; I have some concern that I have sleep apnea since my weight has risen this past year. I have palpitations at night and terrible chest ""rushes"" that waken me when I have nightmares - weird pain that runs from my chest down both arms and has left an odd lingering pain for as much as a day subsequent. Would testing for apnea be a good idea (I know weight loss would!) In addition to these ""weird"" pains I have angina-like pain - sometimes when upset; sometimes when I ingest stimulants (I've had them a few times at rest and also a couple of times when getting painkillers at the dentist -the dentist told me the shots have a stimulant effect) - this happens less often since I've been on the atenolol. Thank you for your time. _ Dear Jeanette; From your question; I gather that your most significant complaint is palpitations. I will attempt to address this issue and provide some recommendations and reassurance. Palpitations; as you know; often represent premature or ""extra"" heart beats that arise from the ventricles (PVC's) or the atria (PAC's). In the presence of a structurally normal heart (i.e. no history of ventricular dysfunction or significant coronary artery disease) these irregular beats are benign. I want to reiterate this; because I think it's a crucial point: If a heart is normal; palpitations pose no risk to the patient. I hope that this is reassuring. Many factors such as increased thyroid hormone levels (possibly exacerbated by therapy you were receiving) caffeine; alcohol; cigarettes and other stimulants can increase the incidence of PVC's and PAC's. Often; treatment with beta-blocking medications such as atenolol or possibly calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can reduce the frequency and symptoms of palpitations. Hyperthyroidism can exacerbate or cause palpitations and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias); however its effects are not permanent; and tend to resolve when thyroid hormone levels return to normal. In regards to esophageal reflux; sometimes this can produce palpitations by irritating the atrial chambers of the heart; which lie adjacent to the esophagus. Therapy for reflux includes antacids; H-2 blocking and other drugs like Pepcid or Tagamet; weight loss; and possibly surgical therapy for resistant cases. Sleep apnea can sometimes cause heart rhythm abnormalities; and can produce other complications such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). If you have a history of loud snoring or have been witnessed to stop breathing for intermittent periods during sleep; you may wish to be evaluated for this condition with a sleep study. It appears that you've undergone extensive testing of the heart. I don't believe that repetition of these tests would yield any additional information. One consideration is performing recordings of your palpitations with an event recorder which you could turn on when you're experiencing the problem. This would identify whether you have PVC's or alternatively suffer from an arrhythmia. In either case; an electrophysiologic study of the heart may be helpful. This procedure can sometimes be used to cure arrhythmias; and in some cases can also remove the source of PVC's. Something to consider. Hope I've been of help.

Specific diagnoses and therapies can only be provided by your physician.",1997,1995,,,post by ccf cardio mdsgm march 21 1998 131741 in repli palpit post jeanett march 12 1998 012021 this long pleas

866,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi. I am a 37 y/o female not overweight; I don't smoke. Not diabetic. My cholesterol and blood sugar were just checked and are good. I have hypothyroidism; but I am on medication and that was recently checked and is within normal limits. I do have asthma and am taking medication for that. Over the past two months I have had the following symptoms. I wake up in the night not quite feeling well. I usually feel a bit weak in my arms and nauseated. Usually I have heart palpitations and chest pain. Then my heart will start pounding and I will usually get up to head for the bathroom because I think I am going to vomit. I feel very weak and am shaking. I then notice my heart is racing. When I take my pulse; it is usually between 160-180. I don't really notice feeling anxious; I am usually half asleep and after the episode passes; I just want to go back to bed. My pulse usually comes back down within 5 minutes. Then I start to get the chills. By the time I am thinking I should call 911; the episode passes I feel dumb about calling 911. I also notice my skin looks funny; kind of a reddish color on my face and arms and my hands and feet are a strange grey color? I have had these symptoms approx. 8 times over the past 2 months and always at night. I do take medication for anxiety. The only symptoms I notice during the day is that I sometimes have shortness of breath and palpitations and sometimes my blood pressure is high. But I figured it was because of my asthma.,2009,2009,,Female,hi i 37 yo femal overweight i dont smoke not diabet my cholesterol blood sugar check good i hypothyroid i medic recent check within normal limit i asthma take medic over past two month i follow symptom i wake night quit feel well i usual feel bit weak arm nauseat usual i heart palpit chest pain then heart start pound i usual get head bathroom i think i go vomit i feel weak shake i notic heart race when i take puls usual 160180 i dont realli notic feel anxious i usual half asleep episod pass i want go back bed my puls usual come back within 5 minut then i start get chill by time i think i call 911 episod pass i feel dumb call 911 i also notic skin look funni kind reddish color face arm hand feet strang grey color i symptom approx 8 time past 2 month alway night i take medic anxieti the symptom i notic day i sometim short breath palpit sometim blood pressur high but i figur asthma
867,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 36; non smoker non drinker; no history of heart disease in family; non excersizing and 40 pounds over weight; female. 11 months ago I developed a terrible chest cold and coughed for months. When I went to the Dr. they found I have high blood pressure ( again... I did in my late 20s but it went away with two children) of 160 over 90. I was put on atenolol. shortly after that; i started having alarming arm and chest discomfort. It was random; both at reat and during excersize. Flash forward to recently; I had an echo that found an slightly enlarged left ventricle. I have terrible heart palps even on the Bystolic; and now; today; I spiked a high BP reading 160 over 100 only 2 minutes into the treadmill; so he ended the test. I was sent home; to wait three weeks for a nuclear stress test. My question is this; why am I home with arm and chest pains? If I am having arm; neck chest and sometimes even jaw discomfort; plus palps; spiking BP; enlarged Lft. ventricle; leaky valve; and dizzy spells; why wasn't I admitted? Why send me home with a blood pressure cuff and tell me to make an appt for a nuclear test in three weeks? He told me the chance of me having ablockage is low; but Im thinking; im fat; im 36... I think theres a pretty good chance right? So I am sitting home; arm hurting every time I exhert myself or try to get a good night sleep hoping I dont have a sudden heart attack... should I go to a new cardiologist? This one seems good; but now Im not sure. Why his blasie attitude; because Im young? thank you!!!!,2009,2009,,,i 36 non smoker non drinker histori heart diseas famili non excers 40 pound weight femal 11 month ago i develop terribl chest cold cough month when i went dr found i high blood pressur i late 20s went away two children 160 90 i put atenolol short start alarm arm chest discomfort it random reat excers flash forward recent i echo found slight enlarg left ventricl i terribl heart palp even bystol today i spike high bp read 160 100 2 minut treadmil end test i sent home wait three week nuclear stress test my question i home arm chest pain if i arm neck chest sometim even jaw discomfort plus palp spike bp enlarg lft ventricl leaki valv dizzi spell wasnt i admit whi send home blood pressur cuff tell make appt nuclear test three week he told chanc ablockag low im think im fat im 36 i think there pretti good chanc right so i sit home arm hurt everi time i exhert tri get good night sleep hope i dont sudden heart attack i go new cardiologist this one seem good im sure whi blasi attitud im young thank
868,Atenolol+hypertension,If not well medicated; I am always tachycardic. The medicine makes me hypotensive. I get super nervous when I go to the doctor too. So; it seems like empty words when I complain that the meds make me dizzy hypotensive. They take my bp at the doctor when I'm so nervous I could cry.. or throw up... or both. At the doctor; sometimes it is as high as 110/60; so it isn't at worrisome numbers. I doubt it will ever be 80/30 while I am at the doctor; but in my day to day life; it is problematic. I generally run 90/50 almost all the time anymore on all these meds. So; when it gets much lower; I can get to feeling yucky.

Because of my hypertension; I had begun a weight reduction program and have lost 35 lbs. Only a month ago I was diagnosed with CHF and this last week I decompensated requiring a hospital stay. My cardiologist suggested either a heart cath or a nuclear stress test to determine the cause of my angina; thus perhaps giving us a reason for the CHF as well. Unfortunately; I weigh about 380 lbs. and the X-ray tables cannot support weight that high. So my cardiologist decided to try to regulate my symptoms with medication. For several reasons I am in the process of looking for a new cardiologist in my area and want to be well informed when I first see him/her. Are there other tests or procedures available that could determine the cause of my angina other than the ones mentioned? I have had an echocardiogram which showed no enlargement of the heart; several ECGs showing tachycardia and some right-sided cardiac stiffness. Any other options I can discuss and/or try? Or am I stuck so to speak until my weight comes down another 80 lbs. or so--which might take a while? Thanks in advance for your advice. By the way; my meds for angina include a beta-blocker (atenolol) and isosorbide dinatol (spell?).

870,Atenolol+hypertension,Three weeks ago I had ablation for AV node reentry; and two other sites as well for atrial tachy and extrabeats. Ep said he got it all. Two weeks ago was put on a Loop monitor and my EP said he seen one atrial tachy 16 beats total and a number of sinus tachy; one up to 120bpm and a number of pac's. Well;last nite around 3am I was awakened from a sound sleep with the worst attach ever;even before ablation. I recorded and sent it in. It was beating at 160bpm+ at times with a few missed beats and was unrelenting. They said it looked like Sinus Tachy. The center told me to call my hospital which I did. The doc asked what I had on hand to take. I had an 80mg fast act Verapamil and 240sr Verapamil. I took the 80 and it slowed the heart rate down to the high 80's. Then took the 240mg. My HB is around 75 this am but it took 1 1/2 hours to get there. This no longer sounds like a normal variant of ablation does it? Also; I am to go on 50 mg Toprol 1xday after speaking with EP's office this am. and was told I could take the fast acting verapamil if it got untolerable as well as the Toprol. Can I mix Toprol with Verapamil? I took pinadole (spelling)one time prior to alation and it made my heart beat fast so was told to quit. Will the Toprol work better?

871,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; Thank you for taking my questions and for providing this very valuable service. I am a woman who turned 49 years old yesterday. I have a ten year history of panic and GAD that waxes and wanes. Cardiac symptoms; such as tachycardia and ""skipped"" beats occur when it's high. I have had two echocardiograms; the first showed MVP(mild; but medicate for dental work); the second didn't. These were both performed several years ago. I had a normal holter monitor test last April. I did have some symptoms; but was told holter was ""normal."" I did not ask any specifics. I have been having increasing bouts of tachycardia and palpitations again. I am also struggling again with my anxiety and I'm in the middle of an awful perimenopause. I am sometimes anemic and have had problems in the past with low potassium. Lab values for each of these was normal last month when I had them retested. My questions for you are: 1. How much do changing hormones and anxiety-produced adrenaline factor in to periodic tachycardia and palpitations? 2. Is there any way I can tell if anxiety is precipitating the palps or if the palps are precipitating the anxiety? 3. Would more testing be in order and if so; which tests would be helpful? 4. Is it better to medicate for the anxiety or the cardiac symptoms? (I have had success in the past with klonopin and had no problems coming off. I have had terrible side effects with SSRI's and also with beta blockers. I am willing to give the beta blockers another chance if that is the best route to go.)

872,Atenolol+hypertension,What could be the causes of near bradycardia. Pulse rate is always around 58-62 when at rest ( watching TV at the computor etc). Even standing or slow walking seem to take the pulse to only around 70-75. The reason I ask is that I started to notice palpitations around the same time as the lowered heart rate. I have always had palpitations (PAC's and PVC's) but not in the large volume as now (almost 1000 a day;mostly PACs with few PVCs). For many years before I would only have them occassionaly when tired; stressed etc; now they are at a steady rate. I did start an extensive exercise/diet program ( no fads or drugs; just watching what I eat with lots of cardio) 4 months ago and lost over 30 lbs and was feeling better and stronger than I had in many years. Went to have it checked out and all tests came back within normal limits except for mild hypertension for which atenolol was prescribed in low dose. It seemed that this drug lowered my pulse rate even lower to around 50 and I felt like a slug. I'm 53; otherwise in good health; have stopped almost all exercise for fear that we are missing something of a larger scale but the slow heart rate continues as do the palpitations. Can you shed some light on what could have/is causing all this. I've heard all kinds of answers- stretched the heart because of weight lifting; noise reaching the hearts pacemaker;heart not as flexible due to age; adrenalin excess; etc. It came and stayed out of the blue; granted I now feel and think about it all the time and the anxiety might be a factor but can't be the catch all.

873,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you for this forum. It has been very informative. I will apologize in advance for the length of this; but I know how hard it is to get on and wanted to make sure you knew my whole story. I am a 38 year old female; overweight by about 30 pounds. In October; 1999; had a situation where I was awakened by my heart racing. It scared me; but I attributed it to too much caffeine that night and finally it subsided. (This was also a time when I began taking birth control after having been off of it for about 1 1/2 years). I had been told prior to that when I tried to give blood that my heart rate was too fast. GP said it was within normal range; 60-100 but suggested I lose weight. I also went off birth control at the end of December. On January 12; 2000; I went to the ER as I was working and felt my heart all of a sudden begin racing. They determined when I first went in that it was at 192bpm. It came down on it's own to 108 in about five minutes; however they still administered a calcium channel blocker to get it down further before releasing me. The Verapamil (120 or 160 mg?) didn't agree with me and my GP took me off of them. I had an EKG and Echo during that time which showed nothing. They were checking for MVP. On March 10; 2000 began racing again at about 140bpm. Went to GP and it went down to 70 bpm in about 20 minutes. He went ahead and sent me to cardiologist for consult; he said that it looked like PSVT; nothing life threatening. Put me on event monitor and gave me Lopressor 50 mg. to take it I had an event and it didn't convert withing 30 minutes or so. He said that I could go to electrophysiologist to look at options; medicine or ablation. I had an event which I was able to record about two weeks ago; event monitor showed 170bpm. I took Lopressor which convered it to 70's range in about 20 minutes. EKG which was taken at hospital during this event showed the following: Vent. rate: 142bpm; PR interval 152ms; QRS duration 88ms; QT/QTc 264/406ms; P-R-T axes 265 97 -45. My questions are (any that you can answer): What is going on with me? Is it dangerous? I would like to not be on medicine if possible. In my situation; is catheter ablation a consideration?

874,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; I,2005,2006,,,dear doctor i
875,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Raymond on March 17; 1999 at 22:20:28: In Reply to: Re: Tremors and other odd occurences posted by CCF neuro MD MM on March 10; 1999 at 09:40:32: I hope this post does not appear to long winded. However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of ""attack"" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor. I feel there is some underlying cause; but they both have said that my episode has nothing to do with the tremor. but why did it become evident only after my other problems. I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor. A less selective drug like Propanolol-(Inderal)would have a chance of helping both problems simultaneously. Hi I visited my Neurologist today 3/16/99 and during our conversation I brought up Propanolol as an alternative to the antenolol. He feeling was that one was as effective as the other in treating E.T.; He also left it up to me to decide if I wanted to switch Beta blockers. As such I have a three fold question for you; 1)What if any is the significant difference between Atenolol and Propanolol in treating E.T.; 2) Are there any definitive tests (ways) to diagnose E.T. (or is it left up to the doctors experience only); and 3) Are there any other illnesses that could possibly present themselves as E.T. Whe I first had my episode the internist tested for pheochromocytoma; but when all test came back negative he decided it was E.T. Thanks for your time and energy.

876,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run. What's going on? Both my Stress Tests and my echo-stress were negative (I ran on the treadmill for a long time-the doctor said no restrictions) SO why is this happening? Should I have a Thallium Stress test to make sure my arteries are O.K? I also heard there was a high-speed CAT scan that shows plaque in the arteries.

878,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 26 year old male; and have had 2 EKG's in the past 3 months. One said I had Sinus Tachycardia; and the other one said Supraventricular. I have to pass a Holter but the waiting list is long ( will get it Oct.14 2008 ) but meanwhile my doctor told me to take Metoprolol because my tachycradia is almost 24/7 (with some exceptions; like at night most often) but runs around 120-170 bpm about all day. This caused me lately to be very exhausted and constantly fatigued; and having trouble excercising. It also generated ALOT of anxiety in me. So; today I took my first dose; I'm prescribed 2 pills a day of 25 mg. I started with halves though because I was scared my heart would drop TOO low; or my blood pressure too low; because I'm not taking this for hypertension. What concerns me; alot I must say; is some things I read about it. Like I do feel light-headed; dizziness and such; but I'm aware that they may be short-term side-effects (or are they?). What startled me tonight was I felt colder (like chills); and my hands felt slightly cold. I read on wikipedia that ""It may also reduce blood flow to the hands and feet; causing them to feel numb and cold""... but can this be dangerous? I mean; isn't blood flow important; and also; can it just be temporary? Another thing that alarmed me was here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker#Side_Effects_.2F_Health_Consequences Under Health Consequences; it includes stuff like ""Impaired Circulation"" and ""Heart Failure""; and it does not say ""Possible Health Consequences""... so are these things gonna happen without a doubt or are they just mere possibilities? And while I'm at it; are there alot of people who take Metoprolol and have no permanent problems but only beneficial results from this medication? Sorry if I'm bombarding with questions; I just found some sources kind of scary; and also my symptoms which I feared might be long-term so that's why I was wondering if they could wither away.

880,Atenolol+hypertension,I am having some bizarre symptoms for about 5 weeks now. My dentist found elevated bp at a routine appointment; which I thought was strange; since I had a complete cardiological workup in January (echocardiogram; holter monitor; 24 hr monitor; ekg; stress/echo test; blood work; carotid doppler) and a ct scan and u/s of the abdomen and pelvis. The only thing showing up on the ct was diverticulosis which i've had for years. I have also had gallstones since 1995 when I was pregnant; and they really never bothered me. Over the past 5 weeks; my bp stayed elevated and was getting worse. I have been petrified of taking bp meds because of side effects. I have multiple drug allergies and an allergy to dyes (I had a tumor in my submandibular gland in 1990 (where I had an anaphylaxis reaction to the cat scan dye) & a melanoma in my fingernail in 1992). I have had anaphylaxis reactions to pencillin and sulfa drugs and some other really bad reactions to other drugs. I didn't do well under general anesthesia when I had my tumor taken out in 1990; so I am petrified of being put out or even having a cocktail of drugs (i.e. propophol & versed for a colonoscopy so I won't have one; if I need to do it; I'll probably do a virtual). Having refused the diovan hct my cardiologist's partner prescribed (I researched it and found out there was sulfa in the hct so I wasn't able to take it); I just kept pressing for more tests when my cardiologist came back; since my gut was that my high blood pressure could be secondary to something else going on. I did go to the ER (before my dr came back) when my bp reached 175/98; and i asked for some basic blood work just to see if there was an infection somewhere in my body; but nothing showed up and they; too; said take diovan. I refused. I had more extensive blood work when my cardiologist came back; and I had elevated aldosterone; but not renin; and high cholesterol (216) and ldl (142). Before the blood work came back; I had a renal doppler sonogram; and it showed there was a blocked artery to my left kidney. I saw the dr who read it; and he was perplexed because my symptoms were atypical for this except for the hypertension (my kidney was not small or shrunken; and the blockage was not typically where one would be). He said he could have made a mistake in reading it (I appreciated his honesty); and he didn't want to do an angiogram (due to my dye allergy) or angioplasty (heaven forbid!) until he knew for sure it was renal artery stenosis; so he ordered an MRI with gadolinium (which although there is not supposed to be a reaction to it - Bayer could not guarantee it - but they did say to make sure there was no kidney disease first - my egfr and creatinine were normal so they said it should be fine). However; my bp is now up to 170-185 at night over a diastolic of anywhere from 98-120). When I get up in the morning it can be as high as 170 as well. It is so frightening. The original med (diovan) was contraindicated for renal hypertension so I was glad I stood my ground and never took it. I do feel there is a missing component to all this. About 4 weeks ago; once I heard about the hypertension issues; I was petrified; and I immediately started to clean up my diet and exercise. I gave up green tea; and coffee (which I rarely drank) and just have been drinking alkaline water. Within 10 days; I lost close to 14 pounds (which I've been dying to do for the past few years but was unable to). I've been doing fresh squeezed veggie juice on occasion; lots of fruit; veggies; nonfat yogurt and minimal protein. I was taking a lot of vitamins; omega 3 fish oils and probiotics and my stools were formed and dark due to the vitamins (I stopped a lot of this in fear that anything I was previously doing might be causing the hypertension). Two weeks into the diet cleanup (up to then my bm's were still okay); while I went to pick my daughter up from camp; I noticed a complete change in my bowels. I was at the hotel; and suddenly I wasn't forming a solid stool. I had only eaten fish; and some broccoli. The small cluster of feces was beige and looked like dog kibble (round little pellets all together in a round ball - you could see the individual pellets). It scared me; and of course my bp was elevated that entire weekend. Since then; I've been eating; still losing weight; have no stomach pain (except for some soreness to the right of my belly button which has been there about 4-5 years) and still no bm. I walk about 45-60 minutes every other day; and I really don't feel bloated or feel like I have an urge to go to the bathroom. My stomach is as flat as its ever been and not swollen or bloated. I began getting worried about not going to the bathroom; and so I took some large doses of vitamin C to try and go; and all that came out was mostly water and very little broken up feces. I urinate frequently (always have). I kept eating; lost more weight; and had 2 little dark strips come out and felt it was an incomplete evacuation. Yesterday; I took some prune juice at night; and more water and broken up black pieces of feces within the water came out (I could also see some pieces of granola in there as I've eaten lots of fiber - allbran; granola; ground flaxseeds and oat bran which didn't produce any bm). I asked the cardiologist and vascular surgeon if there could be any relation between the potential renal artery stenosis and this constipation problem. I told them I hadn't gone in 2 weeks; and they didn't think it was related. Tonight I had 2 little strips come out that were tan; and that really panicked me. I took more prune juice and again all that came out was water and some orange colored broken up minimal feces (I had eaten an omelet this morning with tomatoes and artichokes and chili peppers; cayenne and tumeric which would account for the orange color). That is what scared me; because usually chili peppers cause me to go to the bathroom easily. Should I go to the ER to see if I have an intestinal blockage? Could this all be from the change in diet? Would the best diagnostic test for now be xray or ct scan? I don't have an internist right now; so I would have to find someone to evaluate me asap. I am supposed to have the MRI with gadolinium next Tuesday; August 18th and now I'm scared of doing that in case there is some blockage in my intestines which might interfere with the test. It's so stressful and confusing; and I just feel it all might be related and causing the hypertension. One last thing; I had a fibroadenoma in my breast last January as well; and they used an ultrasound needle biopsy and then inserted a titanium clip in my breast. I mentioned it to my gynecologist as perhaps a possibility for all these problems; but she said titanium is usually very safe.

883,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 39-year-old female who has had episodes of chest pain; abdominal pain; and shortness of breath since 2000. I have a history of seronegative RA and am currently being worked up for dermatomyositis due to myopathic changes in the upper extremities on EMG. I also have been treated for Lyme Disease. I have a complicated history and it is hard for me to know what is ""important"". My paternal grandfather died of a massive coronary and my maternal grandmother has severe hypertension. Otherwise; I am unsure of any family history of heart disease. I have been seen in the ER many times for chest and abdominal pain and have had several ""borderline"" and ""abnormal"" EKG's. In 2000; it was ""sinus tachycardia and left atrial enlargement"". In 2001; it was ""normal sinus rhythm/right atrial enlargement/nonspecific ST abnormality"". I had several episodes of chest pain and was given nitro to take which did help. (I was also on Vioxx at this time and had intermittent high blood pressure and after stopping Vioxx in 2004; my symptoms improved quite a lot. ) I was referred for a stress test and a gated perfusion study which was WNL at 54%. I have no details on the findings of the stress test portion. I was referred to cardiology (this was all at a military hospital) and started on Atenolol with a diagnosis of ""palpitations and tachycardia"". I had a Holter monitor which was interpreted as invalid because one lead was not on right or something. My doctor moved and I was told that follow up was not necessary. I stopped the Atenolol and just went on with life. Later that same year I was treated in the ER for severe abdominal pain after eating. I had pelvic phleboliths and it was assumed that it was a kidney stone. I never passed a stone; but did assume this was correct due to hematuria and a UTI shortly thereafter. I have continued to have intermittent chest pain; sharp transient abdominal pain; and shortness of breath. EKG in 2002 showed ""normal sinus rhythm"". EKG in 2005 prior to knee surgery showed ""arrhythmia/ ST depression/nonspecific ST changes"". I was not even aware of this until recently. Dizziness started in December 2006 and continues intermittently. As part of my workup for dermatomyositis; I underwent CT scan of the chest; abdomen; and pelvis. This showed atheroslerosis. My question is could the atherosclerosis cause the symptoms I have been experiencing? I continue with intermittent chest and abdominal pain (always after eating but not all the time) ulcer workups have been negative and I have stopped all anti-inflammatories; shortness of breath; and dizziness. I also notice that when I am angry; stressed; or exercise intensely I become more symptomatic. So what is the proper workup for me at this point? Should I see a cardiologist?

884,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have been taking a beta blocker; 50 mg Metoprolol ER (Extended/Slow Release); for several years but have with my cardiologist approval today refilled my BB prescription with Metoprolol Tartrate (normal release) to be taken at 25 mg twice a day (every 12 hours). My reason is driven mainly by the fact the Tartrate is about 1/6th the cost of the Suc (ER). That said; I wonder if I will not in fact have a more ""level"" medication concentration taking the 25 mg twice rather than the 50 mg ER once a day. I think there is a good possibility that I'll have a more uniform medication concentration (on average) taking the Tartrate twice a day. Or; I have my doubts about how well a ER holds up over 24 hours. I doubt that I'll have anything to report; i.e.; there will not be any change in my symptoms that I can detect. So this post is more a question/discussion point. It seems I have the same opportunity to save money on my CCB by taking a normal release at half the dose twice a day.

885,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was recently dx with Mild LVH. I have had mildly elevated BP in the past; but now it is under control; usually ranging 112-114/74-78. I currently take Propranolol for the BP and it seems to be working well. My question is; when I went for the test results my Dr. did not seem like the LVH was a big deal and the cardiologist that performed my 2 day stress test did not say that I needed to returm to him for further care. The stress test was neg. for any other problems. Is mild LVH no big deal; could I ""keel"" over from this? I am thinking that if my Dr. does not seem to cencerned of it; then why should I? I trust my Dr. very much; but after all; it is my ticker we're dealing with here.He just says that I need to keep my BP controlled; and that there are studies that indicate the LVH could regress.

886,Atenolol+hypertension,After telling my new Dr. about my family history of heart disease and explaining an incident a few years ago where I had chest pains; I was instructed to have an EKG and an echocardiogram. My EKG was normal and although my echo stated no valvular heart disease it stated I had mild mitral regurgitation and a trace of tricuspid regurgitation. After reseaching on the internet I do better understand what this means. But my main question is this; I am young; 25 years old; and wanting to know if mild matral regurgitation is something that usually gets worse with time or if even in my 50's; or 60's I still have a good chance of it being mild? My father; along with a few others in my family; had a heart arrythmia and atherosclorosis. And my father passed away from cardiac arrest at the age of 52; so I'm sure you can see my concern. I wasn't able to find in my research how often; or what % of people who have mild mitral regurgitation end up with moderate or severe regurgitation. Any insight you can give is greatly appreciated.

889,Atenolol+hypertension,Good Morning and Thanks for taking my questions. I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the interventricular septum; 14 mm nearly one year ago; 4 years prior to that is was 12 mm; same equipment; same cardio. I worry about HCM; though no family history whatsoever; long livers on both sides; average probably about 88 years; though a few have lived to 98/99.I have a connective tissue disease AS. Is it possible that my CTD could actually be responsible for the mild LVH; rather than mild HTN? I consider my HTN very controlled ; it's probably been averaging around 115/75 the last few years. I've also been diagnosed with costochondritis and FM secondary to my CTD; Could these have any link or be contributing factors for my intermittant palpitations (PVCs & tachycardia)? These are also very controlled with atenolol and losartan. I have an history of life long epsiodes of tachycardia & PVCs and rapid heartrates.I do have anxiety issues which doesn't help. I have a very slight intermittant delta wave is lead ll on my ECG ; barely noticable; normal on computer printout and cardio assessment but I've been told I don't have WPW; any opinions or thoughts? Are intermittent delta waves common without a diagnosis of WPW? My last echo was done in July 2005; I was told by my cardio to have another in 2 years; Do you think with the info provided that this is a reasonable time or I should have one earlier? I'm a bit worried about HCM; but I've been assured by my cardio I don't have that.

891,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been taking Xanax and/or Klonopin off and on since November 2005. I am physically addicted to the stuff and wish to get off of all benzos; period. Problem is; I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS); a type of autonomic nervous system dysfunction that causes my body to produce too much adrenalin; which makes my anxiety worse. The benzos helped both my anxiety and my POTS in the beginning; but now they do nothing; the only reason I take them is to keep myself from withdrawing. I keep on needing to go higher and higher in order to get the desired effect; and I am now on Xanax 2mg per day. I don't take Klonopin anymore because it doesn't help my anxiety like the Xanax; and it made my heart race (up to 108 bpm) on several occasions. I have to get off of the Xanax now; but its half-life is so short that it's virtually impossible. Trying to lower the dosage aggravates my condition; causing my heart to beat even faster and making my PVC's worse. What should I do in order to get off of this stuff? P.S. I also take Atenolol 50mg (a beta blocker) and Lexapro 5mg (an SSRI) which really help to keep my condition under control.

892,Atenolol+hypertension,"Twice in the past month I had to go to my local Urgent Care clinic for sudden cardiac symptoms. I think I received inappropriate triage and I and considering sending a letter to the medical director of the clinic. I would like the opinion of someone in the medical field to review my concerns and help me determine if my perception is valid. My only intent on sending the letter is to inform the director and that hopefully the staff will receive some training. On the first occasion; I experienced a sudden tachycardia with exertion that was not relieved by rest. My heart rate was 150. When I checked in and told the receptionist my symptoms; I was not questioned further about other symptoms other than ""are you light-headed;"" which I was earlier but had improved on the ride to the clinic. That was the only question I was asked. I was told to have a seat and wait my turn. It turns out that I was having a sudden hypertensive episode (196/126). I have no other history of hypertension. I had a normal EKG and some lab work; and my BP was down to about 150/95 when I went home. I saw my own doc 2 days later and was prescribed an event monitor for 30 days. 3 weeks later (and with normal blood pressure during these 3 weeks) I experienced an afternoon of very frequent palpitations; and a sudden increase of blood pressure at home of 190/110 (in the interim I bought a BP cuff for use at home). I went back to the same Urgent Care; told the receptionist I was wearing a heart monitor; that I had increased palpitations; and that my blood pressure was suddenly increased to 190/110. I was not questioned further and was told to have a seat and wait my turn. I saw my own doc the next day. I am now on atenolol and awaiting lab results on a 24 hr. urine for metanephrines. So; again; my question is; am I correct in my perception of having received inappropriate triage; and should I write my letter to the medical director?

893,Atenolol+hypertension,I was discharged this afternoon from a local large hospital's cardiac care unit. There was some disagreement between a couple of doctors as to the significance of these rhythms. I understand that a PVC by itself is nothing; and even a short term Bigeminal or Triplet series is nothing to write home about. However; I was admitted 2 days ago; after a multi-hour stay in another small hospital's ER while they monitored a very long non-stop series of these beats. I was eventually transferred to an unfamiliar hospital's care. During the hour-long ambulance ride; these same arrythmias continuously occurred... sufficient to raise the eyebrows of the EMTs and the receiving hospital's ER team on my way to the ccu. I should add here that I have a history of hypertension; high cholesterol; and a typical rhythm of sinus bradycardia. I am trim; in my 40s; male; and have a family history of heart disease and hyperlipidemia (among other things...). I am currently on Toprol XL; but I don't know if that is best for this situation. I have been researching this issue and there seems to be a lot of contradictory information. The doctors themselves seemed to diagree with one another. One cardiologist said that these rhythms in my case are significant; and another from the same group said that they were not significant; that the heart is healthy and forget I was even told these results in multiple facilities by different professionals. The doctor who seemed to think that the condition should be treated was talking about medication and if that does not work then possibly an ICD. The other doctor wouldn't even talk about the rhythms saying that they were normal. I was given nitro after a stress-test today; and this seemed to control the beats for about 3 hours. Then they slowly started again. Now; I am not ignorant about my health and my heart. I know what is normal; and this was definitely NOT normal. I would not have bothered going to an ER over one or two PVCs. This was hour-long+ periods accompanied by shortness of breath and some pressure and mild pain. Unfortunately; the physician who ordered my transfer to his hospital is the one who doesn't think there is a problem (he viewed the ER ecg and other tests before he authorized the transfer). He was also the one who discharged me three hours ago. I spent 2 days in hospitals only to walk away with a very big question. What should I do next? I am not interested in playing doctor against doctor. All I want to know is which one was more likely to be right so I can pursue that course of action. Some information on the net supports both opinions! It is hard to decide what to do. If I do choose to ignore this problem; are there any warning signs that I should look for with these multiple pvcs that should not be ignored? My usual warning signs are already there... chest discomfort; shortness of breath; palps; etc. If I do not ignore the problem and seek treatment; is it likely that the medication and/or ICD can shorten my life-expectancy as some doctors (on the net) claim. Now; only after 3 hours following discharge; I have spent two hours of them same arrythmias and some tachycardia. Not only do they not seem normal; they are annoying!

894,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; my name is Nicole. On friday 12/05 ; when I was at work I became slightly lightheaded and my heart was beating higher then normal. This experience precipitated what I believe to be a panic attack. My heart was racing; flushed; sweating; waves of terror; etc. However this feeling of a racing heart did not go away and the next afternoon I had my boyfriend take me to the ER because I still felt like my heart was pounding. On the EKG they gave me my HR was 117 BPM; the PR interval was 179 ms; the QRS duration was 71 ms and the QT was 308 ms and the QTc was 430 ms. I am wondering if all of these numbers are normal. The doctors were specifically looking for Wolff-Parkinson's-White because my father had this; so I am wondering if they overlooked anything. I definitely do not have WPW; as this is the third time I've been checked since I was a child. They said I was dehydrated. After this trip the feeling of a racing heart continued and on wednesday night I ended up in the ER again because of tetany ( apparently hyperventilation-induced) while I was driving. I don't mean to sound like a hypochondriac; but it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. SO after all of this the feeling of the racing heart has gone down to somewhat normal. I am just wondering if all these things could be produced by anxiety; and if my ekg numbers are normal; especially the QT and Qtc numbers. My general practitioner gave me a prescription for Inderal LA 60 mg and xanax; but before I start taking them regularly I would just like a second opinion.,2008,2008,20.0,Female,hi name nicol on friday 1205 i work i becam slight lighthead heart beat higher normal this experi precipit i believ panic attack my heart race flush sweat wave terror etc howev feel race heart go away next afternoon i boyfriend take er i still felt like heart pound on ekg gave hr 117 bpm pr interv 179 ms qrs durat 71 ms qt 308 ms qtc 430 ms i wonder number normal the doctor specif look wolffparkinsonswhit father i wonder overlook anyth i definit wpw third time ive check sinc i child they said i dehydr after trip feel race heart continu wednesday night i end er tetani appar hyperventilationinduc i drive i dont mean sound like hypochondriac scariest thing ever happen so feel race heart gone somewhat normal i wonder thing could produc anxieti ekg number normal especi qt qtc number my general practition gave prescript inder la 60 mg xanax i start take regular i would like second opinion
895,Atenolol+hypertension,This is; regarding the case of my father in law who is suffering from liposarcoma . A brief case summary; is given below:- My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram; kerla ;India followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumor in his left thigh which was also reamoved next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Only 90% of it could be removed as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.) The pathology report for the thigh tumor and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type ?). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumor is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumor is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumors related to the liposaroma; we took him to Bangalore Instt of Oncology to examine whether Cyber Knife treatment could be of any use. As suggested by them a PET SCAN and DOTATATE test was conducted and the report obtained states that neither CK nor dotattate is possible in his case. I would really appreciate your expert opinion on what further line of treatment is best suited for him which will prolong his life without compromising the quality of life much. 1. Is surgery an option in the given situation ? (followed by Cyber Knife/ chemo) 2.Whether normal radiation method will give him some relief? 3. Are there any other better options we can adopt ? .

Here is a little more information from my physician. Does the following make any difference to your comments. 16 March bilateral visual cortex infarction; leading to a superior altitudinal field defect; which has persisted; on a background of poorly controlled hypertension; a non-functioning left kidney with a previous partial left nephrectomy and possible impaired right renal function. She has a strongly positive ANA of uncertain significance. On May 14th a left vertebral stenosis was stented. There has been no further neurological deficit since presentation. Her blod pressure is now under good control. Currently; she is on Atenolol 50mg once a day; soluble aspirin 75mg once a day; Simvastatin 20mg once a day and Dipyridamole 100mg tds On examination 30June 1998 her visual acuity was 6/6 corrected in the right eye and 6/12 corrected in the left with N6 bilaterally. She has what appeared to confrontation to be a complete superior altitudinal field defect bilaterally. She would not appear to fulfil the criteria which would enable her to contemplate driving. This is the doctor's report. I have made much progress since the CVA and driving is my last goal that I would love to achieve. Do you think there is any hope of my vision improving further. Any interesting research in this area? Many thanks again. Diana. ====================================================================== Thanks for your additional information. It is quite clear from your posting that there was a lesion to the visual cortex; which is situated in the posterior aspect of the brain. As a ""rule of thumb""; most neurological impairments that have not recovered at six months after the lesion onset will not present much significant improvement afterwards. Having said that; however; a great deal can be accomplished with Occupational Therapy techniques that teach patients to compensate for the existant deficits. Regarding your elegibility for driving; it is very much dependent on each state law; hence it is a question better posed to your neurologist or family physician. I hope this information is helpful.

897,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By ruth on December 22; 1998 at 18:35:11: I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have ""conventional"" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was ""ischemic."" I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore.

898,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello and thank you for reading my post in advance. I have been having a multitude of issues since I was young and it wasn't until lately that I've begun to suspect they may be more related than I thought. I am a 24 year old female who has had hypertension since I was a toddler. As soon as I was old enough; they put me on a alpha-blocker. Later; a beta-blocker was added but alpha blocker was stopped. I am still on atenolol 50 mg daily for this. I have heart palpitations regularly. Around June; I was not stressing and had no caffeinated beverages and while sitting in the middle of my college class I realized I was not breathing well. I then started to get shaky and assumed that I had to eat something as I have often had symptoms of low blood sugar throughout my life and I had not eaten much. When the room started to spin; I grabbed the granola bar in my backpack and went to the bathroom to eat it. By this point; I was feeling the racing and pounding of my heart and nausea was setting in. This was not the first heart episode I had like this. I had one at work before that traveled up my neck and into my head that coworkers could feel just by touching me and another where it seemed like a heart attack. I did not go to the hospital for the first two because I didn't have insurance at the time. This recent time I did because I now do through my college. They saw me at the college clinic right away but by the time I had enough gumption to walk over there I was just very weak and sick feeling. I went to the ER twice that weekend for similar symptoms in which one episode I collapsed and shook violently from cold. The ER made me WAIT hours to be seen in a waiting room with no supervision with this. I fell asleep in the room waiting for the doc and by the time he got there; well I wasn't having the episode. Now; you might be thinking; why isn't this in the cardiology forum? Well I also have had issues with menstruation my entire life. I am married and have been for five years without conceiving with no birth control. Doctors just told me I had PCOS without any testing. They put me on birth controls which drove my blood pressure up. I gave up until after this recent heart episode because that SAME weekend I started what is an ongoing menstruation that only paused yesterday. The OBGYN I saw recently just confirmed for me that I do not have PCOS and no growths in my reproductive tract. When my period restarted today; I had more episodes with my heart. I did see a cardiologist who ran some tests. He said my heart had an extra beat but one is not enough to worry about. He tried a stress test which failed because the drug did not raise my blood pressure enough. I have observed on my own that when I have these episodes; my blood pressure will rise to about 179/140 and drop very quickly. I did some research of my own and I've been reading about pituitary tumors. Some of the symptoms that I have had for years and did not connect seem like they could be related. I have had milky nipple discharge that doctors never seem worried about. I do have headaches behind one eye and have seen halos and what I can only describe as a center point in my vision that light seems to flow towards like ripples. I've never heard or found anything about the odd visual disturbances. I also have arthritic fingers and joints that a doctor told me at 16 I had a marker for rheumatoid arthritis for when I get older and sent me to some useless therapy. (I just live with it for now) and recently I have learned I have sleep apnea. (Been on treatment for about a month with no change to any symptoms) Blood sugar is perfect; btw. I feel that I am WAY too young to be having these problems and it's making me very depressed. I'm desperate to find an answer but doctors just want to treat symptoms. Does it sound like I have a pituitary tumor and if so; what kind of doctor do I need a referral to. (I need a referral for EVERY doctor I see that isn't at my school clinic) Would an endocrinologist be the one? I can't help but feel that at least the menstrual and cardiac problems might be linked.

899,Atenolol+hypertension,So today I went to a doctor (not a cardiologist) and showed my Holter results and he said I should take propanolol 10mg for a few months. According to him; I had 14% of the beats in tachycardia; which is too much. Well I tried to explain that I had a busy day when I used the Holter and I even exercised; and the average HR during the 24 hours exam was 81bpm; which in my opinion is not that big (but I'm not a doctor). The Holter caught only 3 PACs and 5 PVCs; but somedays I have a lot lot more; maybe 300-400. Do you think 14% of the time in tachycardia; even if there's no episode of tachycardia for more than a few minutes; is a reason to start taking beta blockers? Should I listen to a second opinion; from a cardiologist? I don't feel like I need to take it; my HR in the night is usually between 55 - 65 so it will likely drop to 40's.... Thanks for your opinions.,2014,2015,,Male,so today i went doctor cardiologist show holter result said i take propanolol 10mg month accord i 14 beat tachycardia much well i tri explain i busi day i use holter i even exercis averag hr 24 hour exam 81bpm opinion big im doctor the holter caught 3 pac 5 pvcs someday i lot lot mayb 300400 do think 14 time tachycardia even there episod tachycardia minut reason start take beta blocker should i listen second opinion cardiologist i dont feel like i need take hr night usual 55 65 like drop 40s thank opinion
900,Atenolol+hypertension,My blood pressure; until last year; was always around 90/60; last year it shot up to 234/198 and I had a three hour nose bleed that was stopped with a coagulate med shot when I was rushed to the hospital. From that point on it fluctuated for a month in the 119/90 area ... until I found a good hypertension Doctor who; after dozens of tests; got it under control with norvasc; it still runs around 140/76; so I have just now had the 5 mg increased to 10mg. I have had atrial Fib; ventrical tachicardia and mitral valve prolaspe for 35 years but was not caught until 10 years later; in the past 15 years it has been under control with atenolol and no more episodes for the past 7 years; just a slight amount of arrythmia once in a while. I; also; have just a very slight irregularity in my atrial heart valve. 4 yrs ago I had tremendous water retension and swelling of my leg after a hip replacement and gained 10 lbs over night. They thought I had heart failure but yearly echos have confirmed that I do not; the echos in 2008 showed I had a slight amount of atrial enlargement; Now; the echo I had yesterday shows my right and left atrial chambers are severly enlarged. I have had some angina pain but I think it is mostly from stress; since I had angina pain yesterday after I was told my heart was now severly enlarged. My weight is very normal; I have no shortness of breath; my endurance is quite good; however; I had to give up my walking 5 miles aday after my hip replacement. I have cooked only mediterranian diet food for 20 years. Is it possible that my blood pressure; even though not really high is causing the enlarged heart? Is it alot more dangerous to have an enlarged heart? Does the enlarged heart mean that I now will have more atrial fib; or other heart problems? Is it possible for me to get my heart size back to normal size and if so; how? What other tests can I take that will give me a guide line on the best things I can do for myself to maintain good heart health inspite of a few heart problems.

901,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've read through the archives and know that ""in general"" if there are no underlying conditions that PVCs are benign. I've had them since I was about 13 years old but only once or twice a year. Recentley they started coming (several a day)and some are quite painful;and sometimes I experience what feels like several in a row (10 or so). (I'm 39 now). I frequently experience chest tightness or discomfort before and/or after the PVCs; as well as a host of other symptoms. I had an Echo (15 years ago) which was normal. This year I've had a resting EKG; stress test; wore a Holter monitor and an event monitor. All showed PVCs but the cardiologist said I was fine. Since the ""multiple attacks"" I've been having a lot of trouble dealing with these. He said he thinks it does more harm than good to treat a benign condition with medications. I tend to agree; but even with a psycologist I can't seem to handle these things. The dang things are causing the stress; which causes more PVCs. I'm afraid to exercise and I have heard that PVCs can degrade into VF. I've asked my cardiologist; but he just tells me to see a pshycologist; so I hope that you all can answer these questions: 1. What factors turn PVCs into VFib and do the tests I have had (Stress test; holter and event - echo (10 to 15 years ago)show if I am at risk for this happening to me? 2. Dr. won't give meds and I don't drink; smoke; eat caffine or chocolate; Tha Chi for stress etc. so are there any ""natural"" remedies to help ease these things?

902,Atenolol+hypertension,Happy New Year; Last night had a very frightening experience; laying in bed had what I normally felt like a pvc; anyway my heart basically started to feel like it was quivering. I reach to take my pulse for a few seconds i couldn't find one; then despite this irregular quivering of my heartbeat; my pulse was regular at least fairly regular and had good volume. Is it possible it might have been a-fib with a fairly regular pulse or interpolated pvcs occuring without a pause? I know it would be impossible to know for sure without a ecg tracing or holter; only had this particular feeling about 8 years last about the same lenght of time about 5-10 minutes. I was really alarmed; my wife was shopping so I had to call my sister who lives next door over; she said I looked deathly pale ; though she claims she experineces the same feeling quite often. It went away quite quickly; I decided not to go to the ER unless it returned; thankfully so far it has not. I skipped my atenolol and cozaar last night; I have a feeling atenolol might be contributing to these episodes so I have decided to half my atenolol dose and see what happens. I take 100mg daily in divided doses. I suspect it could be the culprit; any thoughts? Medical history . have AS; a connective tissue disease. Heart evaluation echo; stess test and ecg. normal ; besides mild LVH. ECG and echo within the last 6 months ; stress test 4 years ago.mild hypertension (very controlled) Do this sound like it might have been V-tach or AIVR; pulse probably 80-90 bpm the whole time?

903,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By Gillon on July 09; 1999 at 14:12:13 I have been having irregular heartbeats for the last four years. The first occurred when I was ending a relationship. I was walking and felt my heart beating irregularly and had to sit on the sidewalk. This went on for several minutes before it began beating normally; though I was experiencing Tachacardia. I went to the emergency room and the ECG was normal. They said this was due to stress and I should just relax.I was 29 then and am now 33 and have had endless tests (ECG's;Stress tests;Stress echos;MRI of chest) all negative. The only abnormalities found were slight thickening of the mitral valves (but closed o.k-no MVP) and slight mitral regurgitation.I have seen three very good cardiologists and 1 EP Specialist and they agree my condition is mostly due to Panic Disorder. My blood pressure sometimes soars at unexpected moments; and I experience unexplained chest pain at rest and a few times while exercising (this scares me!) I have had Halter monitors and portable heart cards to try and capture my arrythmias; but so far have only recorded tachacardia and one short arrythmia followed by a run. I want to believe the doctors; but have a hard time differentiating between panic and a real heart problem! I am presently on 50mg Atenolol and .5 mg Klonopin a day and still get skipped beats almost daily. The other day I was jogging and had a sharp fast chest pain at the end of a 2 mile run. What's going on? Both my Stress Tests and my echo-stress were negative (I ran on the treadmill for a long time-the doctor said no restrictions) SO why is this happening? Should I have a Thallium Stress test to make sure my arteries are O.K? I also heard there was a high-speed CAT scan that shows plaque in the arteries. I don't think I want to do an Angiogram at this stage. Please help me; I need some good advice.

908,Atenolol+hypertension,Hell; I hope you are doing well. I am having a problem where I have episodes of severe pain on my left side of my chest. I am 29 YO male and My Doctor says it is chosto chondritis. He has giving me some Celebrex and Vicadin. Neither work. When I feel this pain; (at night when I am trying to go to sleep) It always worries me and I get anxious. It will not go away until it is time for me to go to work the next day. (so I stay up these nights). It is a constant pain over the left chest area sometimes high in the chest and sometimes low. I have had light headed spells that will last all day. And on 2 occassions my left leg has went numb. On 1 ocassion I went to the Er; CAT a cat sckan and EKG showed nothing. I have had blood work done and nothing. My mom was diagnosed at 29 with Leukemia. I remember her telling us after she would go to the docter; before she was diagnosed; that he said it was not her heart. This always hits at night. Usually late and sometimes wakes me up. Everything is going great; money; family; job. Nothing really to be stressed about except the Cowboys and Stars keep losing. What does this sound like to you. I know you can not diagnose me but any advice/suggestions. The pain is pretty intense and usually lasts about 6 hours.,2001,2001,,,hell i hope well i problem i episod sever pain left side chest i 29 yo male my doctor say chosto chondriti he give celebrex vicadin neither work when i feel pain night i tri go sleep it alway worri i get anxious it go away time go work next day i stay night it constant pain left chest area sometim high chest sometim low i light head spell last day and 2 occass left leg went numb on 1 ocass i went er cat cat sckan ekg show noth i blood work done noth my mom diagnos 29 leukemia i rememb tell us would go docter diagnos said heart this alway hit night usual late sometim wake everyth go great money famili job noth realli stress except cowboy star keep lose what sound like i know diagnos advicesuggest the pain pretti intens usual last 6 hour
909,Atenolol+hypertension,I recently began having pvc's several times an hour and was started on atenolol 50 mg after being diagnosed with hypertension also. 150's/90's. Now have very few pvc's and B/P 120's/80's. However an echo for checking cause of pvc's revealed mitral valve prolapse with redundacy of posterior leaflet and a moderate mitral regurgitation; trivial tricuspid and trivial pulmonary valve regurgitation. Have had chest pain at times over past 2 years and episodes of shortness of breath with exertion; but not always. Will be having a stress echo next week. If stress echo is normal; what should I expect for follow-up of regurgitation and what is the probability that it will not get worse? 41 y.o. non-smoker; Thank you so much for any info.,2002,2002,,,i recent began pvcs sever time hour start atenolol 50 mg diagnos hypertens also 150s90s now pvcs bp 120s80s howev echo check caus pvcs reveal mitral valv prolaps redundaci posterior leaflet moder mitral regurgit trivial tricuspid trivial pulmonari valv regurgit have chest pain time past 2 year episod short breath exert alway will stress echo next week if stress echo normal i expect followup regurgit probabl get wors 41 yo nonsmok thank much info
910,Atenolol+hypertension,I have been having heart palps on and off for two years. I am a 26 yr old woman and perfectly healthy. About a year ago I had a series of tests(EKG; holter monitor;event monitor;echocardiogram)and have seen both and an M.D. and cardiologist. Tests showed PVC's;PAC's; and atrial runs. None of the Drs seemed too concerned. Through my own research and keeping a time line on a calendar I have assumed that they were related to hormones. I usually get them on and off for about a week(sometimes pretty big ones-several times a day) and then nothing for anywhere from 3 wks to 8 mos but they always end up coming back eventually! I have gotten off birth control;do not drink ANY caffine; am not overweight; and am not stressed(except when I have them).After I got off the pill I did not have any for about 8 mos and then last month they started up again w/my period and then left at the end of my cycle(however; they are not always during my perod). I don't want anything to be wrong but I am tired of being worried about this. Do you have any advice about this? Have you heard of heart palps being related to hormones is women?

911,Atenolol+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)? Don’t statins have dangerous side-effects? What should be the proper treatment regimen? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And aren’t blood thinners possibly contra-indicated by her history? Could her reduction in pain on the shoulder cause by the anti-inflammatory effect of the statin ?

912,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question. I am a bit confused as to what most cardiologist consider a normal ejection fraction; I have seen conflicting numbers though the difference being very small. I have seen 50-70% as normal ; then 55-75% as normal. What numbers or % do CCF use? Would you consider an EF of 50% and over normal? The reason I ask my last echo 2 months ago on the printout it showed an Ef of 53%; yet in the doctors office he said my EF was actually 55-60%; when I received a copy of the echo report it said 53%; I called and asked him about the difference in the printout and what he told me; he said my Ef was what he told me 55-60% and the number on the printout was of no significance; that I had no signs of cardiomyopathy. Even if my Ef 53% ; would you still consider that normal? From what i gather most centers and cardiologist consider 50% and above normal; though I seen guidelines with the low being 55%; this is confusing;I just some clarification. My EF 5 years was 65-70%; I understand it can vary; he told me that time I was more nervous and that my heart was a bit hyperkinetic then; Would you agree that increased anxiety with your heart punding harder ; even if no that much faster can increase your EF?

913,Atenolol+hypertension,I have posted before in this forum and also want to thank the doctors and other people who are so informative and supportive. My question is this. I don't drink alcohol often but when I do I tend to drink to much. Friday within a period of the evening from 7:00 P.M. to 3:00 P.M. I consumed 3 bottles of white wine. Of course I did not feel well the next day. But; Sunday and Monday I felt pain with nausea all day. I was wondering if maybe the dehydration had something to do with increasing PVC's and nausea. I have also had nausea alot when I haven't drank alcohol too. I just had a 30 day event monitor and it had runs of trigeminy; alot of PVC's and sinus tachycardia. I had alot on holter 18;000 in 24 hours. They are getting much more painful now and the doctor also has be on .05 xanax for night. I have also been experiencing alot of joint pain in back and knees. Could the drugs be causing this. I think I have asked this before but I don't think I got an answer. When you have this many episodes does it cause you to be tired and lethargic or would that be side effects from meds. I am also on hyzarr(50 ml) a day for blood pressure. I am a 45 year old white female with full hysterectomy fours years ago. I am not on any hormone replacement. But; I have had every test known to man for my heart and seems like everything is fine. I am about 30 lbs overweight though. When wearing 30 day event it would jump from 85; 145; 240 and back to 71. Is this from PVC's??? I know this is alot to comment but I would really appreciate your imput. Maybe another EP study?,2003,2003,44.0,Female,i post forum also want thank doctor peopl inform support my question i dont drink alcohol often i i tend drink much friday within period even 700 pm 300 pm i consum 3 bottl white wine of cours i feel well next day but sunday monday i felt pain nausea day i wonder mayb dehydr someth increas pvcs nausea i also nausea alot i havent drank alcohol i 30 day event monitor run trigemini alot pvcs sinus tachycardia i alot holter 18000 24 hour they get much pain doctor also 05 xanax night i also experienc alot joint pain back knee could drug caus i think i ask i dont think i got answer when mani episod caus tire letharg would side effect med i also hyzarr50 ml day blood pressur i 45 year old white femal full hysterectomi four year ago i hormon replac but i everi test known man heart seem like everyth fine i 30 lbs overweight though when wear 30 day event would jump 85 145 240 back 71 is pvcs i know alot comment i would realli appreci imput mayb anoth ep studi

915,Atenolol+hypertension,"6 weeks ago I went to the ER with Chest Discomfort; BP Was high (240/120). Labs; X-Ray; EKG normal. Background 35 yr old male. Borderline hypertension most of the time.; LDL 150; total 230. Non-smoker. About 20 lbs overweight; exercise regularly. I'm still getting chest pains; mainly shooting in nature; bi-lateral; but occasionally dead center and it's pressure. 1. They did a nuclear stress echo with exercise; said everything looked normal. EF 60%. How often do false negatives show up? 2. I'm belching constantly. Many times it relieves the dead center chest pain. However the upper chest shooting pains come and go. Should this belching help ease my mind this is not caridac? 3. Lately I ""feel"" like my heart is fluttering sometimes. I've gotten lightheaded a few times; however I do acknowledge that the ER trip and these pains have my anxiety through the roof. My internist wants me to get an upper GI scope; mentioned this could be my esophogus. I've been on prilosec for 6 weeks with little change though; might even be worse. Is the upper GI scope the next logical step? 4. Should I push for a cardiology consult? My understanding is that angina or MI pains are not shooting in nature(most of mine are under 5 seconds) with the exception of a few times I had this center chest pain. I've already had an exercise stress with nuclear done that was clean. The next steps would be an echo; or cath correct? Would any cardiologist realisically do either with my symptoms? 5.

916,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed 10 years ago with mitral valve prolapse. I awoke one night shortly after the birth of my third child with symptoms suggestive of a heart attack. I went to the ER and was told everything was okay. I consulted with a cardiologist and was told I had MVP. I was put on medication. The history after that with this problem was that I was on and off medication due to side effects. I would have symptoms of rapid heart beating and put on medication for that. I saw manycardiologists and doctors over the years. Some would say on the basis of listening that I definitely DID NOT have MVP. Some would say I did. I continued to take SBE prophylaxis over that entire time as a safeguard. Recently I have been having more symptoms and they have worsened. I have gained weight and also have developed high blood pressure. I had one episode that I had to call the EMTs for and they said that it registered on the rhythm strips that I was having SVT. At the hospital it only registered as sinus tachycardia but it rain in the 130-150s for about 2 hours then down to 110-120s for the next two and finally leveling off in the low 100s. I went to another cardiologist after this and was just told today (by a nurse) that the echocardiogram shows no MVP but shows mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. In the last few months I have had lots of tests including EKGs; 24-hour Holter; Thallium scan; and now this echocardiogram. I had one cardiologist about three months ago do the thallium; 24-hour monitor; and EKG and said i didnt need an ECHO. He said from listening that i DEFINITELY HAD MVP and that I needed to take SBE prophylaxis! After this episode with the SVT I decided to get a second opinion altogether and upon physical exam by the new cardiologist he says I DEFINITELY DONT have MVP but he performed this ECHO and the reading says now I have mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. This doctor put me on Verapamil to help with the blood pressure and the arrhythmia and tachycardia problems. My question to you is WHY all the discrepancies. What am I to believe? How serious is this? I understand that it can be progressive and can need repair? I would just like some general information so that I will know what kind of questions to ask him when I go in for my follow-up appt. in about a week. I am very perplexed and concerned that anyone really knows what is going on with me. I have a VERY STRONG family history for heart disease of all sorts including in m y father alone stroke;CAD;CHF; Pacemaker! so I really would like to try to avoid these problems if possible.

917,Atenolol+hypertension,"Dear Dr. Lately it seems that my heart rate is taking longer to return to resting after exercise than usual. For the last several weeks; I exercise at 140-150 bpm for 45-50 minutes; and after 15 minutes cool down; my heart rate is still in 120-130 range. It used to come down to 110 or so after that time. I'll admit that I tend to panic if my heart rate is in any way suspect; but I think I am seeing a difference in the last few weeks. I take a diuretic for high BP; and I wonder if I may be dehydrated; but there has no change in BP medication in last several weeks. Also; 3 months ago my doctor increased my thyroid medication; so this may be a factor. Other than post-exercise; my pulse is behaving nicely. I had an echo 2 years ago that was ""normal"".

However I would like to thank you in advance for any suggestions you may make. I am a 34 year old male and I have been dealing with a tremor mostly on my left side for app 11/2 years. The tremor seemed to start after I had an episode of high blood pressure. To be more precise; I had some type of ""attack"" after experiencing a very painful stomach ache.(I have had this before this particular time but it always subsided quickly). At the time of my stomach problem; my heart began to race and beat like it was coming out of my chest;(I at first thought it was a heart attack) then I felt a wave go from my chest up to my head; I felt my neck pounding in sync with my heart and then my head started pounding at the same rate. The sensation subsided enough for me to find my wife. I was ashen and chilled; after approx 2 hours she finally convinced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they found my Blood pressure to be 174/124 so they admitted me (over the night my BP would fluctuate from normal to extremely high. The hospital did a CT scan for an aneurysm and check my adrenal glands both came back normal. I started seeing an internist who after extensive testing said it was a case of eradict high blood pressure. He put me on atenolol 25mg which seems to have cared for the BP But.. Since this episode I have begun to shake (sometimes to the point of distraction) on my left side. For the first few months my left hand shook so bad that a nurse even ask why I was shaking. I also had problems standing or sitting without losing my balance (has since gone away). I have had a few memory problems ( very sporadic) One; I told my wife that I cleaned out our van (we havent owned a van for over 5 years). The doctor chaulked it up to stress. The other noticable problems include lethargy and incredible pain in the muscles in my hands (usually when I get up in the morning on days that my tremor is worse.) The internist told me that it was E.T.; but after I noticed my left leg shaking after working in the yard and my jaw shaking while talking to a client; he sent me to a neurologist. This doctor ; after poking me with a pin and doing a couple of reflex test also said it was E.T. He started testing various drugs at various levels. first;atenolol 75- 100mg then; neurotin 300 - 900 mg and finally;mysoline 25mg (made me very sick). Nothing stopped the tremor. I feel there is some underlying cause; but they both have said that my episode has nothing to do with the tremor. but why did it become evident only after my other problems. I am sorry for the length of the post but I am still searching for answers Thanks On the basis of the information avaulable I would have to agree with your physicians that this is likely to be essential tremor; unrelated to the paroxysmal episode of erratic blood pressure. It is true that essential tremor is not linked to specific events like episodes of raised blood pressure. The worst neurological sequel to the this sort of event would be a stroke; but strokes do not lead to the development of isolated tremor. While I realise the coincidence is puzzling and frustrating I cannot establish a clear cause and effect relationship between these two events. One possible fact may be useful; beta blockers may be used to treat both ET and hypertension ; but Atenolol is not the best choice as its effects are selective for the cardio-vascular system and will be of less beneftit for the tremor.

920,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have periods of persistent atrial fibrillation. The first was in 2010 and was successfully cardioversed precisely after six months. The second period was in spring 2012 and was cardioversed after six weeks' warfarin treatment. The present period is going on now (from 6. January) and will be cardioversed after 7 weeks from the beginning. An electric cardioversion immediately after the onset of AF is possible only when one is 100% sure that it has not lasted more than 48 h. Otherwise one must be on Warfarin (Marevan) so that INR is on the therapeutic level at least for three weeks. At all times of my AF; I have had INR on the therapeutic level (2-3) soon and mainteined it there for all the AF time (and a few extra months). At the meantime I have used ""children's aspirin). Is it good to keep people with AF for too long times? Why do doctors not study causes of AF? I myself have suggested eg. dehydration; infections and hyperparathyroidism for causes of AF. I have not had thorough heart studies and discussions in a hospital. I have organized them at sevearal private doctors' offices. When people go to electric cardioversion to the hospital; it is performed in a steady stream with only short discussion with the doctor. ECG has been done several times. I have a small leakage of mitral valve. During the second period of AF the leakage was possibly slightly larger than during the first AF. With AF; my pulmonary pressure rises and left atrium enlarges. ProBNP rises at least to over 2400. Doctors did not begin to measure it; I ordered the measurement myself. But the rise does not matter. I have respiratory difficulties. After the six-month AF in 2010 the left atrium; however; shrank to normal (in 2011). Enlargement of the left atrium is thus not a cause of my AF but a consequence. Is it good to keep me with AF? My blood pressure and pulse have always been very variable. I am now 65 years. In the nineteen eighties I often had paroxysmal tachycardia. Atenolol was begun and I am still using it. Possibly I got CFS (ME) in the eighties. At the change of 2009-2010 I had some infections; and before the AF period in 2010 I ordered a test for autonomic nervous system. In 1/3-maximal grip (maximal was 30.4) test my blood pressure was 259/140 (at rest before the test 153/80). The increase was: systolic 106 mmHg and diastolic 57. In Valsalva test pulse reaction was weak. In deep breathing test respiratory arhythmia was weaker than normal. In orthostatic test blood pressure reactions were strong: at 30 sec systolic +47 and at 3 min systolic +87. Atenolol 50 mg and Thyroid 2;5 G were in use. As a conclusion of the autonomous nersvous systen test it was said that; the result did not clearly deviate from normal. The weak pulse reaction can result from already high pulse at the beginning. Maybe sympaticotonia causes the greater blood pressure increase and the higher pulse. My blood pressure and pulse are very variable during the AF; and also without AF. During AF my diastolic pressure is sometimes increased. Sometimes; when sitting; my blood pressure varies between 98/71 and 141/109. In an ambulatory (24 h) blood pressure test (without atenolol) in 2006; my systolic pressure varied between 98 and 228 (mean 141). Diastolic pressure varied varied between 44-113 (mean 84). The pulse varied between 64 and 137 (mean 91). I was ashtonished; because my pulse pressure minimum and maximum were 14 and 134!! Why? I have chronic sinusitis. At the change of 2012-2013 I have had dyspnea and respiratory infection and norovirus. I have some inconsistency in my iron status. I have not iron deficiency but have small and pale red cells. Maybe I have slight secondary anemia due to infections. I have too low IgG3 and complement lectin pathway. I have nodules in my lungs. They have not increased in size during two years. I am on thyroid medication (Thyroid Erfa). Partial diabetes insipidus could not be excluded in a water deprivation test. I have Sjoegren's syndrome and cervical dystonia. The latest diagnosis is too thick endometrium. I am using 25 mcg estrogen and every second month progesterone (Terolut). When I on January 6 2013 was in the Emergency unit; my red cell count was 5.52; hemoglobin 153 and hematocrit 0.45. Na+ was 146 (137-144 normal!); fP-gluc 6;6 (!; no diabetes). I think that I was dehydrated. My dehydration may be due to partial diabetes insipidus; hyperparathyroidism; or vitamin D. Vitamin D intake was increased early in autumn 2012 from 25 mcg to 50 mcg. Then I had; according to a doctor; to increase D-vitamin intake to 100. At the end of 2012 I had increased it to 75 mcg; and then I was one day at 100 mcg.

921,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm a 27 year old female; 6'1; and 310 lbs. Yes; I am fat- but please don't focus in on that. For the last three weeks I have been having daily ""spells."" I become very discombobulated; my vision blurs; eyes loose focus; feel disconnected from my body. Most times; I am able to get to the floor of my own accord and wait out the feelings. Twice they hit so suddenly; I crumpled loosing conciousness for a fraction of a second (standing to prone is blank). For a few of these episodes there were nursing staff quickly on hand that checked my BP and pulse (bottom number on BP elevated; pulse pretty normal). I have been to ER; urgent care; and my PCP; the only thing they have been able to tell me is that I'm having episodes of near syncope. The EKGs have all been good; blood work- fine; urinalisis- good; thyroide-operational; and event monitor shows normal readings. Spell symptoms include: light head; sinus pressure; head aches; tingling hands and feet; chest pain (both sides; not just heart area); numbness across shoulders and down arms; brown outs; eye strain/pain; heavy head; tingling scalp; feel like moving through sludge; extreme exhaustion; loss of motor control; thick tongue feeling; difficult to speak and understand; and occasionally bright/dark/wiggle spots in vision. Post spells I am usually completely exhausted (can sleep for hours); disoriented; loss of concentration; blurred vision; pin and needles- all of these can go on for hours. I have spent the last three days in a constant state of dreaminess; like my mind and body are moving independently; have had several minor spells; and what worries me- my finger nails have started turning blue. Both my hand and my feet will become cold as ice within seconds of being immobile- the nails have started to turn a deep indigo blue shade as well. I've read many other posts about people having some of these symptoms; but I can't seem to see any solutions. Additionally; I have a few other worries to throw in. I ""had"" blood clots in Sep '07; superficial- documented with ultrasound. The clots were still there; in the exact same place; when they were looked at again (ultrasound) in Nov '08. When I had my first spell; three weeks ago; the urgent care did a blood test and said that the clots were gone now. The pain; fatigue; and throbbing in my leg was just because of the vericose veins- said the Dr. It's not the same kind of pain as the veins have given me before. I have polycystic kidney disease; hypertension (treated with atenolol; 25mg-4yrs); and chronic sinusitis. I've tried to get the doctor to consider looking at my sinuses; CTing my kidneys (due to increased abnormal pain); or changing my atenolol. They all just keep going in circles about my heart because of the chest pains. I'm incredibly frustrated as I have been taken off the work schedule until released by my PCP and she is doing nothing to help my figure all this out. My depression is getting worse; I'm starting to worry myself- which is causing more anxiety- which isn't helping my current condition. I have spoken to multiple DRs and nurses about the atenolol side effects I had experienced and they all tell me that they've ""never heard of anyone having that reaction before."" As the abnormal weight gain (about 60lbs in 1 1/2yrs); sluggishness; moodiness; and depression are all on the list of side effect to speak to your DR about on the med description- I'm confused. I realize that this is probably a needlessly long and rambling post; chock full of irrelevant information- but; please; don't let that deter anyone from giving whatever advice or useful thoughts you may have. I really need help with this; I'm reaching the end of my rope trying to get someone to listen and help me.",2009,2009,,,im 27 year old femal 61 310 lbs yes i fat pleas dont focus for last three week i daili spell i becom discombobul vision blur eye loos focus feel disconnect bodi most time i abl get floor accord wait feel twice hit sudden i crumpl loos concious fraction second stand prone blank for episod nurs staff quick hand check bp puls bottom number bp elev puls pretti normal i er urgent care pcp thing abl tell im episod near syncop the ekg good blood work fine urinalisi good thyroideoper event monitor show normal read spell symptom includ light head sinus pressur head ach tingl hand feet chest pain side heart area numb across shoulder arm brown out eye strainpain heavi head tingl scalp feel like move sludg extrem exhaust loss motor control thick tongu feel difficult speak understand occasion brightdarkwiggl spot vision post spell i usual complet exhaust sleep hour disori loss concentr blur vision pin needl go hour i spent last three day constant state dreami like mind bodi move independ sever minor spell worri finger nail start turn blue both hand feet becom cold ice within second immobil nail start turn deep indigo blue shade well ive read mani post peopl symptom i cant seem see solut addit i worri throw i blood clot sep 07 superfici document ultrasound the clot still exact place look ultrasound nov 08 when i first spell three week ago urgent care blood test said clot gone the pain fatigu throb leg vericos vein said dr it kind pain vein given i polycyst kidney diseas hypertens treat atenolol 25mg4yr chronic sinus ive tri get doctor consid look sinus cting kidney due increas abnorm pain chang atenolol they keep go circl heart chest pain im incred frustrat i taken work schedul releas pcp noth help figur my depress get wors im start worri caus anxieti isnt help current condit i spoken multipl drs nurs atenolol side effect i experienc tell theyv never heard anyon reaction as abnorm weight gain 60lbs 1 12yr sluggish moodi depress list side effect speak dr med descript im confus i realiz probabl needless long rambl post chock full irrelev inform pleas dont let deter anyon give whatev advic use thought may i realli need help im reach end rope tri get someon listen help

I take 40mg in the morning and 40mg before bed; but i am beginning to think that this drug; after 6 months of taking it; is starting to play havoc with my circulation. I am constantly feeling dizzy; breathless when try to stand up or move about; simple things cause me to feel unsteady and i often feel like im gona pass out and then have a panic attack. I want to see if it is indeed the Propranalol that is causing it. I want to reduce to 20mg x 2 daily and see if this helps with the symptoms but dont want to do it too quickly causing more side effects.

924,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been experiencing periodic spells of tachycardia off and on for about 6 months now. Was hospitalized overnight once; and all bloodwork; X-Rays; echocardiogram and so forth came back fine. I've been going to see an EP for 3 months now; have worn the event monitor; and all they came up with was sinus tach. My EP hasn't come up with a specific diagnosis; but suspects either Inappropriate Sinus Tach or an Atrial Tach that they haven't caught yet. The highest my pulse has gotten during any attacks has been about 140. At rest it can get as high as 95; up to 115 or so when standing. Exercise or eating doesn't seem to trigger any attacks. I don't have attacks everyday; and since I've been taking betablockers; I rarely ever have them. Resting blood pressure is good; standing as high as 140/100. I've tried 3 different types of betablockers; all low doses; and they all make me feel ill (exhausted; headaches; nightmares and insomnia). No PACs or PVCs that I'm aware of. Oh yes; I'm a 33 year old male; and have been in good shape for the past 18 years. Questions: 1. My EP says these problems may just go away on their own? Is this possible? 2. I'm scared to death of problems with impotence from the betablockers. Should I be concerned? 3. Do calcium channel blockers produce less side effects then betas? 4. Should I even be taking meds for these symptoms; or just deal with it? 5. Has anyone tried supplementing with magnesium or Hawthorn to control arrhythmias? 6. I've read that viral infections may cause arrhythmias. What type of doctor would I see to test for this?,2004,2004,,,ive experienc period spell tachycardia 6 month was hospit overnight bloodwork xray echocardiogram forth came back fine ive go see ep 3 month worn event monitor came sinus tach my ep hasnt come specif diagnosi suspect either inappropri sinus tach atrial tach havent caught yet the highest puls gotten attack 140 at rest get high 95 115 stand exercis eat doesnt seem trigger attack i dont attack everyday sinc ive take betablock i rare ever rest blood pressur good stand high 140100 ive tri 3 differ type betablock low dose make feel ill exhaust headach nightmar insomnia no pac pvcs im awar oh yes im 33 year old male good shape past 18 year question 1 my ep say problem may go away is possibl 2 im scare death problem impot betablock should i concern 3 do calcium channel blocker produc less side effect beta 4 should i even take med symptom deal 5 has anyon tri supplement magnesium hawthorn control arrhythmia 6 ive read viral infect may caus arrhythmia what type doctor would i see test
925,Atenolol+hypertension,Good Morning! I have some questions regaurding my health. Approx 2 1/2 years ago I began to have upper left shoulder pain. An upper GI showed nothing along with a stress echo which did show mild LV enlargement. Acouple of months after these tests the pain moved in mid of sternum;following lightheadiness;and nasua. I had a nuclear stress test which was also negative. In Jan of 2004 I had a heart cath that showed nothing. I have worn a holter monitor that showed pacs and pvc with 1 bout of SVT. My question is that with little excertion my heart pounds and I still have chest pains.I do smoke and blood pressure is usualy around 135/85.I also have thoracic subluxations of the spine. Does this sound like heart related with all tests or something else. Just another question is when I smoke my chest hurts behind the sternum.

927,Atenolol+hypertension,A healthy and happy New Year to you Cardio Docs! I have pain in my chest; jaw and arm. I am been worked up twice with a stress echo; twice in one year. I wore a holter during these episodes and it came back fine. I am on Atenolol. I have a few questions though. 1. Will Atenolol weaken my heart over time ? (years) 25 mg. I take it for pvc's. 2. Is the stress echo accurate in woman? I am 34 and otherwise healthy? I have had one regular stress test; an echocardiogram; and two stress echo's. (all within one year) 3. Can panic or anxiety really cause these same symptoms? ( chest/arm pain too?) Every time I go to the Er with these symptoms; my Ekg and enzymes are fine...Any clues? My cardio says its NOT my heart; but it sure feels like it when the pain in my chest hurts.

928,Atenolol+hypertension,"So some of you know that I'm a pain management patient and I took a ""drug holiday"" earlier this month (stopped my meds for 2 weeks in order to restart my tolerance)...I wasn't sure if I was going to refill my script or not; but I did. I don't have a problem abusing my medicine (I take 5mg Norco 3x a day) but I'm tired of having to take them around the clock or end up with withdrawals. So...I'm done. I'm in the middle of my script and when I woke up this morning I got the awful withdrawal-haven't-taken-a-pill-in-a-long-time feeling and I decided that I'm done. I made an appointment with my GP tomorrow and I need to know what to ask her..I'm going to ask for some medicine to help me deal with the withdrawals. I'm stopping cold turkey this weekend. We're moving into a new house and we're goin to be painting and putting down carpet and moving...but this is the best time for me to do it. I need to keep busy or I will start having panic attacks - I take the medicine for legitimate pain reasons and the thought of dealing with the pain without medicine has me panicked even now; so I know that I need to keep busy or I'll cave and start taking the medicine again and I just don't want it anymore. But by the same token I can't completely shut down; and I have 2 small children who rely on me (my husband will be home 4 days this weekend as well; which is why this is a good time for me to do it) so I need to be somewhat functional. what do you guys recommend? I know I""m going to get some multi-vitamins and protein shakes...I was thinking of asking for clonodine and something for anxiety; as well as something for RLS and sleep - when I've cut my meds out before the RLS and the interrupted sleep been the worst part of it for me. does anyone have anything else to recommend? my GP is very helpful and I think she'll give me whatever I feel like I need because I mean it's pretty much every doctor's dream to get their patient off of 24/7 pain meds right? anyway..I'm terrified. I really am. I've lived with pain meds for 5 years because my pain level is so high; and while I've stopped taking them before for weeks or months at a time...this time I'm really done. i want to be done. I know my pain is going to be back; but I don't know that it's not better than dealing with pain medicine 24/7 and all the appointments and side effects that come with it. please help me..I'm so scared. I need to do this NOW before I chicken out and continue the cycle. I already called and canceled my PM appointment for next month where I was supposed to get another refill; and it takes a long time to get an appointment so at this point it's do or die. (not really lol but you know what I mean). help..can I do this?! will the medicine help me?! I know I'm on a low dose; so I should be able to function...right? i know I need to buy immodium too....omg; I'm so scared; but I'm so ready. help...I know I'm not an ""addict"" but I'm physically dependent and you guys are the only ones I can think of who can help me...so please do. the pain terrifies me; it really does; but i'm done.",2009,2011,25.0,Female,so know im pain manag patient i took drug holiday earlier month stop med 2 week order restart tolerancei wasnt sure i go refil script i i dont problem abus medicin i take 5mg norco 3x day im tire take around clock end withdraw soim done im middl script i woke morn i got aw withdrawalhaventtakenapillinalongtim feel i decid im done i made appoint gp tomorrow i need know ask herim go ask medicin help deal withdraw im stop cold turkey weekend were move new hous goin paint put carpet movingbut best time i need keep busi i start panic attack i take medicin legitim pain reason thought deal pain without medicin panick even i know i need keep busi ill cave start take medicin i dont want anymor but token i cant complet shut i 2 small children reli husband home 4 day weekend well good time i need somewhat function guy recommend i know im go get multivitamin protein shakesi think ask clonodin someth anxieti well someth rls sleep ive cut med rls interrupt sleep worst part anyon anyth els recommend gp help i think shell give whatev i feel like i need i mean pretti much everi doctor dream get patient 247 pain med right anywayim terrifi i realli ive live pain med 5 year pain level high ive stop take week month timethi time im realli done want done i know pain go back i dont know better deal pain medicin 247 appoint side effect come pleas help meim scare i need now i chicken continu cycl i alreadi call cancel pm appoint next month i suppos get anoth refil take long time get appoint point die realli lol know i mean helpcan i medicin help i know im low dose i abl functionright know i need buy immodium tooomg im scare im readi helpi know im addict im physic depend guy one i think help meso pleas pain terrifi realli im done
929,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello; I am a 38 yo white male with a family history of heart disease (Dad died of CAD at 42; maternal Grandmother had 1st heart attach at 52). I was diagnosed with CAD in June and had angioplasty & 4 stents (Cordis drug eluding type) for 2 blockages each in my LAD & RCA. I suffered a complication; my artery was perforated during the proceedure and a pericardial effussion started; leading to cardiac tamponade and a near death experience. An emergencey Pericardiocentisis followed along with days in the ICU with a drain in my chest; then several months of steroids to shrink the effussion. Follow up echoes show the effussion to be gome and no damage to my heart. I am now on Lipitor80 & Zetia10; and my ldl is down from 160 to 72. I'm also on Plavix; Enalapril; asprin and Atenolol (25mg x2). I have Gerd to add to all this. I constantly feel chest; gastric pains & palpitaions and these lead to what I believe are panic attacks. I have had 2 thallium stress tests at 2 different facilities in the last 6 weeks; both of which were negetive. My cardiologist assures my that I am fine; I do not have a new blockage or restenosis. He believes that I am suffering from anxiety problems; which I am now forced to agree with. I believe that I am sufferuring from a panic disorder (cardiac neurosis?); I take my pulse and check my BP constantly and I panic at every discomfort I feel in my chest. It is becomming a problem for me. Do you come across this sort of thing very often? What treatments or therapies do you recommend for your patients who suffer from similiar problem?,2004,2004,37.0,Male,hello i 38 yo white male famili histori heart diseas dad die cad 42 matern grandmoth 1st heart attach 52 i diagnos cad june angioplasti 4 stent cordi drug elud type 2 blockag lad rca i suffer complic arteri perfor proceedur pericardi effuss start lead cardiac tamponad near death experi an emergencey pericardiocentisi follow along day icu drain chest sever month steroid shrink effuss follow echo show effuss gome damag heart i lipitor80 zetia10 ldl 160 72 im also plavix enalapril asprin atenolol 25mg x2 i gerd add i constant feel chest gastric pain palpitaion lead i believ panic attack i 2 thallium stress test 2 differ facil last 6 week neget my cardiologist assur i fine i new blockag restenosi he believ i suffer anxieti problem i forc agre i believ i sufferur panic disord cardiac neurosi i take puls check bp constant i panic everi discomfort i feel chest it becom problem do come across sort thing often what treatment therapi recommend patient suffer similiar problem
930,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted by V. Talley on August 03; 1999 at 13:09:49 I am a 19 year old female and have just recently started having problems with my blood pressure. I was taked to the emergency room a few days ago- my blood pressure was 175/120 - I was given several medicines and it took several hours for any of them to be effective. The ER Doctor put me on 60mg procardia once a day. I put a call in to my regular physician but she was out of town and one of the other doctors that works with her wanted to see me right away. He was a young doctor and seemed somewhat unsure of himself. He offered no reasons why I might be having this trouble nor did he tell me any ways that this could be regulated- ie diet. He simply changed my medicine to atenolol and had me go for a chest x-ray. The medicine seems to be making me feel drained and like I have no energy and my blood pressure is still high. I thought that after a visit to the doctor I would feel less concerned about this and maybe have some answers- but I don't. Do you have any suggestions as to what could be causing this and should I seek further medical attention? Thank you for any response you may be able to provide. Posted by CCF CARDIO MD - CRC on August 03; 1999 at 13:55:10 It is somewhat unusual for a 19 year old to have high blood pressure but it is possible. I would ask your doctor to look for secondary causes of high blood pressure. It is possible your medication could be making you feel tired. This will also need to be addressed by your physician. Here is some general information about high blood pressure. High blood pressure; or hypertension (HTN) ; is defined in an adult as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart disease (which leads to heart attack) and stroke (or brain attack); especially along with other risk factors. High blood pressure can occur in children or adults; but is particularly prevalent in blacks; middle-aged and elderly people; obese people; heavy drinkers and women who are taking oral contraceptives. Individuals with diabetes mellitus gout or kidney disease have a higher frequency of hypertension. High blood pressure may be primary (essential) or secondary. If the hypertension is secondary there may be a treatable cause. Most of these causes are relatively rare (i.e. renal artery stenosis; pheochromocytoma). If no secondary cause is found then the high blood pressure is said to be primary. The vast majority of cases of HTN are primary. The main cause of primary HTN is genetic. Q: I am hoping to get pregnant in the future and I am wondering if this will effect things? A: Blood pressure may be elevate during pregnancy and if you have a predisposition to high blood pressure it should be closely monitored during pregnancy. Q: I believe the higher blood pressure is directly related to anxiety which may be OK for the ""normal"" person; however with me having this disorder I deal with anxiety A LOT and I often endure it without my medication. A: It is important to take the medication you need for anxiety. In addition you may need blood pressure medication if your high blood pressure continues. Q: How do salt and sodium affect high blood pressure? A: Most Americans consume far more salt (sodium) than their bodies need. Heavy sodium consumption increases blood pressure in some people; leading to high blood pressure. People who are diagnosed with high blood pressure are often placed on restricted-sodium diets. Reducing sodium (or salt) consumption may help lower blood pressure in some people. Your doctor may recommend a sodium (salt) restricted diet. This will mean you'll have to avoid salty foods and cut down on the amount of salt you use in cooking and at the table. Q: How does being overweight affect high blood pressure? A: Studies have shown that body weight; changes in body weight over time; and skinfold thickness are related to changes in blood pressure levels. These factors have been linked to the subsequent rise and development of high blood pressure. People who are overweight are more likely to have high-normal to mild high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease. In addition; a sedentary or inactive lifestyle tends to contribute to obesity; a risk factor for both high blood pressure and heart disease.

931,Atenolol+hypertension,am a 14 year old girl and was diagnosed yesterday with left ventricular hypertrophy caused by my hypertension. The cause for my hypertension is unknown. I don't exercise but Im fit and normal weight. I keep a low-slt diet. I am not being treated with atenolol 25 mg twice a day. So my question is that how quickly does the ventricualr hypertrophy usually progress? When I saw my cardiologist iN january i did not have it and in a 6-month period it developed. I also have mitral valve regurgitation and diagnosed with arrhythmias.,2009,2009,,,14 year old girl diagnos yesterday left ventricular hypertrophi caus hypertens the caus hypertens unknown i dont exercis im fit normal weight i keep lowslt diet i treat atenolol 25 mg twice day so question quick ventricualr hypertrophi usual progress when i saw cardiologist in januari 6month period develop i also mitral valv regurgit diagnos arrhythmia
932,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm 53;don't smoke; never drank;no drugs;no coffee. Had palpitations since 13 years old but rarely. Sometimes on a daily basis and other times with days or weeks of no skips. About two weeks ago the palpitations started coming in a regular manner at about 3-5 per hour pretty much every hour of the day. This of course was frightening and I worried and became more aware of every skip. By the third day the skips were at every minute with a few doubles/triples ( each with only a few regular beats between them. I was in terror so I went to the local ER. They took Xrays;blood work;EKG's a 24hr holter monitor. The ER doc saidthe PACs were frequent with an occassional PVC but they were probably benign. He suggested I see a Cardiologist as my blood pressure was quite high at 180/100. I have always had white coat hypertension and at home with the nurse neighbor taking it was 145/90.The Cardiologist reviewed all the tests including more blood work; echocardiogram; his conclusion was even though I was having lots of skips ; the condition was benign and my blood pressure was more of a concern. He recommended Atenolol 50mg and said it should resolve lessen the palps. Fearing the potential side effects I took half dose first as within 4 hours my bp was at 110/75 with a scary pulse rate of 52-56. My resting rate is usually 62 The pressure and low pulse rate continued all day. I started a advanced excercise diet program about 8 weeks before these palps started and lost 25 lbs. Lots of cardio and weights. The blood work showed slight elevation in magnesium.Scared to death.,2002,2002,,,im 53dont smoke never drankno drugsno coffe had palpit sinc 13 year old rare sometim daili basi time day week skip about two week ago palpit start come regular manner 35 per hour pretti much everi hour day this cours frighten i worri becam awar everi skip by third day skip everi minut doublestripl regular beat i terror i went local er they took xraysblood workekg 24hr holter monitor the er doc saidth pac frequent occassion pvc probabl benign he suggest i see cardiologist blood pressur quit high 180100 i alway white coat hypertens home nurs neighbor take 14590the cardiologist review test includ blood work echocardiogram conclus even though i lot skip condit benign blood pressur concern he recommend atenolol 50mg said resolv lessen palp fear potenti side effect i took half dose first within 4 hour bp 11075 scari puls rate 5256 my rest rate usual 62 the pressur low puls rate continu day i start advanc excercis diet program 8 week palp start lost 25 lbs lot cardio weight the blood work show slight elev magnesiumscar death
933,Atenolol+hypertension,Posted By V. Talley on August 03; 1999 at 13:09:49 I am a 19 year old female and have just recently started having problems with my blood pressure. I was taked to the emergency room a few days ago- my blood pressure was 175/120 - I was given several medicines and it took several hours for any of them to be effective. The ER Doctor put me on 60mg procardia once a day. I put a call in to my regular physician but she was out of town and one of the other doctors that works with her wanted to see me right away. He was a young doctor and seemed somewhat unsure of himself. He offered no reasons why I might be having this trouble nor did he tell me any ways that this could be regulated- ie diet. He simply changed my medicine to atenolol and had me go for a chest x-ray. The medicine seems to be making me feel drained and like I have no energy and my blood pressure is still high. I thought that after a visit to the doctor I would feel less concerned about this and maybe have some answers- but I don't. Do you have any suggestions as to what could be causing this and should I seek further medical attention?

936,Atenolol+hypertension,I've been dealing with the darn PVCs on a daily basis for 8 months now. It seems like they are becoming more frequent. I'm taking potassium and angstrom mg for 2-3 weeks with no improvement. Every time I have an active or stressful day I am punished at night with a string of PVCs that can last for hours. They appear to be adrenaline related. It has made my life miserable. My EP gave me a special script for an EKG for when I got a bad episode; so last night I went to the ER and they hooked me up. They saw PVCs coming every few seconds; and the technician said they all looked identical; so it appears that they are unifocal. I'm not sure what to do here. I don't have PVCs ALL day; but I do get them EVERY day. Some days are manageable; other days are very frustating. I am living right now for the moments when I am PVC free. Not a good way to live your life. So my question to all you fellow sufferers is; is the ablation worth the possible risks? And what are they? Thanks for your responses.,2011,2011,41.0,Male,ive deal darn pvcs daili basi 8 month it seem like becom frequent im take potassium angstrom mg 23 week improv everi time i activ stress day i punish night string pvcs last hour they appear adrenalin relat it made life miser my ep gave special script ekg i got bad episod last night i went er hook they saw pvcs come everi second technician said look ident appear unifoc im sure i dont pvcs all day i get everi day some day manag day frustat i live right moment i pvc free not good way live life so question fellow suffer ablat worth possibl risk and thank respons
937,Atenolol+hypertension,I was diagnosed with SVT 3yrs ago; and decided against the ablation; took Toprol xl for a time but currently take no meds for it. It is much better than when I was first diagnosed though I still have attacks. I am taking fertility treatments and told the re about the svt. He agreed to treat me; but I am wondering if any of you with svt had any trouble with your attacks becoming more frequent or severe during pregnancy? I am concerned that if I become pregnant it will suddenly worsen. Also; do any of you with svt experience neck problems during an attack? When my hr approaches 200 during one; my neck tightens up on both sides and I can feel the pulse much more prominently than in my chest. It actually feels as if something could burst but I know it wouldn't really happen. I've asked my dr if I might have anxiety as well but he says I do not. I'd appreciate any advice or comments; thanks so much! em,2006,2006,,,i diagnos svt 3yr ago decid ablat took toprol xl time current take med it much better i first diagnos though i still attack i take fertil treatment told svt he agre treat i wonder svt troubl attack becom frequent sever pregnanc i concern i becom pregnant sudden worsen also svt experi neck problem attack when hr approach 200 one neck tighten side i feel puls much promin chest it actual feel someth could burst i know wouldnt realli happen ive ask dr i might anxieti well say i id appreci advic comment thank much em
938,Atenolol+hypertension,10 years ago I was Dx w/hiatal hernia. In Oct had an endoscopy and diagnosed w/extreme gastrits and given Rx of 30mg Prevacid daily. In first week of Feb began to experience extreme discomfort and pressure at the xiphoid process of the sternum and along the entire diaphram (side to side). It kind of feels like something is 'folding' or pushing up under the sternum & ribs. My GP adv me to take 30mg of 2x daily for 12days and then 1x a day. On day 3 of returning to the 1x dosage; I began to exp palpatations/shortness of breath in addition to the extreme sternum pressure. GP put on a holter for the 24 hours. Told GP about the experience on the Prevacid and questioned if the 30mg was too much and she decreased my Rx to 15mg per day. I had not taken any Prevacid for over 48 hours and was beginning to feel better palpatation wise; however the reflux acid was up and pressure the same; so after having the new Rx filled took one 15mg of Prevacid. Within 45 minutes the palpatations were back with a vengance. GP refered me to an Internist who mentioned that only one episode was noted on the Holter of a heart rate incrase to 145bpm. I talked to her about the Prevacid and she advised me to quit taking it and manage the reflux w/Pepcid AC or Pepcid Complete over the counter; she advised 1 in AM and 2 in PM. The package insert says not to take more than 2 in 24 hour period. For 6 days followed package and did not take more than 2/24 hrs and slowly noticed a decrease of the palpatations but the sternum pressure has not lessened but was managing acid fairly well (sleep upright). Today there was increase of acid so I followed the Internists directive that I could take 3/24hrs one in AM and two PM... the palpatation/shortness of breath are back along with a feeling of 'distortion of reality'... i.e. like when you have 'medicine head' from taking cold medications. Stopped Pepcid and now on Rolaids and Maalox. As I had had the palpatations with two different 'types' of acid reducing drugs; research on the net found that Protonix; Prevacid; Prilosec; Nexium and Pepcid all have the advisment in thier package inserts that 'adverse experiences occurring in < 1% of patients' included Cardiovascular System disruptions -angina; arrhythmia; bradycardia; cerebrovascular accident/cerebral infarction; hypertension/hypotension; migraine; myocardial infarction; palpitations; shock (circulatory failure); syncope; tachycardia; vasodilation. I am scheduled for an Upper GI series as well as an echocardiogram. Is it possible that the medications are the underlying cuase of the palpatations? When I press 'firmly' and downward from the sternum towards my pelvic region; the pressure under the ribs/sternum is releived. Does that sound like the hernia may be worse? Can there be problems with someones diaphram that would cause this type of feeling under the sternum? I have lost 10lbs since this began and there seems to be less pressure pushing upwards.,2002,2003,,,10 year ago i dx whiatal hernia in oct endoscopi diagnos wextrem gastrit given rx 30mg prevacid daili in first week feb began experi extrem discomfort pressur xiphoid process sternum along entir diaphram side side it kind feel like someth fold push sternum rib my gp adv take 30mg 2x daili 12day 1x day on day 3 return 1x dosag i began exp palpatationsshort breath addit extrem sternum pressur gp put holter 24 hour told gp experi prevacid question 30mg much decreas rx 15mg per day i taken prevacid 48 hour begin feel better palpat wise howev reflux acid pressur new rx fill took one 15mg prevacid within 45 minut palpat back venganc gp refer internist mention one episod note holter heart rate incras 145bpm i talk prevacid advis quit take manag reflux wpepcid ac pepcid complet counter advis 1 am 2 pm the packag insert say take 2 24 hour period for 6 day follow packag take 224 hrs slowli notic decreas palpat sternum pressur lessen manag acid fair well sleep upright today increas acid i follow internist direct i could take 324hrs one am two pm palpatationshort breath back along feel distort realiti ie like medicin head take cold medic stop pepcid rolaid maalox as i palpat two differ type acid reduc drug research net found protonix prevacid prilosec nexium pepcid advis thier packag insert advers experi occur 1 patient includ cardiovascular system disrupt angina arrhythmia bradycardia cerebrovascular accidentcerebr infarct hypertensionhypotens migrain myocardi infarct palpit shock circulatori failur syncop tachycardia vasodil i schedul upper gi seri well echocardiogram is possibl medic under cuas palpat when i press firm downward sternum toward pelvic region pressur ribssternum releiv doe sound like hernia may wors can problem someon diaphram would caus type feel sternum i lost 10lbs sinc began seem less pressur push upward
939,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello I am a 35 yr old male who has been suffering from unexplained abdominal problems for the past two months. A little past history first; two years ago I was diagnosed with Scleroderma Morphea. A Rheumatologist confirmed that it was not systemic this past January. A year ago I was diagnosed with hypertension 170/100. Prior to that I always had normal bp. Under meds (Lotensin; Atenolol and Tricor) I have low bp 95/60. About 8 weeks ago I was awoken by extreme pain just below the belly button which lasted roughly three hours; and I was tender for the next two days. I have had four episodes of these night pains since. I also have not slept thru the night in these 8 weeks and I am not sure what is waking me up. Since the first episode I have also been having short duration; varying in severity pains along either flank and across the bottom of the abdomen. I notice these pains only during the day; usually three to four times a day. On two different days I had 100,2003,2003,,,hello i 35 yr old male suffer unexplain abdomin problem past two month a littl past histori first two year ago i diagnos scleroderma morphea a rheumatologist confirm system past januari a year ago i diagnos hypertens 170100 prior i alway normal bp under med lotensin atenolol tricor i low bp 9560 about 8 week ago i awoken extrem pain belli button last rough three hour i tender next two day i four episod night pain sinc i also slept thru night 8 week i sure wake sinc first episod i also short durat vari sever pain along either flank across bottom abdomen i notic pain day usual three four time day on two differ day i 100
940,Atenolol+hypertension,Female - 41 years old - good health except suffer from palpitations. I take celexa because I have anxiety issues that my doctor seems to think contribute to my palpitations. I can sometimes go 2 - 3 days without any palpitations and then wammo I get them every 5 minutes every day! You just never know when to expect them. My question is I have been for an EP study because when I had a holter it picked up a short run of v-tach and I insisted that I get an EP study. They study showed up nothing but I continue to get these skips and flutters. Could they have possibly missed something do you think? My other question is that when I am excited; stressed or whatever my heart quite often starts going into these really fast beats and I get quite dizzy. It is really hard to explain; it is not like when you have been running it just all of a sudden starts going fast and I seem to be able to stop it when I take a deep breath and hold it or it just does one really hard bang at the end of the run and goes back to normal. Do you think that sounds like a short run of SVT or do you think that sounds like v-tach? It still scares the daylights out of me thinking that this could be v-tach. My doctor says know big deal even it is because I have a normal heart. Do you agree? These fast beats don't happen a lot. I can go months without the fast beats and then when I am stressed or anxious it seems to happen more. Could it just my heart reacting to adrelin do you think? I know the PVC's feel like a surge sensation and and then a big wammo and the fast beats don't feel like.,2003,2003,,,femal 41 year old good health except suffer palpit i take celexa i anxieti issu doctor seem think contribut palpit i sometim go 2 3 day without palpit wammo i get everi 5 minut everi day you never know expect my question i ep studi i holter pick short run vtach i insist i get ep studi they studi show noth i continu get skip flutter could possibl miss someth think my question i excit stress whatev heart quit often start go realli fast beat i get quit dizzi it realli hard explain like run sudden start go fast i seem abl stop i take deep breath hold one realli hard bang end run goe back normal do think sound like short run svt think sound like vtach it still scare daylight think could vtach my doctor say know big deal even i normal heart do agre these fast beat dont happen lot i go month without fast beat i stress anxious seem happen could heart react adrelin think i know pvcs feel like surg sensat big wammo fast beat dont feel like
941,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question. Your answers to these questions are helping many people. I have had palpatations since I was 18; I am now 25. I just had a work up with a cardiologist who did an ekg and a echocardiogram. These test all came back normal. He said there was only a small leak or murmur on my mitral valve which I was probably born with. He said that I would just need to take a antibiotic before any major dental work. My family doctor said that everyone has small leaks and there is no such thing as a perfect heart. He then went on to say my EF was 60% which is excellent He couldnt really say what was causing my palpatations. When I went back to my Family doctor afterwards and had him do another holter(I did one back in 2002 and he said it only picked up ectopic beats and they were normal). That was a week ago and he hasnt called me back yet. I did catch alot of the palpatations on the holter. I will probably hear the same thing again benign palpatations. What is your opinion on my work ups. Are these test enough to rest my mind? I also am curious if the atenelol can ever make palpatations worse. I am on 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night. I would like to stop taking it. My doctor thinks it is better to be on it to prevent the palpatations. I want to just ignore these palpatations but it is hard! I have normal BP at home always. but I do get spikes at the doctors. I have taken my monitor to the doctor and it is accurate; it just reads a little higher than his actually.,2004,2005,,,thank much take time answer question your answer question help mani peopl i palpat sinc i 18 i 25 i work cardiologist ekg echocardiogram these test came back normal he said small leak murmur mitral valv i probabl born he said i would need take antibiot major dental work my famili doctor said everyon small leak thing perfect heart he went say ef 60 excel he couldnt realli say caus palpat when i went back famili doctor afterward anoth holteri one back 2002 said pick ectop beat normal that week ago hasnt call back yet i catch alot palpat holter i probabl hear thing benign palpat what opinion work up are test enough rest mind i also curious atenelol ever make palpat wors i 25mg morn 25mg night i would like stop take my doctor think better prevent palpat i want ignor palpat hard i normal bp home alway i get spike doctor i taken monitor doctor accur read littl higher actual

I can fell ok for days or weeks and then I hit a bad spell for days or weeks. I am unable to identify triggers; adide from heat; although many symptoms; especially hr & bp occur at night. Tests done: ekgs; echos; chest xrays; blood work; tilt table tests; eegs; mri (head; cervical spine; and abdomen); cat scans; 24 hour urines; stress test; and allergy tests. All were normal. Just recently; one batch of blood work showed low magnesium. I am taking supplements. I've seen every doctor in multiple disciplines and many could not find anything wrong. Multiple tests on heart and thyroid and even looked for rare things like pheo and carcinord. Last week Hyper beta adrenergic syndrome was suggested. Can you tell me more about that disorder. Toprol was prescribed but haven't started. Tried beta blockers before and didn't really help. Florinef sent me to ER with bp 154/105 three times and made me feel horrible. Prednisone did the same.

944,Atenolol+hypertension,"So every so often (maybe about 1 to 5 times a month) I feel; well; just plain odd. I get these spells where I feel like I'm not here. I look around me; and I feel like nothing is real. I can also be looking right at my hands; feet; or at myself in the mirror and I feel so confused. almost like I don't know who I am. I then feel tense; scared; my heart beat raises; and I feel like I'm going to faint. Now while this is happening; I have been able to control my thoughts; and I even experimented even under the deepest of fear; to state my name; my address; phone number; parents names; brother; girlfriend; all of their information; e-mail addresses; websites; and I pass all of these tests; but I still feel like I'm about to freak out! This all started October of 2003; one day my parents went out on a trip for the day; and I was on fall break from school. I was about 17. I had gotten out of a relationship; which at the time was still beatin me up pretty bad; I was depressed. So later that day I had decided; I was going to smoke weed; by myself; no one around; and just relax; and let life flow; while being high. Well; about an hour after smoking I started to browse around my computer; and noticed I was unable to concentrate on anything; I couldn't read; nor click my mouse on the right target. I then decided that I would just give it up; I was too high to play around; so I leaned back in my chair and started starring at the sealing. While doing this; I kept slowly bringing my head back down from a full upward look; but there was another issue. everytime I would look straight up; and back down; my images would get stuck; and my head would just nod and would never come back down; unless I really forced it to. I then began to get a little scared; and decided ""ok; thats enough!"" I went to get up; and that's when I felt it; FEAR! Fear like I've never known; so powerful I then started to grab my chest; which got real hot; and I started to panic; I then felt like no matter how much air I took in; I wasn't getting any at all; my vision became a tunnel; I some how got out of my chair; and began to run down the hall way; thinking I was going to die; my vision reacting slow; as if it were taking only pictures; and never streaming like normal. I then ran into my guest room; and landed on a couch; where I then felt pain all over my body! burning sensations going up my neck; into my brain; it burned so bad! my vision was finally restoring; but then I saw flashes of light; as if cameras were all around me! my heart rate was like a drum roll; so fast; I thought I was going to die! I was too afraid to call anyone for help; I thought if anyone came to the door it would make it worse; and all I could think about was ""we can't call the police for help; because they will find the weed!"" and that thought alone; the fact that I still had to hide it; pulled me through; but I was seeing images in my brain; and hearing myself scream for help; but only in my head; this all lasted for what felt like forever; but maybe 5 to 10 min. When I started to come back down; I turned on the tv; so I could have something to pay attention too; and I had to fight myself to concentrate; and I was so afraid for anyone to knock on the door; or to pass out; because maybe I would go through it again! I then laid there for about 30 min; and decided to take a cold shower; still shaking with fear; in the shower; I kept feeling fear; non-stop; so I got out about 10 min later; and tried to sleep in my room; but I was too afraid to sleep! but finally I did. I woke up about 6 hours later; still kinda shakin up; my parents had come back from their day out; and I decided to goto a friends house and tell the 3 people there what happened; but they all looked at me like I was insane. And that was that; it was my first (to what I believe) Panic Attack. later that year; and in 2004; I only had mild fears; and nothing to this nature ever returned. So now here we are; in 2007; August; and I still fear that this may happen again one day. But more recent; I just feel the warmth in my face; and fear; my vision sometimes slows down; and I do not feel real; and most of the time; if I splash water on my face; or grab a wet towel; I'm fine. so now I'm thinking a mild case of OCD? Now the thing is; before that torturous day in October; I had NEVER felt like that; EVER! And ever since that day; I've had anxiety. So it seems to me; that my mind is stuck in a loop; and I just need to boot it out! Now for a little background on myself; and family As for myself; I'm about to be 22; I'm about 300 pounds; 5'6 and have hypertension (high blood pressure) I take 50 MG of atenolol twice a day to regulate this; and take no other meds. my mother suffers from depression and anxiety; and my father has some anxiety; but nothing out of the ordinary; and they never have that bad of a spell to my knowledge. I'm a pretty easy going guy; I do have a lot of stress; and am looking forward to getting in shape; taking some martial arts; and eating better; because I fear diabetes as well. I have one older brother; who to my knowledge; doesn't suffer any symptoms; but has a HUGE problem with spending money haha. I have a current relationship that's lasted for 2 years; and life is good aside from the normal stress of everyday life; and retail. So I ask; am I ok? am I normal?

945,Atenolol+hypertension,"I cant drink anymore. I barely start getting drunk and I just hate it because of anxiety. I never used to drink that much but I loved it soo much. Everywhere else I've read people say alcohol helps anxiety temporarily (and worsens it long-term or for the hangover); but I just cant get drunk anymore. I think I have general drug anxiety. Like I cant smoke weed either (yes I know what marijuana does). Anytime my state of mind starts changing (which happens during the day; sober) I start freaking out. It's the derealization kind -- I associate head changes w/ derealization which a couple weeks ago I had really really bad. It sucks I wish I could get drunk again. Maybe I should try getting completely hammered -- the past two times I tried to drink I didn't have very much cause I started freaking out. I actually felt really good though afterwards I don't know why (like right now lol I'm actually pretty happy; slightly hungover; but feel ""in reality"" kind of like the opposite of derealization). I wish I could just stop worrying about things and instead enjoy stuff.",2007,2007,,,i cant drink anymor i bare start get drunk i hate anxieti i never use drink much i love soo much everywher els ive read peopl say alcohol help anxieti temporarili worsen longterm hangov i cant get drunk anymor i think i general drug anxieti like i cant smoke weed either yes i know marijuana anytim state mind start chang happen day sober i start freak it dereal kind i associ head chang w dereal coupl week ago i realli realli bad it suck i wish i could get drunk mayb i tri get complet hammer past two time i tri drink i didnt much caus i start freak i actual felt realli good though afterward i dont know like right lol im actual pretti happi slight hungov feel realiti kind like opposit dereal i wish i could stop worri thing instead enjoy stuff
946,Atenolol+hypertension,Dear Doctor; This is just to give you a brief summary; My father in law ; who is now past 85 years had his first surgery - removal of a giant liposarcoma of the rt. thigh in RCC; Thiruvananthapuram ; Kerala followed by radiotherapy for 6 weeks in 2006. Then he developed a tumour in his left thigh which was also removed next year as it was small; no radiation was done. With in 2 years he had some discomfort in the abdomen and a Ultrasound followed by CT showed a mass in the lesser sac next to the stomach which was removed in 2009 March. Surgeon could only remove 90% of it as it was too close to the stomach and pancreas. Before surgery the CXR and MRI showed 2 small ? secondaries in the periphery of the right lung (?pleural) and in the spine (D11 - which was irradiated before surgery for 5 days.)The pathology report for the thigh tumour and abdominal was Liposarcoma (dedifferentiated type I think). Otherwise my father in law was keeping robust health; his cardiac functions were very good; he has no diabetes and was never admitted before these episodes for any ailment. He has some hypertension( Developed late in life) with atenolol and an ace inhibitor . Now he has developed very early satiety and epigastric discomfort on eating and also a troublesome dry cough which indicates his abdominal tumour is back and may be the lung secondaries are growing too. The latest ultrasound done on 9/11/09; showed the abdominal tumour is back (approx20cm); though the lung secondaries haven’t increased in size. With this scenario of multiple tumours related to the liposaroma I would really appreciate your expert opinion. Will he benefit and withstand the cyber knife therapy.? I shall be grateful for an expert openion on whether cyber knife treatment will be useful for my father in law and will help in prolonging his life without much depreciation in the quality of life. The points for consideration are: 1. whether CK can be effectively used with this size of tumour in abdomen? 2. whether CK should be availed after further debulking surgery 3. what consequences are there if CK is applied to larger size tumour 4. whether CK can be effectively used for lung nodules which apparently has not grown so much 5. whether application of CK can increase his quality of life and /or life span 6. Is there any other palliative method to make his life comfortable If it is not inconvenient to you a reply by 15th Nov 09 will be highly appreciated as we are in the process of showing him to HCG enterprises Bangalore who have CK installed recently. We have taken some advice from Appollo Chennai and HCG Bangalore on the basis of documents. Appollo hospital advises to to debulk first thru surgery and then apply CK while HCG says even 2o cm tumour it fit case for CK treatment ; subject of course to their seeing latest CT scan.

948,Atenolol+hypertension,I was told I had atrial fib back in march because of my irregular heart rate.It is not always in a irregular rythym though.So Im wondering if I actually have it.My problem actually is though my heart races incredibly fast.My doctor had yet to figure out that problem.I am now on a events monitor because he wanted to know how fast it was and I could never count the beats.Well it happened and it started racing so I hit the record button and it recorded at 234 beats per min. Im assuming this isnt to dangerous because it has happened alot before.Maybe once a week or once every month.Its very unpredictable.Im not on any meds; only a aspirin daily.Im waiting to go back to the doctors.Dont know what to do? thanks donna,2009,2009,41.0,Female,i told i atrial fib back march irregular heart rateit alway irregular rythym thoughso im wonder i actual itmi problem actual though heart race incred fastmi doctor yet figur problemi event monitor want know fast i could never count beatswel happen start race i hit record button record 234 beat per min im assum isnt danger happen alot beforemayb week everi monthit unpredictableim med aspirin dailyim wait go back doctorsdont know thank donna

They were on the phone with my cardiologist most of the time and they said he seemed to think it was no big deal. My preasure came up with activity. I was having one of my moderatly ""bad"" days that day. They advised me to monitor my preasure several times a day and to not exert myself outside of the rehab center. my next two visits I had no problems.The RN suggested that it was my monopril causing all this.

952,Atenolol+hypertension,My names Chris; I'm 22; and a college student. I developed a tachycardia problem after I lost over 75 LBS at age 16. I'm now 22 and I weight 179 and i'm 6 foot 2. I suffer from an unknown tachycardia problem that none of the 6 cardiologists and 1 electrophysiologist can figure out. I can't exercise at all which is weird because i was athlete before i lost the weight. I'm now also scared to do any exertion because I can feel my heart in my throat non stop. Even if i dance a little; or do some push ups; my heart is beating so hard and I have to take deep breathes. I have tachycardia with going to the bathroom; the HEAT outside; eating heavy meals; and especially exertion. The problem is debilitating and handicapping my life. I've seen 6 cardiologists like i've said and also an electrophysiologist. I've had multiple thalium stress tests; CT angiogram with dye contrast; hundred echos; hundred EKGS. Tilt table test; event monitors; holter monitors. I've had some tiny episode of svt show up on monitor and atrial flutter once; also had anvrt show up once. My heart is structurally normal; i've also had all the blood work possible and a brain mri and also aortic anuersym check up 3 times. Ultra sounds of all organs so i've done it all basically. My question is ANYONE HAVE ANY INPUT ON WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT? I CAN'T GO OUT WITH FRIEND; NO GYM; NO BEACH; I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF LIVING IS; IF I'M HEALTHY BUT YET FEEL LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD. I'M CONVINCED I HAVE A BLOOD BLOT THEY CAN'T FIND OR A HEART DEFECT. I JUST FEEL LIKE SINCE I FEEL THIS STUFF THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG AND EVERY DAY I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT DROPPING DEAD NOW. ANYONE HAVE AN INPUT OR OPINION OF SOME KIND?,2010,2010,22.0,Male,my name chris im 22 colleg student i develop tachycardia problem i lost 75 lbs age 16 im 22 i weight 179 im 6 foot 2 i suffer unknown tachycardia problem none 6 cardiologist 1 electrophysiologist figur i cant exercis weird athlet lost weight im also scare exert i feel heart throat non stop even danc littl push up heart beat hard i take deep breath i tachycardia go bathroom heat outsid eat heavi meal especi exert the problem debilit handicap life ive seen 6 cardiologist like ive said also electrophysiologist ive multipl thalium stress test ct angiogram dye contrast hundr echo hundr ekg tilt tabl test event monitor holter monitor ive tini episod svt show monitor atrial flutter also anvrt show my heart structur normal ive also blood work possibl brain mri also aortic anuersym check 3 time ultra sound organ ive done basic my question anyon have ani input on what i should do next i cant go out with friend no gym no beach i honest dont know what the point of live is if im healthi but yet feel like an 80 year old im convinc i have a blood blot they cant find or a heart defect i just feel like sinc i feel this stuff there has to be someth wrong and everi day im just worri about drop dead now anyon have an input or opinion of some kind
953,Atenolol+hypertension,"After searching the internet and coming up with nothing time and time again about this mix... I am left in a slight dilemma. Firstly;I take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg per day for depression. I find it is working well for me. It does not cause me to be agitated at all. In fact; I feel totally normal on it. It has had the opposite effect on me I find; making me more relaxed or sleepy at times. I take the Wellbutrin XL at 8am everyday. By the time 5pm rolls around; I want to hit the gym. I live in dreary climate.. London; and I find I need something to help me weight train and have energy; get results etc. so I started taking a Bsn product some might consider controversial called No Xplode - ingredients listed below -- a nitric oxide / caffiene supplement. Reason why I am posting here is I really need a solid answer. I moved here from the U.S a few months ago and doctors here are not familiar at all with the drug Wellbutrin to treat depression - they seem to know less than me about it's effects and how it works.. so I can't ask my MD here.. I get my Wellbutrin from my dr. in the U.S - who I don't think would know what no xplode is over the phone.. So I need help from someone who knows.. I have not noticed any negative effects but I just started taking the n.o and i only take 1 scoop - the lowest dose/// I also take cell mass; a creatine supplement.. but I could cut that out if need be. Mainly; I find without the sports supplement I can't weight train properly and get good results - which in turn when I have a good workout and see results; I feel better in general; and happier - however; I am concerned about any long term effects or damage I might cause; with neuro transmitters etc. when combining these substances .. Here are the no xplode specs -- anybody know the deal? or know of a safer; better supplement for weight training / energy; muscularity etc? ""NO-Xplode is a Nitric Oxide boosting; muscle enhancing energy drink mix. The main component of NO-Xplode is its MetaFusion™ blend of ingredients.

954,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I'm a 28 year old male who recently wen to the ER for what I felt like was a heart attack. The problem is; I didn't actually go until the day after I had the attack; since I wasn't sure if I was having a panic attack or not and figured I would rest through the night to see if my condition improved. The doctor ran an EKG that came up perfectly normal; and they tested my heart rate and blood pressure; with slightly high blood pressure (138/80) being the only thing found. (I'm aware of my borderline hypertension; but they say its not bad enough to require meds). The doctor diagnosed me with having anxiety (being that I have a stressful work life); and prescribed me with lorazepam. Let me recap the night: I was sitting at home just watching TV with a friend; and we had just finished smoking a bowl of marijuana. I started to get light pains in the left hand side of my chest; upper back; and left shoulder. A few fingers in both hands were getting numb. In discomfort; I kept moving around in my chair trying to see if I just had bad posture. Eventually; I had a feeling right near my heart that felt like my heart stopped pumping for a second; followed by what I felt like was a surge going through my heart; causing my back to arch and for me to take in a deep breath. I also then felt some blurriness in my vision; and a slight soreness around my eye sockets (not the same soreness as I would get from smoking marijuana.) After the attack; I laid on the floor of my home face down to see if I could calm the attack. My dog ran from the other room without me making any noise at all and wouldn't stop trying to nudge himself closer to me. I sat there for about 30 minutes as the pain began to subside. I felt weak. throughout the course of the night; I would have mini ""heart stopping"" episodes that weren't nearly as bad as the first one; and I had a soreness underneath the back of my left shoulder blade and the left side of my chest for the rest of the night; and a couple days to follow; with a weird light fluttering feeling near my heart happening at random times after the attack. A couple days later; I tried to just smoke 3-4 hits of marijuana to see it triggered the attack; and I just felt some slight chest discomfort; nothing more. SO I figured I had just smoked too much the other night; causing an anxiety attack. I've been smoking for 7-8 years almost every day; and I don't see how an anxiety attack could just pop up at random; but the doctor told me that's what happened. The NEXT day; I smoked just 2 hits out of a bowl; trying to lightly smoke. I had another severe attack; with the same symptoms as the first attack. I laid on the floor and clutched at my left shoulder and massaged the left side of my rib cage until the pain subsided. I then went to sleep feeling weak and tired. Lately; I've been doing a lot of research on heart attacks and anxiety attacks; just to see what I may have been experiencing the night I had the attack. There are a few things that bother me about his diagnosis. From what I understand; panic/anxiety attacks can cause a rapid heart beat and frantic thought. My experience was just the opposite. My heart wasn't beating really fast; it felt like there was some sort of blockage to my heart; and that it ""seized"" up momentarily. I wasn't frantically thinking about anything; just trying to take deep breaths and almost meditate while on the floor. Anxiety attacks also seem to cause a pressure in the center of the chest; where mine was mostly concentrated to the left side of my chest. DId I have a mild heart attack; possibly due to some other heart condition that I'm not aware of; triggered by the marijuana smoking? Or is it possible that even with all this information; I just had an unusual anxiety attack? I have an appointment to see a cardiologist in about a week for a stress test; but I want to see if I can get some educated responses about my experience. Please; no ""you should just quit marijuana; it's illegal"" or ""drugs are bad"" talk. I'm looking for educated opinions.

955,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone; Just wondering if it’s possible that my heart focus (cardiophobia) can lead to the very low blood pressure or high blood pressure I have daily? Same for the pulse rate; sometimes it’s so low that I think I will faint and sometimes I entering into superventricular tachycardia who last 2-3 hours in a row with a pulse of 160 and more… I ask this cause last week I had a holter monitor 24 hours to record my heart and the pulse rate cause I have superventricular tachycardia almost everyday since 1 month and strangely; the 24 hours I wear the holter monitor; I was able to do a lot of physical tasks and had NO chest pain at all; had no tachycardia (only in the morning but was around 110 for 1 hour or less) and when I return to the hospital to have the holter monitor remove; as soon as I return in the car; my heart start going crazy again; in the eveniing the chest pain was back; the morning after I had a very fast pulse rate of 160-180 for 3 hours in a row; had the same fast pulse rate at the end of the afternoon after I take a normal bath… Same for the blood pressure… It was high for the whole month; especially the diastolic number ( around 150/95-110); and now it’s seem to be low ( around 110/55-60)… I’m quite worried about all of this and also confuse… Why suddenly my blood pressure return to the low side while I had it higher for the whole february month??? IS it me who monitoring too much my blood pressure and pulse rate or I pay to much attention to it??? When my blood pressure is too high I feel bad and think that I will have a heart attack or a stroke… and when my blood pressure is slow; I feel like I will faint; my pulse rate is higher and I feel bad also… it’s seem that I feel all the time bad cause of my heart… I’m a little bit frustrated cause the holter monitor will give normal results and my Cardiologist will call me and say I have nothing wrong BUT in fact I have a lot of weirds things who happen with my heart since a while… the chest pain; the back pain; numbness of my left arm and hand; headache with pulsating veins on the temple of my head all the time; eyes pain; dizziness; intolerance to physical exercise; emotionnal stress will trigger superventricular tachycardia; things like that… Of course; my family Doc do some test at his clinic when I saw him last week and find out that my blood pressure and pulse rate are weird; he took my pulse rate when I was standing and ask me to do some exercise in his office and take my pulse rate again 1 minute after and my pulse rate who was at 70 before jump to 168 with only minimal physical exercise… same when i’m sit and when I stand; I have a big difference in my pulse rate as well as my blood pressure… it tend to be lower for the blood pressure while i’m standing than when i’m sit… Sometimes I wonder if the Klonopin and the Xanax can lead to those weird symptoms? I’m now so anxious about all of this that I link some foods to the fact that my blood pressure or my pulse rate is high or low… that’s like an obsession… I barely eat now cause I fear to have a bad reaction to food that I eat!!! I also loose 21 pounds in less than 2 months… no wonder why…. For example; everything with calcium increase my blood pressure and reduce my pulse rate… fruits and vegetables tend to make me sick (intestine pain and bloating; chest pain) and decrease my blood pressure; bread; pasta; rice tend to increase my blood pressure BUT can also lower it… I now fear to take my vitamins that I need daily cause of my gastric by-pass surgery I had to loose weight years ago… the Iron pills will increase my blood pressure; the Vitamin D will decrease it; the Calcium pills increase it OR lower it; the Vitamin A tend to increase it… I now give up on the beta-blocker; I try the Acebutolol 3 times and had bad reaction to it… I had some Inderal pills and since one month I was used to take 2.5-5 mg of Inderal when I had the superventricular tachycardia and it was reducing a little bit my pulse rate but was making me a lot anxious cause of the low blood pressure I had with it (low systolic number but ; I don’T know why… and mno difference for the diastolic number); my Family Doc RX another beta-blocker last week; it’s call Atenolol and I try it 2 times and felt very bad on it also; worse than on the Inderal… It’s like my adrenal glands are all ****** up… can’t tolerate low dose of beta-blocker… Anyway… i’m tired of this situation… I now fear to get out of my bed in the morning cause my heart always race… at daytime my pulse rate increase and decrease all the time; who is normal when you have normal pulse rate but on me it’s not normal cause it’s always too high or too low…. ; I can’t fall asleep at night or nap at daytime even if I feel completly exhausted; who is strange cause in december and january I was sleeping more than 8 hours in a row and was doing long nap at daytime without any problem… I now have to take some Remeron at very low dose (3 mg maximum before bedtime to be able to fall asleep… under 3 mg the Remeron don’t affect the adrenaline release… but it’s now begin to be not effective and don’t want to increase the dosage to more than 3 mg cause I don’t want the adrenaline receptor to be touch… What to do with all of this? My Therapist don’t seem to know what to do right now… Thanks for you support!,2010,2011,,,hi everyon just wonder possibl heart focus cardiophobia lead low blood pressur high blood pressur i daili same puls rate sometim low i think i faint sometim i enter superventricular tachycardia last 23 hour row puls 160 i ask caus last week i holter monitor 24 hour record heart puls rate caus i superventricular tachycardia almost everyday sinc 1 month strang 24 hour i wear holter monitor i abl lot physic task no chest pain tachycardia morn around 110 1 hour less i return hospit holter monitor remov soon i return car heart start go crazi eveni chest pain back morn i fast puls rate 160180 3 hour row fast puls rate end afternoon i take normal bath same blood pressur it high whole month especi diastol number around 15095110 seem low around 1105560 im quit worri also confus whi sudden blood pressur return low side i higher whole februari month is monitor much blood pressur puls rate i pay much attent when blood pressur high i feel bad think i heart attack stroke blood pressur slow i feel like i faint puls rate higher i feel bad also seem i feel time bad caus heart im littl bit frustrat caus holter monitor give normal result cardiologist call say i noth wrong but fact i lot weird thing happen heart sinc chest pain back pain numb left arm hand headach pulsat vein templ head time eye pain dizzi intoler physic exercis emotionn stress trigger superventricular tachycardia thing like of cours famili doc test clinic i saw last week find blood pressur puls rate weird took puls rate i stand ask exercis offic take puls rate 1 minut puls rate 70 jump 168 minim physic exercis im sit i stand i big differ puls rate well blood pressur tend lower blood pressur im stand im sit sometim i wonder klonopin xanax lead weird symptom im anxious i link food fact blood pressur puls rate high low that like obsess i bare eat caus i fear bad reaction food i eat i also loos 21 pound less 2 month wonder for exampl everyth calcium increas blood pressur reduc puls rate fruit veget tend make sick intestin pain bloat chest pain decreas blood pressur bread pasta rice tend increas blood pressur but also lower i fear take vitamin i need daili caus gastric bypass surgeri i loos weight year ago iron pill increas blood pressur vitamin d decreas calcium pill increas or lower vitamin a tend increas i give betablock i tri acebutolol 3 time bad reaction i inder pill sinc one month i use take 255 mg inder i superventricular tachycardia reduc littl bit puls rate make lot anxious caus low blood pressur i low systol number i dont know mno differ diastol number famili doc rx anoth betablock last week call atenolol i tri 2 time felt bad also wors inder it like adren gland cant toler low dose betablock anyway im tire situat i fear get bed morn caus heart alway race daytim puls rate increas decreas time normal normal puls rate normal caus alway high low i cant fall asleep night nap daytim even i feel complet exhaust strang caus decemb januari i sleep 8 hour row long nap daytim without problem i take remeron low dose 3 mg maximum bedtim abl fall asleep 3 mg remeron dont affect adrenalin releas begin effect dont want increas dosag 3 mg caus i dont want adrenalin receptor touch what my therapist dont seem know right thank support
956,Atenolol+hypertension,This discussion is related to Develop rapid heart rate while sleeping. I am sorry that I am glad to hear of other folks with exactly my experience. My doctor suggested that I may be suffering from sleep apenia whereby my oxygen levels are reduced to a level while I'm asleep; that triggers a systemic panic response that results in the racing heart and panic attacks that I've been having at night. I have now completed two sleep studies and have be diagnosed with severe sleep apenia. I also read more on the health effects of sleep apenia and found that it's related to high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; and other cardiac issues. I am starting using my CPAP machine tonight; ironically enough. I'll let you all know how it goes with my heart racing/panic attacks.

957,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've experienced 3 episodes of tachycardia while sleeping in the last week. I feel a fluttery feeling in my chest with a ""burst"" of tachycardia causing my heart rate to peak at 140 BPM for approx 3-4 minutes. My doctor placed me on a 48 hr holter monitor (wasn't able to catch any of the episodes; of course) and the results were PVC's and sinus tachycardia which my doctor says are benign. She's ordered a stress test to cover all bases and told me that if the stress test is normal she wasn't going to worry about. By the way; I have suffered from panic disorder and lived med free up until Nov 99. I've been on 20 mgs of Paxil.

Both said that nothing was wrong. The doctor thinks that my heart is ""nervous"" I have had to deal with anxiety spells and depression after the birth of my second child. I am no longer on any antidepressants and I feel that I am not bad enough to take them any longer. For the past couple of weeks I have noticed an increase in the palpitations and skipping. It is now every day and it occurs alot during the day. I was just wondering could it be the pregnancy or is something else going on now.

959,Atenolol+hypertension,"I had my cardiology appt ; consulatation today for first time and now I am more confused than ever. Why is it that dr.s can not agree on tests results; etc? After my apparent heart attack early April; Severe squeezing pain to mid chest; pain to jaw; sweating; nausea; rise in blood pressure; feeling faint; feeling of impending doom; lasted about 15 minutes; went home.not to E.R. ( big mistake.) has stress test May 12; 08 Test was given a Persantine injection ; since I can not use the tread mill; allso radioactive dye to take pictures of heart. The test showed what is called REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT; THE REVERSE PERFUSION DEFECT N THE INFEROSEPTAL REGION AND THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOKINESIS OF THE SEPTUM AND INFERIOR SPETUM NEAR CARDIAC APEX. AND MID CARDIAC SEGMENT. THIS AREA DOES NOT PERFUSE NORMALLY ON STRESS IMAGING;. THE SIGNIFICENCE OF A PARADOXICAL PERFUSION DEFECT VARIES BUT THIS CONDITION MAY OCCUR WITH A RECENT MI. PARTICUARY AFTER REVASCULARIZATION OR THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY.CLINICAL CORRELATION IS ADVISED. My dr. accepted this as the result of my chest pain episode in april; all the classic symp. of a MI. The dr. forums here; Clevleand Clinic advised that is sounds as if I did indeed have a MI; though mayby a lilttle one; and that I would possibly need an echocardigram with left heart catherization and hopefully the Myocardium was only stunned and still alive. Now the Cardiologist I saw today didnt neccesary think the same thing; he said there are lots of reasons for Chest pain; but could not specify one; ( I don't have heartburn; indigestion; panic attacks; pleurisy; pneumonia; chest muscle pain or pulled muscle; gallstones or stomache pain; these are the obvious ones. ) I think one thing that threw him off was the fact that my chest pain episodes do not have any particualr pattern; and occur at any time of the day without exercise stressors. I get squeezing tightness in chest; burning pain in my throat; shortness of breath; nausea ; faint feeling; rise in blood pressure and heart rate; and fear. Need to sit down. The nurse even said; ' don't call them Angina."" I don't know what else to call them as I have never had them before this MI ( feeling...) in April. I can not predict when they will occur. The nurse allso considered my blood pressure of 148/84 ( normal and good ) after taking my blood pressure pill????Anyway; the dr. decided to do the Cardiac Catherization to rule out once and for all what I have or don't have going on with my heart. Are all dr. s this hard to get an opinion ; why do dr. s disagree so much? Has anyone else out there had a reverse Perfusion Defect on their Stress test? I feel so frustrated. I don't know what to think. Is it allways so hard to diagnose problems like this? If I would have gone to the E.R. I would not be having this problem now. There is a part of me that wishes I would have an attack in front of a dr. so I can get a diagnosis. It should not be like that.

960,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Kitlyn. I was just wondering if you were still out there and saw my post in response to yours under my page on Dysautonomia?? If you truly want to seek help; post to Ryan (RCA619) on the Anxiety Support Forum. I also have an entire topic discussing the problems and the results from the neurologist/physiologist there. Ryan has helped me to open my eyes to the possibility that I am not suffering from anxiety only; and particularly due to my reaction to the SSRI meds. he recommended that I may have some varient of dysautonomia and to get checked for it. If you haven't already; please check out the topic there; or start your own topic so Ryan (RCA) and I can further assist you.

962,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am an obese 51-year old female who has always had a relatively low BP (90/60 to 100/70) and a fast resting pulse (about 100) and respiration (about 25/min). This was true when I was a teenager and it stayed the same even with aging and a weight gain of about 90 lbs. When I exercised; my pulse always went way up--I was permanently forbidden to come to an aerobics class when I was in my 30's because my pulse had gone up to 220 (the instructor took it herself because she didn't believe me) during the routine exercises. On exertion; it was often about 180; but I got used to it and my doctors never paid any attention since I felt fine. 2 years ago I had an attack of atrial fibrillation that no one could explain. Since everything was fine on the echogram and the exercise test went OK; although they mentioned that they couldn't use the machine's program because my starting rate had been above 100 and it went up to 230 with no problems; they let me quit the meds and I had no trouble until this April. In an extreme emergency situation where I was in charge; I suddenly felt weird; everything greyed out; my head felt like exploding; and I felt like I had a blood pressure cuff on my left arm too tight. My BP (after the crisis) was still 150/110 and since that day; I have had high diastolic BP (about 135/95); ankle swelling; and some exertional dyspnea. Soon after the emergency; I had minor surgery and the anesthetist couldn't control my heart during the procedure. I went into a-fib again; and so I was put on a tiny dose of atenolol (25 mg a day in divided dose) and lanoxin (0.125 mg/day). Even this little bit of atenolol knocked me out--for 5 months I felt sick and exhausted and had horrible nightmares; but my BP and pulse were ""normal"" though I felt like I was going to faint if I even went upstairs because my CO was only about 3.5-4 and wouldn't go up when I needed to run; etc. They took me off it (kept the lanoxin) and I feel fine again; but now the BP is back up and the resting heart rate is about 115. Nothing evil shows up on the EKG; and the echogram only shows some trivial valve changes that the doctor said he couldn't have measured with the machine he had last year; but were probably always there. There is a little diastolic dysfunction; but again he says it is so tiny that it should not be doing anything. He is going nuts about the heart rate; even though I tell him it has been like that all my life. He says I must have inappropriate sinus tachycardia and should be treated for it; but I still wonder if I didn't have some kind of heart episode that day in April and maybe some damage that doesn't show up on the echogram. Is this possible? Can a person have a tiny infarct that zaps the sinus node or something? Is my heart just finally giving in to overweight and inactivity?? I hate to have him fry me unnecessarily and probably to no avail. I know you can't diagnose over the Net; but I'm just wondering what the possibilities are and how to test for them.

963,Atenolol+hypertension,"I thought I'd start a thread to document my withdrawal from Effexor due to the multitudionous threads elsewhere worrying about it. First of all I am a 12 stepping recovering alcoholic (dry since Apr 5th 2011). I am not an evangelist about these things but I know its working for me. I live in the UK I am not very good with the 12 step thing - but I am getting there. Second; I have been on Effexor for several years - max 75mg - currently on 37.5 mg generic - and the manufacturer of the month is ..... TEVA (they vary). I also take 37.mg atenolol (beta blocker) for anxiety / blood pressure. I have been on sertraline in the past ( bad experience for me >10 years ago ) and Prozac (about 10 years ago - good for me) and more recently Effexor. I take ADs for GAD (generalized anxiety). I want to get off the Effexor because I want to try things the 12 step way and because of its perceived dependency. I tried to cold turkey Effexor about 4 years ago and it was disasterous - I went into some kind of rebound depression as the say; got the brain zaps; felt flu-ey; extremely irritable; nauseous and disassociated; brain foggy. Basically very very sh*t. It almost cost me my relationship - along with my alcoholism - and the fact that when I was withdrawing I told my wife I dont know if I loved her any more (we were having financial and consequently relationship problems at the time) has caused lasting damage - which I am hopefully continuing to repair. Even though it was a lot to do ith the withdrawal the damage was done. Here are some of my symptoms which contributed to the above and still trouble me. Lack of sex drive - I feel I ""cant be bothered"" or have no energy - this hurts my wife a lot - she thinks its her. Fuzzy/Foggy brain. Poor quality sleep ( I also have sleep apnoea which is treated with CPAP and is just fine according to my latest check up). Muscular tension/tension headaches Hyperchondriasis Impatience. Lack of focus/concentration. Mood swings. Wake up very early and tired (getting to sleep is quite easy now Ive quit the booze) Also I am fat now - a fat beer bellied ******* with a 45"" belly on a much more slender frame. etc The truth is I dont know which ones are me and which ones are the Efffexor - if any. The truth is the Effxor helped in the beginning; but now I am trying to unmsk my true symptoms and deal with them a different way. Since I stopped drinking a lot of symptoms have eased; but of course dependent alcohlics get withdrawal too. So I have been dealing with the alcohol withdrawal symptoms for 3 months and now after 100 days (On Thursday) and I am moving on to the next thing. So I have several 100 day plans; as I call them. 1) Effexor. 2) Lose my belly 3) Stop smoking 4) Become RULER OF THE WORLD ... erm no .. that should say ""curb my meglomanical tendencies"" - or is that the Effexor ;) Of course AA says ""Easy does it"" - but like I said I am a bit impatient; but will listen to my body. I could go on and on - but I think that is sufficient background for now. Anyway; day one was Sunday 10th July - I took half a tablet (37.5mg/2 = 17.75mg). Yeterday Monday July 11th I took the same - maybe I felt a little odd on the dose reduction - maybe it was psychosomatic . I am going to continue on the 1/2 tablets for a week or two to see if there are any adverse or postive effects. I shall report when I make any changes or feel different otherwise it will be at weekends. I know this Effexor withdrawal stuff is different for a most of us; but if this helps one single person then I shall be a happier pig for it. If anyone wants to ask me stuff then feel free.

964,Atenolol+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52.0,Female,ill tri write novel get point im healthi woman 52 yrs i health issu healthi heart chad score 0 bp nice low 10060 dont smoke drink anymor big trigger etc etc after ablat pvcs i develop afib i wonder high profil cardiologist boston perform ablat he put flecainid work 75mgday 50mgday metoprolol it work first blip but i start frighten episod svt brought er eventu hospit he took flecainid seem caus svt i also atrial flutter i cardiovers still afib heart rate high im event monitor report doctor heart rate 150 last night i slept he put 100mg metoprolol ill take 2nd dose 50mg minut he want brand name toprol xl pharmaci hard time stock right im regular extend releas version take pm ok done background here issu ive onlin read page page page peopl taken side effect dosag report scare tear everyth hair thin huge weight gain im somewhat overweight last thing i need sleepless extrem exhaust depress sweat zero libido worsen afib goe honest im upset frighten i knew i shouldnt gone onlin read stuff i im shock preval advers side effect i feel like im go becom chronic unhealthi person begin end healthi year oh one thing i read imposs lose weight metoprolol slow heart unabl burn fat even ton work this stink soon monitor come i plan start work lose excess weight i went er heart rate 200 bp still perfect i told kind phenomen heart muscl obvious strong id like keep way ani thought
965,Atenolol+hypertension,"I wrote once before. I was having a fast heartrate that was waking me up in the middle of the night/early morning hours. It scared me because my father was diagnosed with an arrhythmia and hypertension at 50 (though he was overweight; a smoker; and an alcoholic). I am 26 and in fairly good shape. My blood pressure is normal (or it was a few months ago)- slightly high at the doctor 130-138/70. The Holter was normal with a few extra ""skipped beats"" and a couple PVCs which I don't get very often. Echo was normal. I had an event monitor and everything I recorded was ""fast; but normal- not SVT"". I know that I have anxiety about this now; and I have been having a few panic attacks. But; if I don't ""freak out"" when it is going on this is what happens- I wake up and my heart is beating fast (probably 90bpm) then when I move it jumps up faster for a few seconds- then it pounds for a few seconds- with a noticable sinus arrhythmia; then it settles back to normal; but not as slow as my normal resting rate. My resting heartrate is normally about 53bpm. If I do panic it beats fast for 10 minutes or so. I have noticed that the night before it happens- I feel ""reved up""- but not in a good way. It feels like there is electricity going through the pit of my stomach. I have a theory that it might be sugar related- could this be true? Maybe hormones? I have had migraines all my life.

966,Atenolol+hypertension,"I'm 37;excellent health;used to exercise-running 3-4.5 mi./day 3-4X/wk until I had an episode of freq. PVC(3-5/min)after I was 1 mi. into my run one day several wks ago. I've had PVCs since my mid-20s. I've had 4 echos since(stress echo 9/03);holter monitor 3X(last 9/03);and event monitor for 2 wks.

967,Atenolol+hypertension,Thank you doctors for participating on this board. I have my annual check-up with my cardio in a few weeks (actually it's been almost two years since I last saw him) and want this appointment to be productive. My first check-up lasted only about 15 minutes and I left feeling kind of disappointed. I would like your advice on what kind of questions and issues I should be bringing up (especially if he doesn't). My story: 55 yr. old male; afib for four years; occurrences start almost always at night in bed; usually terminated via some physical activity like long walks; tennis; etc.; episodes average 12-14 hrs.; twice a week; am taking metoprolol 25 mg. daily in two 12 1/2 pills (I cut up a 50 mg. pill into quarters) late morning and late afternoon; also take a baby aspirin daily; and no coumadin because I'm not 75 yet (because of my frequency and length; do you think coumadin is indicated?). I reduced the dosage because I read where vagal afibbers like myself should not be taking beta-blockers. Your opinion on this? Here's something interesting; I was only averaging a few hours per episode until I tried accupuncture about a year and a half ago and immediately; my episodes shot up to 10 hrs. plus. Maybe a coincidence but any effects from that accupuncture should be gone by now - but the frequency and duration are still here. Am also taking a host of supplements per stuff I've learned about like magnesium; fish oil; taurine; co-enzyme 10; etc. What suggestions do you have as to potential talking points? And how often are echos or stress tests done?

970,Atenolol+hypertension,I am 35 and three weeks ago I began having PVCs while lifting weights. I run too; but I don't suffer from any irregularities when doing that. It seems that the higher the heart rate the lower the occurance. I had a stress echo a week ago and everything was normal and that's when they diagnosed that I am having PVCs. I was wondering these three things. First; what could cause this situation from happening out of the blue? Second; could it go away just as quickly as it came? Last; is there any other tests that you would recommend to make sure that there is no problem with my heart? Thank you.,2003,2004,,,i 35 three week ago i began pvcs lift weight i run i dont suffer irregular it seem higher heart rate lower occur i stress echo week ago everyth normal that diagnos i pvcs i wonder three thing first could caus situat happen blue second could go away quick came last test would recommend make sure problem heart thank

972,Atenolol+hypertension,"I had a heart attack on Jan 15;... I am a 42 year old male who doesn't smoke; isn't overweight; has normal blood pressure; low cholesterol; (including quite low hdl which is a problem; apparently) and no previous heart problems or any other health problems. I have been exercising for years. My angiogram says that I have ""100% occlusion of the anterior descending artery with collaterals from the left and right. 25% stenosis in mid circumflex 25% stenosis in distal right coronary artery Conclusions: Single vessel coronary artery disease. Grade II left ventricular function with anterolateral apical wall hypokinesis. I have been told to go home for 2 months and that; if I experience angina during routine activities; bypass surgery may be my solution. I have adopted a 10% plant based diet (Ornish; Esselstyn); and am hoping that this along with proper exercise; and rest; will make bypass surgery unnecessary. What I'm hoping is that the collateral circulation will continue to improve enough to restore the previous circulation equal to what my blocked artery could have provided.... Is this naive?.... or should I resign myself to bypass surgery? I only experience chest pain during exercise stress tests...not during routine activities....one lab technician; says that is not unusual considering how recent my heart attack was; and should improve naturally as my heart heals in the next few months....Is this a fair statement? I have also heard that one of the side effects of bypass surgery is a minor amount of brain damage.... this apparently being discussed in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year... thoughts on this? thanks in advance for your response.

973,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; My doc thinks I may have developed a collagen vascular disease 2 yrs. ago. I have many symptoms since: raynauds (diagnosed); overall cold intolerance; digestive problems; swallowing discomfort & esophagus spasms; etc. I also have cardiovascular symptoms: For 1+ years have had SOB on exertion (or at night); pounding heart and elevated pulse after exercise or eating; & increasing palpitations. Tests done: 4 echos; event monitor(EM); stress tests; EKG's; PFT's; lung CT-scans; & right-heart cath. due to suspected pulmonary hypertension (results normal). Abnormalities from above tests: 1)EM showed short bursts (5-15 seconds) of sinus tachycardia & SVT's. The palpitations are quick to start & quick to end seemingly with no trigger. 2)The RHC showed a high cardiac output (7.83) & high venous saturations. 3)Two echos showed apical & apical-lateral hypokinesis but later echos showed none. 4)My last PFT's were at 75% diffusion. I started Toprol-XL which has slowed heart & helped some with palp's. & helped with exercise - but more snorting at night. Questions: 1)Is there any significance to having BOTH sinus tach & SVT's? 2)Doc tells me not to worry about the SVT's but some of your information says they can be dangerous - is this true? 3)If my blood vessels are constricted in my body; could my heart be trying to compensate? 4)Since I have 2 kinds of SVT arrythmias -is there increased chances for VT? 5)Two echos at same clinic six months apart showed heart heart size increase but doc says this is due to test error - sound right?; 6)Where do I go from here?

974,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 43 year old female who is in good health.Since October I have been dealing with palps; they drive me crazy. I have had a holter; echocardiogram and tests came back normal other than pac's; sinus tach.The past couple of weeks have been horrible I will begin my episodes around 4:30 pm and they will last until bedtime. When they hit they will come every 2-3 minutes feels like my heart is jumping out of my chest very distrubing. I saw my doctor on Monday and he drew blood again and ordered an event monitor. I wore it Friday events started at 5pm and I filled the monitor up by 9pm. I will be able to call it in Monday at 9am. I currently take a beta blocker; and also meds for panic attacks.My dad has atrial fib and that always concerns me that I am heading in that direction.I also have very low blood pressure 80/55.I also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis but the endo doc does not feel my numbers are abnormal; so I am not on thyroid medication. Questions??? Do you think it is atrial fib??? My heart rate does speed up a bit when these hit; but not much. Just seems to jump every few minutes or so. Would my low blood pressure cause the palps; I take 25 to 50 mg of atenlol per day. Only take 50 if they really get bad. Is it anxiety or my heart?? With my dad's history I just wonder. This is something new that I have never experienced in my years with panic disorder. What tests do I need but haven't had???? I appreciate your time! Would love to hear from others who are bothered by these darn things.

975,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi there and thanks very much for taking my question. I am a 36-year-old woman. For the best part of the last year I have been suffering constant and frequent skipped heartbeats. It all seemed to start when I decided it was time I started to take regular exercise. Prior to that I used to get a very big PVC only once every two months or so. But now I seem to get around two to four a minute. They are stronger at the end of the day. They are very typical of other people's PVC's: an uncomfortable and annoying feeling of something flipping over in my chest. I don't get breathless or feel pain or anything like that; but sometimes there is a bit of a ""rush"". My father has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I had a scan for HCM about ten years ago and was told I was clear; though a small murmur was detected. I really don't want to give up exercise: I can't believe that it's bad for me... I don't have any particular stress in my life and haven't drunk caffeine for over a year. Also I drink alcohol in extreme moderation. I keep thinking I ought to go and see my physician and get myself checked out; but haven't quite got around to it yet - mostly because everything I read seems to point to asymptomatic PVC's not being dangerous in most cases. Is it worth getting myself checked out? The PVC's are annoying; but I don't want to take any drugs if I can help it. I would rather just live with it. Also; I'm interested in getting a cosmetic surgery procedure done which would necessitate a general anesthetic. Would the PVC's present any problem? Thanks so much Kate",2004,2004,,,hi thank much take question i 36yearold woman for best part last year i suffer constant frequent skip heartbeat it seem start i decid time i start take regular exercis prior i use get big pvc everi two month but i seem get around two four minut they stronger end day they typic peopl pvcs uncomfort annoy feel someth flip chest i dont get breathless feel pain anyth like sometim bit rush my father hypertroph cardiomyopathi i scan hcm ten year ago told i clear though small murmur detect i realli dont want give exercis i cant believ bad i dont particular stress life havent drunk caffein year also i drink alcohol extrem moder i keep think i ought go see physician get check havent quit got around yet most everyth i read seem point asymptomat pvcs danger case is worth get check the pvcs annoy i dont want take drug i help i would rather live also im interest get cosmet surgeri procedur done would necessit general anesthet would pvcs present problem thank much kate
976,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 31 female; overweight but not extreme; non smoker. I have been living with PVCs since I was a teenager; but had them diagnosed in 99. I stopped with caffinated beverages and that helped tremendously. Well for the past month or so; they have been occuring on a more regular basis. I know; I know that they won't kill me BUT. Friday evening I had taken benadhryl for sinuses (dr told me it was the only medication I could take) and had a horrible reaction. I had a strange hot sensation of blood raging from the tips of my fingers to the tips of my toes. SO we go to the ER. The RN there told me that his wife had PVCs and that I was fine; put me on an EKG and everything was normal once my heart rate calmed down (that happened after he told me I wouldln't die) Major problem here??? I am having strange sensations when I try to go to sleep. Kind of like the pvcs but more of a almost fainting sensation. Has anyone ever felt this? Is this strange? I am planning on seeing a dr asap just to make sure everything is OK (never had the heart monitor on for more than 20 minutes). I am wondering if this is just me in a panic over my heart.. Yes I do have a stressful job/life and I paln on discussing that with the doctor too. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can share.

977,Atenolol+hypertension,I have had numerous bouts recently with atrial Fib And have been in to see my physician. My physical went very well but he did detect a slight murmur and said I have a breathing arythmia. Meaning when I breathe my heart rate slow and speeds up! I have had an appointment with a cardiologist and he listened to me and thought it was a benign sort of thing! I am having a holter monitor put on tomorrow for 24 hrs. and thursday I'll have an echocardiogram done. My symptoms are sometimes a fast heart rate for me 90-100bpm..maybe 110. I experience missed beats or a pause in beats..right as I write this I'm getting 2-3 pauses per minute or so. I get tingling sensations in my arms and upper chest area. The feeling is scary as it happens alot at bedtime feeling a little like tightness or a muscle tightening in my left shoulder in the front. I have been able to put up with these episodes but they really bother me and sleeping is almost impossible.Can sleep deprivation make these worse? I have stopped all caffiene and alcohol...but still continue to have these almost daily..maybe more than once daily. What do you think I should do if all the tests come out negative? Should I proceed with more tests? Thanks for any input you can give me..,1999,1999,,,i numer bout recent atrial fib and see physician my physic went well detect slight murmur said i breath arythmia mean i breath heart rate slow speed i appoint cardiologist listen thought benign sort thing i holter monitor put tomorrow 24 hrs thursday ill echocardiogram done my symptom sometim fast heart rate 90100bpmmayb 110 i experi miss beat paus beatsright i write im get 23 paus per minut i get tingl sensat arm upper chest area the feel scari happen alot bedtim feel littl like tight muscl tighten left shoulder front i abl put episod realli bother sleep almost impossiblecan sleep depriv make wors i stop caffien alcoholbut still continu almost dailymayb daili what think i test come negat should i proceed test thank input give
978,Atenolol+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me. Could you recommend anything. I am hanging by a thread. Thanks.,2001,2001,,,i suffer sever anxieti pvcs i year would think i would get use i tri buspar gave headach tri paxil made pvcs wors i also tri beta blocker calcium channel blocker didnt seem help much either beta blocker gave terribl headach well i think i natur low blood pressur anyway doctor say dont worri palpit late i terrifi no amount pacifi ep doctor famili physican make stop worri i would like know recommend antianxieti med person could go would affect heart way is normal sever anxieti i actual avoid situat i around peopl fear heart skip i also sleep night i feel heart skip sometim everi third beat send panic i constant butterfli stomach i cant stand feel pvcs these darn thing taken complet control life my doctor loss could recommend anyth i hang thread thank
979,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello doc and thanks for taking my question. When I first found this site I was amazed at the number of people who share symptoms very similar to mine with no clear answer. There is a thread in the Family Practice forum with about 25 different people discussing mysterious head pressure. I appeal to you please to help us find an answer; I lost a good job in the airline industry and my friends and family have given up on me; and I've had to switch doctors 3 times due to them trying to psycho-analyze me and basically ridicule me; since my MRI was negative but I still insist there must be an explanation. I have seen a top University neurologist who specialty is headaches; plus another neuro. I woke up with day with an intense pressure deep in my head; extend to top of head and at eyebrows level. waves of anxiety; dizzy; nausea begin at same time. One clue seem to be a ""trickeling"" or ""squishing"" sound when I stretch my neck out or move my head around. If I extend my head upward and hold it stretched (like giraffe neck) and the sound happens I get temporarily great relief from the pressure...I must hold my head in the extended position to maintain relief but when I relax it comes right back. I can 99.9% say this sound is connected to symptoms because there is occasional day when pain/pressure is less and this squishing sound is hardly present. I was wondering first do you think my CSF could be somehow being blocked or slowed between cranium and neck (hence squishing sound) or perhaps poor blood circulation?

981,Atenolol+hypertension,"Thank you for creating this forum. I know it is comforting to many. Heart arrhythmias are terrifying; as anyone who suffers from them knows. In my case; I've had PVC's and a mild case of MVP for years. However; I've NEVER had heart ""palpitations"" like those I've been experiencing in the past few weeks. I'm 47 years old; nearly 48...and peri-menopausal...(not fun!) I discovered that I was anemic a few months ago...blood count 9.8; so I started taking iron. I noticed an increase in PVC's around that time; and was so tired. Anyway; as my blood count went up; the PVC's increased instead of dissipated. Finally; a week and a half ago; they turned into bigimeny; which I have never had before...and which scared me to pieces! I ended up in the ER. Anyway; they did a CT to check for blood clots in my lungs; which was negative. I had had a thyroid check and electrolytes the week before...all normal. Well; my cardiologist seems to feel no sense of urgency in seeing me now. I already had an appt. for May 4 (before the ER incident); and he refused to see me any sooner afterward. I haven't seen him in six years; and the very first thing he wants to do is a stress echo test; without even doing an EKG or a holter monitor...or an exam. I tried to see another doctor; but no one in town will see me without a referral; and certainly not sooner than May 4. I have been very sendentary and exhausted with the anemia; and am afraid to do the stress test. I just want to know what is causing my problem!! Could it be hormonal? Is my doctor doing the right thing?

982,Atenolol+hypertension,hi; I'm a 23 year old male in perfect health. i have seen 8 electrophysiologists one being second opinion from cleveland clinic since Nov. 05 and have had; 2 echos; 1 cardiac MRI; 2 stress tests; 3 holter monitors; and blood work; all tests came back normal. the holter monitor was the only tests that picked up PVC's and PAC's. the holters have picked up at the most 300 PVC's 900 PAC's and the least 3 PVC's and 98 PAC's. all this started after dieting and (ephedra free) diet pills. My questions are 1. my fear is that my PVC's will get worse as i get older and i will develop CM; it fears me more because of my age and that i have these now. do you see this happening in my case? 2. my PVC's seem to scare me more when i am aware of my heart especially during exercise or sex (seems to be when they occur more) so i've avoided these activities and that makes me fell bad that i have to avoid those things especially because of my age. besides the discomfort these cause; while i'm doing these activities does it matter if the PVC's come in groups or singles? 3. i'm on sectral (acebutolol) and all my doctors want to see me get off this medication within the next 3 months. is it true that sectral is the only beta blocker with the ability to surpress PVC's; it fears me to get off of them if they are acually supressing them and yet at my age i don't want to rely on a pill? thank you for your time!,2006,2006,,,hi im 23 year old male perfect health seen 8 electrophysiologist one second opinion cleveland clinic sinc nov 05 2 echo 1 cardiac mri 2 stress test 3 holter monitor blood work test came back normal holter monitor test pick pvcs pac holter pick 300 pvcs 900 pac least 3 pvcs 98 pac start diet ephedra free diet pill my question 1 fear pvcs get wors get older develop cm fear age see happen case 2 pvcs seem scare awar heart especi exercis sex seem occur ive avoid activ make fell bad avoid thing especi age besid discomfort caus im activ matter pvcs come group singl 3 im sectral acebutolol doctor want see get medic within next 3 month true sectral beta blocker abil surpress pvcs fear get acual supress yet age dont want reli pill thank time

984,Atenolol+hypertension,"I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; ""Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis""; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record.

985,Atenolol+hypertension,This started last year. I woke up extremely dizzy; headache and had trouble speaking. Lasted about 4 hours. My eyes were not reacting to light. Months later; while at work I would be sitting and get dizzy out of clear blue. Co-workers often said I was slurring my words; which I was not aware of. Lately I have been waking up dizzy at least 4 times a week; lasting now two weeks. I am nauseated; feel pressure in back of my head; balance is quite off; blurred vision. I have had an MRI; which was normal; A stress EKG; where the EKG was non-conclusive; and the scan showed okay. I have Hasimotos disease; High Blood pressure; extreme Vitamin D defiency; and am taking 50;000ui daily; to have blood checked on June 29th. I currently take Lisinopril 20-25; Atenolol 50; Synthroid ;175; and I have sleep apnea; a Herniated lumbar disk at L3/L4-5. I have involuntary muscle spasms that affect mostly upper body; but sometimes lower extremities as well. I go back to doctor on 29th; and I need to know what to ask for in the way of more testing; because this is beginning to interfere in my daily activities.

986,Atenolol+hypertension,": Dear Doctor; : I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on ""spectral"" and ""verapimil"". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side.

987,Atenolol+hypertension,"I referred to your August 20; 1998 posting in the archives regarding a definition of right-sided heart failure. Your definition and diagnostic procedures agree with that of several physicians regarding my condition during the past year. My medications are atenolol; isordil; valsartan; furosemide; aspirin; premarin; and a multivitamin. On Thanksgiving morning I awoke to symptoms of very rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; extreme fatigue and more fluid retension than usual although I had been monitoring my salt intake very carefully. The symptoms resolved in about 4 hours; however since then the least exertion causes rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. My family physician diagnosed right-sided heart failure with hepatimegaly and referred me to a cardiologist. Since I am new in this city and don't know the reputation of the cardiologists here; I took my physician's word that this person was the very best the city had to offer. When I went to see him; though; I became very confused. After listening to my heart (which has a murmur; by the way) and ordering an echo; the cardiologist told me that my bicuspid valve was leaking; my EF was 55%; I did not have ""conventional"" heart failure; my heart was essentially normal; and that if I had heart failure at all it was ""ischemic."" I also do not have any signs of pulmonary hypertension. Then he went on to say that I had CAD (which I already knew). He ordered a heart cath to be done in a couple of weeks and said that if he was right; a blocked artery was causing my heart failure. When it was repaired I would never have trouble with heart failure again. With all my reading here; on the internet; and some material from my physicians in the past year; I was led to believe that heart failure was irreversible. So here are my confused questions: Whom do I believe? How can a blocked artery cause heart failure no matter which side it is on? Do I really have an excellent prognosis? Is it as simple as repairing a blocked artery; or is it more involved than that? Please help me. I don't know what to think anymore.

988,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Robin on June 19; 1999 at 12:07:01 I am 34yr. old female and have been diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy. I am currently taking 20mg. of monopril(10mg 2 x day); 50mg of atenolol 1 x a day; 20mg. lasix as needed; asprin 325mg. a day; and xanax as needed. My problem and questions are about the monopril. My doseage was increased to 20mg. in march.I had been feeling ok except for about the past month I have been experiencing periods of dizziness; nausia; faint feeling; weakness; extreme fatigue; edema & tiredness. I had most of these before the increse only now they are more prominant. I recently started cardio rehab and on my first visit they wouldnt let me do much because my blood preasure would suddenly drop from abou 117/72 to about 78/60. They were on the phone with my cardiologist most of the time and they said he seemed to think it was no big deal. My preasure came up with activity. I was having one of my moderatly ""bad"" days that day. They advised me to monitor my preasure several times a day and to not exert myself outside of the rehab center. my next two visits I had no problems.The RN suggested that it was my monopril causing all this. QUESTION; 1 If meds are the cause; why do I only have symptoms some of the time? I can go weeks sometimes feeling good. QUESTION 2; do all ACE inhibs. have these affects? QU. 3; will exercise offset the side effects? I am no longer having the monster attacts of irregular heat beat( i still have mild ones) and arrythmias since taking the monopril and I dont want them to come back. But now I have other life altering symptoms. QU. 4; Will I ever feel normal again (havent in four years) or should I just except the fact that I am sick and there isnt much that can be done? I am hopeful rehab will help me feel better. Thank you soooo much for all the info. you supply on this board.

989,Atenolol+hypertension,"Posted By Terry Wichert on April 15; 1998 at 14:45:19: In Reply to: Cutting edge treatments for frequent PVC's posted by Terry Wichert on April 02; 1998 at 20:10:29: Dear Doctor; I am a 41 year old male on active duty in the US Navy. I am just returning home from one month of hospitalization. I was admitted because of atrial fibrillation (converted out with diltiazem) but when placed on sotalol I developed short runs of V-TAC (max duration was 33 beats at 166 bpm). Following my diagnosis of V-TAC; an EP study was performed on me (4 catheters; 5 hours long) but V-TAC could not be induced during the EP study so no ablation was performed. I was sent home on ""spectral"" and ""verapimil"". I have since discontinued the verapimil because the combination caused near continuous palpitations. One more piece of history then to my question. I have had for the last year a lot of PVCs (some days 5;000-10;000). They are almost always continuous (every other beat) when I walk or lay on my left side. My cardioligist has told me to ignore them; but I find this nearly impossible.

Wichert 801 Date Drive Pearl City; HI 96782 or e-mail me at ***@****. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply. Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it. Since I am asymptomatic and convert out on my own; my cardioligist has diagnosed my VTAC as ""non-sustained"". He also believes that it is RVOT VTAC (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract) I believe. I hope this info helps. I am still mostly interested in solving the PVC problem. You can reply again in this forum. Thank you so much for this wonderful service you have provided and don't worry about the timliness of the last answer. I am more intereste in a thorough and helpful response than a quick one.

990,Atenolol+hypertension,"I can't help but notice since I joined this community some months ago; people with skipped beats or palpitations tend to ask questions about PVCs. Like all flips in the chest are PVCs. The upper chambers in the heart are more ""irritable"" than the main chambers. In other words; they are more likely to produce premature beats (PACs). A few examples: Which is more common - A-fib (atrial) or V-fib (ventricular)? Which is more common - SVT (atrial) or VT (V-tach) (ventricular)? Both PACs and PVCs are usually benign; so it's really not an issue; I was just a little curious. Even so-called ""wide complex beats"" on EKG are often PACs. If a PAC occurs very early; it can show as a wide complex on EKG; because the right ventricle is a little slower recovering than the left; leading the electricity to the left ventricle; and then to the right; thus mimic a PVC that origin in the left ventricle. Just so you know :-)",2009,2010,28.0,Male,i cant help notic sinc i join communiti month ago peopl skip beat palpit tend ask question pvcs like flip chest pvcs the upper chamber heart irrit main chamber in word like produc prematur beat pac a exampl which common afib atrial vfib ventricular which common svt atrial vt vtach ventricular both pac pvcs usual benign realli issu i littl curious even socal wide complex beat ekg often pac if pac occur earli show wide complex ekg right ventricl littl slower recov left lead electr left ventricl right thus mimic pvc origin left ventricl just know
991,Atenolol+hypertension,I'm a 29 year old male. I have HCM Cardiomyopathy with a case of Afib. My Afibs are brought on usually on a full stomach. I usually have afib encounters every couple years however they have been becoming closer and closer. I have has the past two episodes back to back this past month. In the span of only a week apart from each other and I have been noticing lately my body almost going into a fib depending on the position i'm laying in or bending over when on a full stomach. The palpitations do become stronger when on a full stomach. I have IBS which was diagnosed after an endoscopy;small Hietal Hernia and Helicobacter pylori. My GI told me that I just have a nervous stomach but DOES NOT believe that the Vagus nerve and what I'm feeling going into a fib to be related to IBS or H pylori? Something doesn't seem right and I feel like my heart these past couple weeks has been very susceptible to a fib.When I followed up with my Cardiologist i went through the routine visit; EKG; ECG; Monitor etc. and everything seems to check out fine. So I believe that something in my stomach is binging on these episodes of Afib. Im not sure if its indigestion. I have heard that GERD can cause triggers to flare up AFIB as it irritates the Vagus nerve. But once again my GI does not believe its that either. I need some opinions because he believes in more natural solutions to problems and it kind of irritates me because I know something is wrong and it's related to my stomach. I followed up with him yesterday evening and he told me to start antibiotics for H pylori infection and later that night after I ate I felt again like I was going to have another episode of afib. Does anyone have the same symptoms? I'm really looking for some answers as I can not go on with life like this. I'm getting married soon and I can not think to start a family with these problems over my head. I need to be a Superman for my kids one day.

992,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; Since a while I have some heart problems (POTS; dysautonomia; irregular heart rate aka tachycardia; low blood pressure OR high blood pressure). They are not well control by meds and my Cardio Doc seem to think it's only anxiety related with a physical deconditionning state and don'T offer a lot of support to me... A new symptom appear last february. I start having a pounding heart rate all the time even at rest. In fact; I feel my heart beat really HARD in my chest all the time; it's especially worse in the morning and late afternoon; after a nap in the afternoon; when I get up in the morning... At bedtime it's seem to calm down a little bit but I can't fall asleep cause of the constant pounding heart in my chest; I ear it and feel it all the time. I also don't sweat like in the past; I sweat mostly from hands and feet only. I feel like my head is hot all the time or seem to be intolerant to hot weater and temperature. Have to apply a cold compress on my head most of the time to reduce the hot sensation... it help at the same time for the chronic headache from the TMJ disorder that I also have. I take some Propranolol 10 mg x 3 a day; my dose was increase from 20mg to 30 mg but since it was increase last january;the only thing it's doing for my pounding heart rate and tachycardia is to lower even more my blood pressure and increasing my resting heart rate... I have severe anxiety not under control for now and the only time my blood pressure increase is when i'm out of the house; in a social situation or have to go to the dentist for example... and normally my distolic blood pressure number increase from 60 to 90 and the systolic increase from 100 to 130... I have a blood pressure machine at home; I take my blood pressure 3 times a day and find out that when my heart is pounding harder usually my blood pressure is in the low range; low for me is around 100/60; I had a normal blood pressure of 135/80 before I start having all those cardiovascular symptoms back in 2010... My pulse rate at rest is around 75 with the 30 mg dose of propranolol; without it it's about 100 at rest. The main problem is when I get up to walk and when I stay in a up position for a long time; my heart rate when I get up in the morning is about 130 sit at rest; when I get up it goes into the 160 and more. I can't exercise at all; will start a special exercise program for peoples who have heart diseases since my Cardio Doc think i'm in a physical deconditionning state... but I fear that attempting the gym to do the physical program will trigger another SVT attack or trigger more panic attack (usually have 1 to 5 panic attacks a day). My question is : I'm the only one here to feel my heart pounding in my chest all the time? I have another holter monitor 24 h test to be done in june; I can't see my Cardio Doc before having that test done. I need some advises about another med than the propranolol to control the tachycardia and reduce the pounding heart rate I feel all the time. Meds that I try so far are mostly all the beta-blocker; propranolol being the one with the less side-effects on me. I also try the Clonidine... Right now i'm on 7 mg of Klonopin a day with no effect on my anxiety at all... I'm also meds sensitive so that's why I can't start an antidepressant med to control my anxiety...

993,Atenolol+hypertension,hello i was diagnosed in 1995 with Graves disease. I drank radioactive iodine and after several attempts i got my thyroid under control with synthroid. Ive had to change my doses due to my test becoming abnormal or high again. I started out at .75 and now Im up to .175 per day. Well the recent test i had done 4 weeks ago said my TSH was 13. So they repeated it last week and now its 16. I am scared. I am confused as to why it keeps going up.

I know my weight is alot of my problem and these problems would go away with weight loss. But why does my TSH keep going up? What are my risks? Is this dangerously high? Why wont my doctor take time to talk to me. I am so worried. please help me. He is increasing my synthroid to .175 .. 7 days a week instead of 5 days a week with 2 days being only a half a tablet.

994,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello Doctor; I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hosting this forum; I've posted once before and have found it very informative and helpful; thank you! I have a few questions concerning PVC's & PAC's. I have been evaluted by two different cardiologists with a battery of tests and everthing is normal; noted 1/2 apical ejection (flow) murmur only (28 year old male; 5' 11""; 190LBS; athletic). 1. From what I understand now; PVC's & PAC's are not harmful; is either worse than the other? ie. more PVC's 2. Is the sensation of a skipped beat the result of an extra beat or is the sensation from the extra flow of blood resulting from a longer pause in the heart rythm? 3. If an individual is experiencing for example 1;000 PAC's/PVC's on a daily basis; does that signify an extra 1;000 beats? Wouldn't these extra beats over a span of an average life ""tire"" the heart muscle? 4. I notice in my resting pulse only (around 48-52BPM) that sometimes after relaxing from either a work-out or just normal activity that a few beats are longer apart then others; however this is pattern is repeatitive; meaning the longer pause are not totally random but will repeat after the same number of beats per minute. My question is what's considered and irregular to regular pulse? 5. From your experience with past and present patients; have you seen any individuals experiencing PVC's/PAC's every go away entirely? 6. Are they the cause of some part of SA/NA node's deteriating? 7.

995,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I was just released from a 4day detox from xanax's.The doctors in the center used valium to help with the withdrawl symptoms and I really felt pretty good throughout the 4 day stay.Well I have been home for 3 days and let me tell you...this is NO WALK IN THE PARK. I am very shaky; nervous and I have this very uncomfortable burning feeling in my legs and feet.Whats that about?????...I thought the worst was over.

996,Atenolol+hypertension,I am a 40 year old female; generally healthy and have bicuspid aortic valve. My last echo; 2 yrs ago noted stage 1 regurgitation. For the last week; I have had an increase in palpitations. I have them all day long and they are especially bad at night. The exact minute I lay flat they start going crazy. I don't think it's a case of noticing them more because it's quiet; etc. They are really more frequent and stronger. I have to sit up in order to slow them down and still then they keep on coming. I have noticed that I have a lot more heartburn lately. I have been taking Nexium 40 mg twice daily for about 4 years and somedays I still have heartburn. I am being very careful of what I eat. I haven't had caffeine in about 5 years. I don't exercise because these palpitations scare the stuff out of me and I can't make myself go to the gym. I was told to do cardio and only very light weights if I was going to do any weights at all. I had a bad bout of palps around Christmas and went to the ER they ran an EKG and I had LOTS of PAC's and only about 4 PVC's. The palpitations that week kind of settled down to a bearable amount and then last week; that was it. It started all over again. It's like a big vibration and then a thump. I don't know what to do. Is there something new going on? Is there a special test I should get? I don't want to go on a beta blocker because my BP is low and my heartrate during palps is around 64. What do I do next? I am so scared.,2003,2006,,,i 40 year old femal general healthi bicuspid aortic valv my last echo 2 yrs ago note stage 1 regurgit for last week i increas palpit i day long especi bad night the exact minut i lay flat start go crazi i dont think case notic quiet etc they realli frequent stronger i sit order slow still keep come i notic i lot heartburn late i take nexium 40 mg twice daili 4 year someday i still heartburn i care i eat i havent caffein 5 year i dont exercis palpit scare stuff i cant make go gym i told cardio light weight i go weight i bad bout palp around christma went er ran ekg i lot pac 4 pvcs the palpit week kind settl bearabl amount last week it start it like big vibrat thump i dont know is someth new go is special test i get i dont want go beta blocker bp low heartrat palp around 64 what i next i scare
997,Atenolol+hypertension,I am hoping to get some help on this problem I have had for about 3 years. I get a strange feeling in my chest like I could feel each heart beat in my chest and it is very bothersome. My heart is not skiping although I do get that palpatations at times also;but this is more like energy jumping around in my chest. This is an all day thing I get for days at a time. Sometimes it gets alot worse after eating a meal. My heart will feel like it is racing but most times if I take my pulse it is 72BPM but it FEELS much faster. I have been for every heart test(Holter; 30 day monitor; stress test; echo) and the only thing they found was an elongated mitral valve and trace regurgitation which they tell me both are nothing; is this true?? or could that be causing these feelings? Also If I am sitting still watching TV my eyes seem to flicker along with each heart beat. I now this sounds wierd and I am hoping you may have heard of this before but it's like every time my heart beats my eyes pulse. My blood pressure is not high at all so I dont know why that happens. I am 31 female; not overweight; non-smoker. I also have days where I feel out of breath and a rapid pulse just from walking up a flight of stairs and the very next day I feel fine walking up the same stairs. I really need to know whats going on any ideas....thanks so much and have a Happy Thanksgiving Jean :),2001,2002,,,i hope get help problem i 3 year i get strang feel chest like i could feel heart beat chest bothersom my heart skipe although i get palpat time alsobut like energi jump around chest this day thing i get day time sometim get alot wors eat meal my heart feel like race time i take puls 72bpm feel much faster i everi heart testholt 30 day monitor stress test echo thing found elong mitral valv trace regurgit tell noth true could caus feel also if i sit still watch tv eye seem flicker along heart beat i sound wierd i hope may heard like everi time heart beat eye puls my blood pressur high i dont know happen i 31 femal overweight nonsmok i also day i feel breath rapid puls walk flight stair next day i feel fine walk stair i realli need know what go ideasthank much happi thanksgiv jean
998,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello all! Am I ever glad I found this site. I'm a newbie but definately not new to these dang pvc's. I was wondering if anyone else has what I call ""positional pvc's""? By this I mean I can trigger them by lifting my right arm over my head; bending over; turning/twisting when only moving my upper chest; not turning my waist; reaching for things especially when reaching with my right arm over to the left side of my body. (Just seems to be my right arm) Even riding on a bumpy road can set them off which I think is very strange. Also with my last pregnancy; when the doc would have me lay on my back and she'd palpitate my belly it would set them off as well. Other things that trigger them are stretching while holding my breath; working on a burp that is stuck in my throat and talking without taking a breath. So basically anything can set them off! Just wondering if I'm the only weirdo here. If anyone else gets these ""positional pvc's"" please share.",2009,2009,,,hello am i ever glad i found site im newbi defin new dang pvcs i wonder anyon els i call posit pvcs by i mean i trigger lift right arm head bend turningtwist move upper chest turn waist reach thing especi reach right arm left side bodi just seem right arm even ride bumpi road set i think strang also last pregnanc doc would lay back shed palpit belli would set well other thing trigger stretch hold breath work burp stuck throat talk without take breath so basic anyth set just wonder im weirdo if anyon els get posit pvcs pleas share
999,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks to a doctor's answer to a previous post about my chest pain; my family dr. has diagnosed me with costochondritis and I am finally starting to feel better; however; in the past few weeks; I have begun to have some PVCs. Can stress cause PVCs to happen? My father died unexpectedly on Dec. 22 and both my brother and I have had episodes of PVCs (I am 31 and he is 29). I also had a baby 5 weeks before my father died; so I have been under some addition stress! We have never had PVCs before. The only reason I know that I'm having them is because my brother is a nurse and told me what they feel like. Both of us have had treadmill stress tests and I have had a Thallium stress test; which all came back normal. How do you cope with PVCs? Is there any deep breathing technique that can help with them? Is just de-stressing enough to make them go away? I usually have 1 every other day; but yesterday; I had 4; and I got a little worried. Thank you!,2001,2001,,,thank doctor answer previous post chest pain famili dr diagnos costochondr i final start feel better howev past week i begun pvcs can stress caus pvcs happen my father die unexpect dec 22 brother i episod pvcs i 31 29 i also babi 5 week father die i addit stress we never pvcs the reason i know im brother nurs told feel like both us treadmil stress test i thallium stress test came back normal how cope pvcs is deep breath techniqu help is destress enough make go away i usual 1 everi day yesterday i 4 i got littl worri thank
1000,Atenolol+hypertension,Doctor; A few months ago while checking my pulse; I first noticed my heart skipping beats. This now happens regularly throughout the day. I never had this problem before. Are these also referred to as PVC's? What caused this to happen? Will these skipped beats go away? I started taking Zestril for high blood pressure right before these skipped beats started to occur. Did the Zestril do this to me? Could a blockage cause these skipped beats?

1001,Atenolol+hypertension,I have horrible pvc's; bigeminy; trigeminy; supra ventricular contractions; and they happen to me everyday nonstop. I was referred to by my cardiologist to an electrophysiologist; and he refused to do the electro test on me. He said it was just stress. But; I still feel that it is stemming from the electrical system in my heart because I get it mainly after I eat; or if I move a certain way such as bending over. He suggested a beta blocker; and the first time I talked with him; he said if I could handle the pvc's then it would be best not to take it. But the 2nd visit; he said that I NEED to take it; because in the long run my heart will weaken because of them. Is this true? Because I bought my prescription of Coreg; and am terrified to take it; and I CAN deal with the pvc's as long as I know it's NOT gonna weaken my heart later. I am only 24.,2007,2007,,,i horribl pvcs bigemini trigemini supra ventricular contract happen everyday nonstop i refer cardiologist electrophysiologist refus electro test he said stress but i still feel stem electr system heart i get main i eat i move certain way bend he suggest beta blocker first time i talk said i could handl pvcs would best take but 2nd visit said i need take long run heart weaken is true becaus i bought prescript coreg terrifi take i can deal pvcs long i know not gon na weaken heart later i 24
1002,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 35 yr old male in reasonably good health (Chol is little high at 230). I have had palpitations on and off for about 4 yrs; however; recently they have been worse. Most of my problems occur at night. Ususally right when I am falling to sleep; I sometimes wake up with a ""startled"" feeling; almost like my heart is beating too hard for me to go to sleep. Its a very uncomfortable feeling; but eventually I can fall asleep. However; recently; I was getting palpitations so bad (very strong beats); that I was awake all night. I went to my Drs and he put me on 25mg of Antelol. It didn't do much. He also had an EKG;ECHO;blood test; and Holter monitor which all came back normal. I am going to get an event monitor soon as well as see my Cardiologist who is booked up until Jan 29th.

1004,Atenolol+hypertension,"Thank you so much for taking time to answer my quesitons.I am a female 31 years old no family history of heart disease non smoker 5'2"" and now am 148 pounds (after losing 50 pounds.. I have been on WW). Well I have gone in SEVERAL times within the last year for heart palpitations and each time the Dr. says I am fine it is normal dont worry about it. But no ekg or anything they suggested see a mental health person to discuss stress. they did do a blood test and all is fine. they also took BP and it is 118/68. My pulse although elevated shortly after the episodes will drop right back down to my normal range 70-80 BPM. Well here is my dillemma. I went to a DR. outside of the Kaiser organization and he did an ekg that was normal and put me on a 24 hour monitor. Durning the 24 hour monitor I had a couple of episodes. during one episode the paramedics were called. Well the paramedics did an ekg and said they saw some premature beats. (the episode was over by then and i was in my ""recovery"" mode) This was something that the dr. did not see the day before when they did the ekg in the office. my ?? are as follows: can the 24 hr. holter indicate wether the ""palpitations"" are life threatening what is a premature beat and is this a point of major concen? One paramedic said that as i took slow deep breaths in my heart rate would go up then as i slowly exhaled it would go down. is this normal? Are there any other test that I should request to insure all bases are covered? Thank you again for all of your help.

1005,Atenolol+hypertension,Thanks for taking my question: I went in to the ER last week due to PVC's that have been with me for about 40 days now- I get a few hundred per day. I typically get them once every 3-4 months lasting a few days and then dissappear for another 3-6 months. All echo's; holters; stress tests- normal. I am 40; male; non smoker; non drinker; perfect weight. Why all of a sudden do we see a change in them ie: lasting longer than typical? I have been under stress lately ie: move; career etc ... My cardiologist says that they could go on for months or dissappear tommorow for months again. Question: 2- I am not a diabetic but I do notice that when my blood sugar is low I start getting PVC's almost instantly. Is this some coerrelation between PVC's and low blood sugar? Note: mom is type 2 diabetic Finally; I noticed on the blood results my cholesteral readings have come down: Total Chol- 214 down to 155 LDL - 118 down to 80 HDL - 43 same no change Trig - 26 up to 99 Blood sugar- 90 this after having eaten 3 hrs before blood was taken when at emerg. Why the sudden increase in trig? It almost seems that i reduced my LDL by more than 35% but the trig went up by almost the same percentage? STrange.

1007,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello; I am a 23 year old woman who has been having PVC's since I was 16 years old. I was only lucky enough to have them recorded and diagnosed as of last August 2005. I have had a echo; holter monitor; 2 stress tests; blood work and ekg; all results normal except for PVC's. I have elevated cholesterol since it is heridatary on my fathers side but it is just above borderline right now; I am thin and eat very healthy. I have had 4 spurts of unrecorded events that felt like PVC's and tachycardia together (hr at 180+ during the events). This has me concerned. Also I have lately found a coorelation of PVC's with exercise; though I can get them at any time during the day; it just seems to happen with exercise lately. I also tend to have chest pain that can be a sharp pain right in the apex area of the left side of my chest or hard in the centre and feels like it spreads to the right and left sides of my chest. I also get intense upper back pain. My questions are: 1.)should it be a concern to me about the pvc's on exercise so much lately? could a pvc at that rate stop my heart or somthing worse? 2.)What do you think of my chest pain? It can be pretty intense and last 5-10 mins other times it's only for a second. 3.)during the very fast hr spurts (not diagnosed) where it feels like my heart is just going crazy and it feels like pvc's at the same time; is this symptoms typical of those who end up with v-fib?What is happening if it is just ""normal""? 4.)I have seen a cardiologist and I am wondering is it nessacary or important that I see an electrophysiologist?

1008,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Again; I am still being plagued by these new sensations and feeling quite fed up with it all!I am getting an unusual palp sensation that feels like it grips me completely;it isn't a usual palp I can ignor;it comes on STRONG and forces me to listen.I had a bad palp yesterday that afterwards felt like someone was choking me and I had alot of pressure in my face.My face was hot and very flushed as too my arms and chest.It then passed.I am fearing I am having a very bad new arrhymia of some kind.I have tested normal on ecg;ekg;holter;bloodwork and stress test. Can I still be having a heart palp that is potientially fatal even after these good tests?Should I fear these new sensations?What should I do next?I went to the ER and had a 10 sec ekg that was good; but I also didn't feel anything unusual when it was on me.What do you infer about my situation?I am at the end of my rope and need some sort of explanation as to why I shouldn't fear dying from this.I am 23;female;normal weight & currently in councilling for my nervousness over this new sensation.I fear multiple pvcs and v-tach;since v-fib is a great rish at that point. HELP! Help me to understand my risks; what this may be(possibly;the chances that it is what I fear and why I should not fear dying from this. Thanks again for your time and I hope you can really give me some insight as to what to do next and what exactly is going on with my heart.I know you suggested anitarrhymics if pvcs effect my QOL. But if I can get past the stress; do I really need a drug like that?Wouldn't a beta-blocker be safer for me?

And i think there would be a few of us out there who had there self (dare i say it) dead and buried !! Too many trips to doctors; trips in ambulances; ER departments the lists goes on but always leaving with what seems like no answers. However thankfully for me a chance meeting one night in the ER department with a wonderful doctor who arranged for me to see a great cardiologist that day of which neither fogged me off but instead gave me answers; which after all seems to be the best medicine of all. So in a nut shell i get palps; skips; flutters and my all time favorite svt; I don't know which one they are; pvc or pac or why i sometimes get svt i just know this i need to learn to live with them and not let them BE my life but accept that they are apart of my life; for how long who knows ??

1010,Atenolol+hypertension,Age 36/male. Had panic attacks/skipped beats @ 21; recently returned 6 months ago. Tests: nuclear stress test; echo; several ekg's; xray of chest and two 24hour halter monitors all in past 6 month's; all showed normal. The recent 24hour monitor captured my symptoms. Was told that they were 40 PAC's and 7 single point PVC's. PVC's are the one's I believe that happened during sexual arousal. Two cardiologists said it's harmless. The 24hour monitor recorded 4 PVC's this time during sexual activity. I had a couple of occasions of intense arousal where I had what I believe to be a run of these for a minute or two. I believe the symptoms were the same; just longer and it feels like: Skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; skip-regbeat; etc. for the whole minute or two. It feels as if it's locked in and will never return; then it does... Could this continue endlessly? I don't feel short of breath or anything. When the run happens; it feels like my heart rate slows; becomes steady and consistent also. Sometimes it will speed up a little afterward,2007,2007,,,age 36male had panic attacksskip beat 21 recent return 6 month ago test nuclear stress test echo sever ekg xray chest two 24hour halter monitor past 6 month show normal the recent 24hour monitor captur symptom was told 40 pac 7 singl point pvcs pvcs one i believ happen sexual arous two cardiologist said harmless the 24hour monitor record 4 pvcs time sexual activ i coupl occas intens arous i i believ run minut two i believ symptom longer feel like skipregbeat skipregbeat skipregbeat etc whole minut two it feel lock never return could continu endless i dont feel short breath anyth when run happen feel like heart rate slow becom steadi consist also sometim speed littl afterward

He says he has grapefruit everyday. Well; I had already started eating and drinking it. Thought I would be the guinea pig! Maybe I should change my name to the Grape Fruit! Going to be shot 17 tomorrow and feel good today! UND at 12 week and doc says I have a 60-65% chance of clearing. Thanks to all of you for helping to keep me positive.

To me if it did exist there would be signs of it such as relapse during Chemotherapy or when otherwise immune suppressed. This doesn’t seem to occur that often if at all. So Occult HepC was never an issue for me. Might have to re-think that attitude after HCV was found in the kidney yet the patient was PCR neg and no hcv found in a biopsy sample. Classicly cured apart from the detecable HCV in his kidney. A somewhat intriguing article really. I never knew HCV had been detected in the kidneys of HCV+ people. As for being detected in someone who was HCV-; well not sure what to make of that. Other than I might owe DoubleDose an apology. Anyway here is the article Liver International 28 (6) ; 889–891 doi:10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01672.x Renal hepatitis C in the absence of detectable serum or hepatic virus Abstract We report an apparently unique case where hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was identified in renal tissue from a patient with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and treated chronic hepatitis C; despite the absence of detectable virus in the serum or liver (COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). The implications of this finding are discussed; with particular reference to current concepts regarding ‘occult’ hepatitis C infection. Case A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with lower-limb swelling and was found to have stigmata of chronic liver disease and abnormal liver biochemistry. Hepatitis C serology was positive; as was an ‘in-house’ serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (lower limit of detection; 50 IU/ml). Liver biopsy revealed features of established cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C infection. His only known possible risk factor for HCV was a course of dental treatment in southeast Asia 30 years earlier. He was initially treated with two 12-month courses of interferon-α monotherapy with normalisation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and negativity for HCV RNA by the same ‘in-house’ assay. However; he became PCR positive 3 months after cessation of interferon therapy. Three years later he was given a 12-month course of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin with similar results (PCR negativity during treatment with relapse 3 months afterwards) and also started on treatment with atenolol for mild essential hypertension. Given the increasing evidence in support of maintenance interferon therapy; 2 years later he was given a further course of pegylated interferon–ribavirin combination therapy; with withdrawal of ribavirin after 6 months. Pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued over the next 3 years; during which he remained in good health (other than the occasional episode of gout treated with colchicine and allopurinol) and had a normal ALT and undetectable HCV RNA on repeated testing with the previously described assay. Baseline creatinine was normal and there were no documented episodes of renal impairment. He did; however; on one occasion; develop a rash on his lower legs; which was typical of that seen in cryoglobulinaemia. At this time he was found to be positive for serum HCV RNA and on further questioning explained that in the preceding month he had been injecting interferon that he had inadvertently left inside a hot automobile rather than stored in a refrigerator. Two weeks later he presented acutely with a 10-day history of general deterioration; abdominal and leg swelling and then development of a florid blistering erythematous rash over his lower limbs. Pertinent investigative findings included low serum albumin; raised serum creatinine; low C3 and C4 levels; positive urinary dipstick testing for blood; raised urinary protein at 1.5 g/24 h and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M κ band on cryoprecipitate and Ig electrophoresis. Hepatitis C IgG was positive while serum HCV RNA was undetectable on this and subsequent occasions using a COBAS Amplicor qualitative assay (Roche Diagnostics Limited; Burgess Hill; UK; lower limit of detection 50 IU/ml). A computed tomography scan of the chest; abdomen and pelvis showed features of cirrhosis with splenomegaly and ascites; but no lymphadenopathy. His remaining liver biochemistry and prothrombin time were normal. A liver biopsy (obtained via the transjugular route) was also negative for HCV RNA by the same PCR assay and histologically showed advanced cirrhosis with minimal interface hepatitis. Skin biopsy was consistent with bacterial cellulitis and this responded to ongoing treatment with intravenous antibiotics; leaving a residual (minimal) rash of purpuric appearance. Renal biopsy confirmed a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). PCR assay of renal tissue was positive for HCV RNA; in contrast to simultaneous serum and cryoprecipitate samples that were negative. The HCV genotype was not determined. In view of the diagnosis of HCV-associated cryoglobulinaemic MPGN; treatment with pegylated interferon-α2a 90 mcg weekly was continued and his condition slowly improved with normalisation of serum creatinine and albumin. Unfortunately; he was subsequently readmitted to the hospital with an episode of severe septicaemia and multiple organ failure secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; and died despite aggressive therapy including ventilatory and inotropic support.

1013,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi all; Sorry for the long 'history' - this is my first post on this board! : ) Been battling PVCs that I know of since 2007; suspected I've had them prior; but just didn't know what they were. Oh to be that ignorant again!! : ) Dx in 2007 from Cardio & EP was ""benign; frequent PVCs"" and that treatment would be worse than just living with them. So I went on my way; had some off & on; but this winter had a bunch & ended up in ER twice. New cardio did Holter; Stress Echo; Bubble test; 72 hr event monitor. Results were PVCs; PACs and a 4 beat run of NSVT. I have a floppy intraatrial septum; but no PFO & no aneurysm. Her recommendation was to take a low-dose BB (Bystolic); but since everything was structurally normal; to just do follow-ups every few years. Well; the whole thing got me on the anxiety ""must find answers"" treadmill; so had consult w/ original cardio & new EP in that old practice. Basically told me the same thing; no red flags; but EP said we ""should"" treat the PVCs bec. I have ""so many"". I do get a lot and I DO feel them. I mostly get them at rest; when my pulse is LOW; so 2 very short trials on BBs (atenolol & Bystolic) seemed to increase the PVCs which is NOT what I wanted. So EP was all ""you should take Flecanide"" and I said ""go jump off a bridge""! If the PVCs are ""benign"" then WHY do I need treatment? I was having dizzy spells; so we did a TTT; which was ""positive"" for POTS; but EP didn't want to dx me with that until I ruled out other causes; like medication/blood sugar things. ???? I have other symptoms of dysautonomia; so I'm still not sure that's not a component of the whole PVC thing. SO - today had 3rd EP consultation - where he said looking at my EKG; the PVCs seem to originate in the RVOT; which can be amenable to ablation; but sometimes only a 50/50 chance of complete success. He also mentioned Flecanide or Rhythmol - bec. I have a ""healthy heart"" the dangers aren't there that people think. I asked what is the danger of NOT treating it and he said ""there is none; you're basically treating a symptom and when the symptom becomes too much to handle; we'll treat it"". Seriously? I'm not sure who else knows where there PVCs come from - and can you really tell just from an EKG? and is this really NOT life-threatening? He kept saying they were not - they wouldn't cause me to drop dead; which is the reason I'd seek treatment. Yes; they drive me crazy some days; but if it's really & truly NOT dangerous; why would I want to mess around w/ a strong anti-arrhytmic med and/or an ablation? I am exhausted by all of this - worrying about the PVCs; worrying they are missing something; worrying they are ""different today"" & I need to go back to the Drs.; wondering if there is some other underlying cause that can be 'fixed'?? My husband thinks I need a moratorium on even thinking about these things & just go back for annual cardio visits; but I'm so freaked about missing a ""new symptom"" that may change my diagnosis; I can't stop researching. I am seeing a counselor for the anxiety; just in case you were wondering! : ) These things really do make me crazy; but I'm not crazy enough to do the meds or ablation. Yet.

1015,Atenolol+hypertension,"I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and paroxymal hypertension in my twenties. I've always felt skipped beats to some degree. About three years ago I had onset of paroxymal atrial fibrillation; this was diagnosed in the emergency room. My heart rate was 153 bpm and irregular. I've had about twelve bouts of this atrial fibrillation since this time. It does seem to be triggered by stress; but no one can figure out the cause. Echos show a mild mitral valve prolapse; that's all. I started having many skipped beats around October last year. I went to the doctor; who put a holter monitor on. It showed approximately 680 skipped beats in the 24 hour period. She diagnosed this as PSVT. I then followed up with my cardiologist who did a thallium stress test; which revealed all was normal. He then put a holter monitor on last week. The computer print out said I had 1;127 narrow beats within the 24 hour period. I believe that; as my diary showed almost constant skipped beats. My cardiologist told me I was imagining them; that I had only truly had 14 skipped beats; and that the computer errored.He feels it's my esophagus causing this. If it was my esophagus; why would I feel skips in my pulse? Does any of this sound dangerous to you? I am currently on tenormin 25mg t.i.d. It doesn't seem to help this PSVT from occuring. The only two things I know is they are worse at period time; and they are worse depending on how I move (bending over can cause them to start) and once they start sometimes they just won't quit for awhile. Is there a cure for all of this? I am also wondering if these ""narrow beats"" which he also referred to as PAC's are to do with the atrium and maybe my heart is trying to convert into a-fib full time rather than paroxymal? Any info you can give me is much appreciated.

1016,Atenolol+hypertension,"I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken. Every time I go to the Dr's office; they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!) Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me! I know the pulse is high; but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now; and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home. But the blood pressure...ugh! I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over. And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying ""well; your numbers are a little too high for your age; even though you are nervous"" (I just turned 30). So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken? How did you do it? I really want to get over this.

1017,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a healthy 37 year old woman; who went through surgical menopause two years ago. [Other than many repeated viral illnesses in the past six months] I am at an ideal body weight; I exercise 3-4 times weekly; and I don't smoke. I take Premarin and progesterone daily. This past winter; after suffering a fairly severe flu; I began to experience what has been diagnosed as inappropriate sinus tachycardia for the first time. For the 37 years prior; I never had any cardio issues whatsoever. Then I suddenly began to experience unexplained bouts of rapid heart beat and shortness of breath. At first my symptoms abated when I increased my estrogen replacement; only to return again in a more severe form about two months later. I began to have bouts of rapid heart beat and ""skipped beats"" daily from about 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. -- bothersome enough to prevent me from being able to do anything; with a BP of about 150/95 during these episodes. Advice to just ignore it really wasn't helpful -- I was too short of breath during the episodes to be able to really function. Chance in diet; relaxing; completely avoiding caffeine; alcohol; etc. made no real difference. I have run the gamut of tests; holter monitor; echocardiogram; stress tests; VQ scan; blood work; pheo testing -- all has come back normal. Event monitors captured my rapid beats and premature beats. Now I am taking 25mg of Toprol each day; which seems to really help; although I still feel the side effects a bit -- sleepiness; etc. Two questions: 1. Does anyone have any idea as to what causes this condition to begin in the first place? I'm very frustrated by suggestions that it ""must be stress"" in the absence of an obvious physical cause. I know myself well; and stress is not the answer; nor is caffiene; alcohol; etc. Could a virus have triggered this? If so; is this type of condition generally life long; or time limited? I somehow feel either hormones or a virus must be the underlying culprit. My doctors seem more interested in just treating the symptoms and not getting to the cause; and I haven't been able to find any info on origins of inappropriate sinus tachydardia. 2. My cardiologist advised me to continue to exercise as much as possible. When beta blockers slow the heart rate; does that bar the aerobic benefits of exercise? Thank you so much!

I am managing panic/pvc's without medication but it is so hard when your heart is racing close to 160 bpm...(I did use xanax for 6 months but do not liek the way it makes me feel fater use but did help the panic) usually it is brought on by hypervigilance or misinterpretting normal body sensations..

1019,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 35 year old; 145 lb. woman with two small children. No known health issues; generally pretty healthy. B/P usually 120/70. Ever since I had my first daughter; I have had episodes of what they tell me are pvc's and pac's. I will be standing making dinner; or sitting with my children and it will feel like this heavy sinking feeling in my chest (almost throat) area. For the most part; it is quick; and if I brace for literally a few seconds; it's over. Since this past August; I have had 5 different episodes where it feels as though it is fluttering and my rythym does not reset immediately; the longest one lasting close to 6 minutes. It is a very strange feeling which starts like the sinking feeling I get from the premature beats but doesn't stop. It is difficult to catch my breath during the episode and it is very frightening. I am not an anxious person; and am generally able to stand and ride it out; but there are times where it feels like it will not reset and it can make me a little nervous. Only once; it made me very dizzy and short of breath; but that lasted less than 30 seconds. I wore an event monitor for 30 days; where they were able to record the PVC; PAC activity. I was also told that I was having a supraventricular tachycardia. I am told by my cardiologist that she is ""very confident"" that it is nothing to worry about.

1020,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi Everyone! I’m female; about 120 lbs; 5.4” tall. I’ve had Syncope and pre-syncope since my early 20’s and I’m 35 yrs old now. I’ve had 4-5 of these/year but this year I’ve already had 4 pre-syncopes and one full blown Syncope. During these episodes I have: Extreme nausea; palpitations; ringing/ buzz like sound in my ears and then no sound at all; feel hot and sweaty and then cold after it passes;etc..I usually know I’m going to faint because of these symptoms but I have also fainted sometimes with no previous warning or presyncope. I’ve also had 2 episodes of very severe palpitations which lasted for 15-20 min just after I had started mild exercise ( Felt as if my heart was in my throat). I have never taken this very seriously until recently because I’ve been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia for pain in my back and arms and I started swimming as recommended by my Rheumatologist but now I’m scared to get into the pool. On a daily basis; I feel extremely fatigued; dizzy; dis-oriented; sometimes short of breath after even slight activity. I have been recording my vitals recently. I have low normal BP of 90-100/60-70; Heart rate while sitting is in 80s and on standing is from upper 90s to sometimes in 120s. My Cardiologist said that I might have Neuro=cardiogenic Syncope but I had a negative tilt-table test result and normal Echo and Stress tests. So; now he is suggesting an implantable loop recorder since my syncope is so infrequent but I got scared and asked for a 30 day event monitor instead. He has also referred me to a EP Cardiologist. Now; I’m having second thoughts and thinking of getting the Implantable loop recorder instead of a 30 day event monitor as I’m really desperate to find out what is wrong with me and just want to have a normal life and not worry constantly about fainting as I live alone. I’m really confused and would highly appreciate any input/suggestions on where to go from here.,2012,2012,,Female,hi everyon im femal 120 lbs 54 tall ive syncop presyncop sinc earli 20s im 35 yrs old ive 45 theseyear year ive alreadi 4 presyncop one full blown syncop dure episod i extrem nausea palpit ring buzz like sound ear sound feel hot sweati cold passesetci usual know im go faint symptom i also faint sometim previous warn presyncop ive also 2 episod sever palpit last 1520 min i start mild exercis felt heart throat i never taken serious recent ive diagnos fibromyalgia pain back arm i start swim recommend rheumatologist im scare get pool on daili basi i feel extrem fatigu dizzi disori sometim short breath even slight activ i record vital recent i low normal bp 901006070 heart rate sit 80s stand upper 90s sometim 120s my cardiologist said i might neurocardiogen syncop i negat tilttabl test result normal echo stress test so suggest implant loop record sinc syncop infrequ i got scare ask 30 day event monitor instead he also refer ep cardiologist now im second thought think get implant loop record instead 30 day event monitor im realli desper find wrong want normal life worri constant faint i live alon im realli confus would high appreci inputsuggest go
1021,Atenolol+hypertension,Hi; I am 26. At the end of February I have started to feel some singular; strong heart beats every day. The feeling was that as if I had forgotten to breathe for a second; then had take one deep breath and then those heart beats were comming with a feeling of anxiety and scare. I have decided to go to a specialist with those symptoms. I got reffered to blood test (morphology); holter ecg 24 monitor; 24 h blood pressure monitor and hearts echocardiography. The blood test was ok - I have got a bit too high level of sodium (146 mmol/l with max of 145 mmol/l). The 24 hour blood pressure monitor showed small hypertension (my average day result was 141/81 when standard should be 135/85; and my averagenight result 129/69 when a norm is 120/70). My echocardiography was ok; it didn't show anything; which could have influence on the hearts rythm; the anatomy was correct. And there it comes to 24 hour holter ecg monitor... It has caught nsVT episode with 11 beats with fastest V-Tach 161 bpm - at 8:25. The whole VENTRICULAR ECTOPY statystics are shown below: All VE: 118 VE Pairs: 0 V-Tach: 1 Longest V-Tach: 11 beats at 20:25 Fastest V-Tach: 161 bpm at 20:25 Slowest V-tach: N/A VE`s per 1000/per hour: 2/6 VE total : 118 V-Pair total : 0 V-Run total (V-Tach) : 1 Longest V-Run (V-Tach) : 11 beats at 20:25 Max HR V-Run (V-Tach): 161 bpm at 20:25 Min HR V-Run (V-Tach): N/A VE's per 1000/per hour : 2/6 Ventricular R on T : N/A And the rest: HEART RATE Min HR : 46 bpm at 8:06 Max HR : 135 bpm at 8:59 Avg HR 24 hours : 87 bpm Min HR hourly : 70 bpm at 4:00 Max HR hourly : 105 bpm at 9:00 Analyzed beat : 116365 SUPRAVENTRICULAR ECTOPY SVE total : 0 SV-Run Total : 0 Longest SV-Run : N/A Max HR SV-Run : N/A SVE's per 1000/ hour : 0/1 Total aberrant beats : 0 Atrial Fib/flutter : 0.0% ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS Total ST Minutes Ch.1 : 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.2: 0 Total ST Minutes Ch.3 : 0 Max delta ST depression : N/A Max delta elevation : N/A Max ST episode : N/A Max HR in ST episode : 0 First; I need to confess; that I am really scared after speaking with my cardiologist; when she had seen the results of my 24 h holter monitor examination - the point of her(and; from now on; mine especially) concern is V-Tach noticed on 20:25. She told me; that it is a very dangerous type of arrhythmia which can cause fainting or even death. I need to tell you that I am true valetudinarian - I tend to analyze the worst possible scenarios when I feel any ailment and to be worried about it. So when I have seen the concern of my cardiologist I don't need to describe you; what influence on me it has... I have been prescribed betaloc 50 mg once a day; and 2 magnesium 500 mg pills twice a day. One important thing: on January and March I have got some serious issues on personal nature which was a really stressful time for me (in fact it is still); this combined with difficult situation in my job made me feel really bad at that time - I have got holter examination then so I suppose that it could have an influence on its results. Now with one more problem - being so worried about my health; I am totally down:/ What concerns me the most... is this episode of V-Tach really so serious? Am I in danger of loosing consciousness in every moment; or even have sudden cardiac death? Is it really something bad with my body; heart; psychology; my mind; so in case of stressful situations I have described; it ends with nsVT like the one caught during holter examination? I am not sure if my cardiologist did well by prescribing me strong heart medicine stright away; and frigtening me with possible serious consequences of my illness (I have been told that I am ill). When I was coming back home after this visit; suddenly I felt very fast hart beating with a feeling like my hart would jumped in into my stomach; I was in panic; for the seconds I was sure it is the end... After couple of minutes everything was back in normal. Now I know it was a panic disorder - first one in my life. I don't think it was accidence that it happen after seeing with my doctor ... I wouldbe grateful for help with analyzing my results and telling me a bit more about nsVT episodes regarding to young people; without earlier heart issues. PS. Sorry for some spelling mistakes - english is not my native language; but I tried to do my best so you can understand all from what I wanted to say.,2013,2013,,Male,hi i 26 at end februari i start feel singular strong heart beat everi day the feel i forgotten breath second take one deep breath heart beat com feel anxieti scare i decid go specialist symptom i got reffer blood test morpholog holter ecg 24 monitor 24 h blood pressur monitor heart echocardiographi the blood test ok i got bit high level sodium 146 mmoll max 145 mmoll the 24 hour blood pressur monitor show small hypertens averag day result 14181 standard 13585 averagenight result 12969 norm 12070 my echocardiographi ok didnt show anyth could influenc heart rythm anatomi correct and come 24 hour holter ecg monitor it caught nsvt episod 11 beat fastest vtach 161 bpm 825 the whole ventricular ectopi statyst shown all ve 118 ve pair 0 vtach 1 longest vtach 11 beat 2025 fastest vtach 161 bpm 2025 slowest vtach na ves per 1000per hour 26 ve total 118 vpair total 0 vrun total vtach 1 longest vrun vtach 11 beat 2025 max hr vrun vtach 161 bpm 2025 min hr vrun vtach na ves per 1000per hour 26 ventricular r t na and rest heart rate min hr 46 bpm 806 max hr 135 bpm 859 avg hr 24 hour 87 bpm min hr hour 70 bpm 400 max hr hour 105 bpm 900 analyz beat 116365 supraventricular ectopi sve total 0 svrun total 0 longest svrun na max hr svrun na sves per 1000 hour 01 total aberr beat 0 atrial fibflutt 00 st segment analysi total st minut ch1 0 total st minut ch2 0 total st minut ch3 0 max delta st depress na max delta elev na max st episod na max hr st episod 0 first i need confess i realli scare speak cardiologist seen result 24 h holter monitor examin point herand mine especi concern vtach notic 2025 she told danger type arrhythmia caus faint even death i need tell i true valetudinarian i tend analyz worst possibl scenario i feel ailment worri so i seen concern cardiologist i dont need describ influenc i prescrib betaloc 50 mg day 2 magnesium 500 mg pill twice day one import thing januari march i got serious issu person natur realli stress time fact still combin difficult situat job made feel realli bad time i got holter examin i suppos could influenc result now one problem worri health i total what concern episod vtach realli serious am i danger loos conscious everi moment even sudden cardiac death is realli someth bad bodi heart psycholog mind case stress situat i describ end nsvt like one caught holter examin i sure cardiologist well prescrib strong heart medicin stright away frigten possibl serious consequ ill i told i ill when i come back home visit sudden i felt fast hart beat feel like hart would jump stomach i panic second i sure end after coupl minut everyth back normal now i know panic disord first one life i dont think accid happen see doctor i wouldb grate help analyz result tell bit nsvt episod regard young peopl without earlier heart issu ps sorri spell mistak english nativ languag i tri best understand i want say
1022,Atenolol+hypertension,Patient is 48 year old Cambodian female w/ family hx hypertension and autoimmune disorders (multiple drug/food allergies; IgM nephropathy; asthma). Prior hx: 1) post-traumatic seizure disorder; well controlled on gabapentin1200 mg daily 2) hypothyroidism; euthyroid on 100mcg synthroid daily. Onset was after commencing gabapentin; ? secondary to the drug? 3) hypertension; generally well controlled on irbesartan 300mg daily but exacerbates emotionally stressed Management of the above has been greatly complicated by allergic reactions to: dilantin; phenobarbital; valproic acid; ACE inhibitors; atenolol; thiazide diuretics. Excepting valproic acid; all these reactions occurred 2-4 weeks after exposure with rash; urticaria; photophobia; malaise. s. Reaction to valproic acid occurred almost 2 years after initiating therapy and was of Stevens-Johnson type. 1 year ago for gradual onset on neck and shoulder pain radiating down the arms; and numbness in the hand. MRI showed nerve root compression at C5-7. EMG showed median nerve compression. She was treated with physiotherapy and with NSAIDs but latter had to be stopped after allergic reaction. Carpal tunnel release in June 2004 resolved numbness of hand but stiffness and pain at wrist and fingers con tinued & progressed to generalized polyarthralgias; impairing ADLs. 6 months ago; a rheumatologist dx'd RA based on clinical exam & elevated ESR. Placed on ASA and hydrochloroquine with initial e improvement in joint pain but allergic reaction required discontinuation . Switched to methotrexate. Joint pain did not improve and about 3-4 weeks into treatment she had another allergic reaction; this one of Stevens-Johnson type and very severe. Next placed on SSZ;t pain improved allergic reaction (rash/urticaria) required discontinuation. A second rheumatologist/immunologist conducted more comprehensive exam including hand/wrist xrays; ANA; rheumatoid factor; C-reactive protein etc. All tests negative except for ESR which was elevated. Hand/wrist films showed only mild osteoarthritic changes disproportional to the amount of pain and functional impairment. He dx'd serum sickness rather than RA and rx'd prednisolone 30mg/day tapering down to 10mg. Now 3 months later; prednisolone is 10 mg daily and joint pain continues to severely limit ADLs. Severity flunctuates but pain never completely absent. She has had 2 mild allergic reactions to drugs during this period. Every effort is made to avoid new drug exposures but unfortunately her other medical problems sometimes result in hospital or doctor visits where; despite being provided with the history; new drugs and/or drugs she is known to be allergic to (e.g. NSAIDs) are given. Q: How likely that arthralgia due to past drug reactions? If so; what is long term prognosis? Suggestions on management? Could it instead be a adverse effect gabapentin or irbesartan? If so; what to do given allergy to most alternatives,2005,2005,,,patient 48 year old cambodian femal w famili hx hypertens autoimmun disord multipl drugfood allergi igm nephropathi asthma prior hx 1 posttraumat seizur disord well control gabapentin1200 mg daili 2 hypothyroid euthyroid 100mcg synthroid daili onset commenc gabapentin secondari drug 3 hypertens general well control irbesartan 300mg daili exacerb emot stress manag great complic allerg reaction dilantin phenobarbit valproic acid ace inhibitor atenolol thiazid diuret except valproic acid reaction occur 24 week exposur rash urticaria photophobia malais reaction valproic acid occur almost 2 year initi therapi stevensjohnson type 1 year ago gradual onset neck shoulder pain radiat arm numb hand mri show nerv root compress c57 emg show median nerv compress she treat physiotherapi nsaid latter stop allerg reaction carpal tunnel releas june 2004 resolv numb hand stiff pain wrist finger con tinu progress general polyarthralgia impair adl 6 month ago rheumatologist dxd ra base clinic exam elev esr place asa hydrochloroquin initi e improv joint pain allerg reaction requir discontinu switch methotrex joint pain improv 34 week treatment anoth allerg reaction one stevensjohnson type sever next place sszt pain improv allerg reaction rashurticaria requir discontinu a second rheumatologistimmunologist conduct comprehens exam includ handwrist xray ana rheumatoid factor creactiv protein etc all test negat except esr elev handwrist film show mild osteoarthrit chang disproport amount pain function impair he dxd serum sick rather ra rxd prednisolon 30mgday taper 10mg now 3 month later prednisolon 10 mg daili joint pain continu sever limit adl sever flunctuat pain never complet absent she 2 mild allerg reaction drug period everi effort made avoid new drug exposur unfortun medic problem sometim result hospit doctor visit despit provid histori new drug andor drug known allerg eg nsaid given q how like arthralgia due past drug reaction if long term prognosi suggest manag could instead advers effect gabapentin irbesartan if given allergi altern
1023,Atenolol+hypertension,Just wondering if anyone has a 'miracle cure'!! For a few years now; I've been getting a red blotchy chest/neck rash in circumstances where I - am drinking alcohol; anxious; nervous; excited; upset - really feeling just about any emotion. It's gotten to the point where I do not expose my chest/neck ever - and cover up whenever I can. I had read once that taking Niacinimide could help - and I've been taking about 1000mg of it for a few months; but am not seeing much improvement. Anyone with any help or suggestions I would REALLY appreciate it.,2008,2008,,,just wonder anyon miracl cure for year ive get red blotchi chestneck rash circumst i drink alcohol anxious nervous excit upset realli feel emot it gotten point i expos chestneck ever cover whenev i i read take niacinimid could help ive take 1000mg month see much improv anyon help suggest i would realli appreci
1024,Atenolol+hypertension,I started again to have these feelings of skipped heart beats beginning on 7/23. Sometimes maybe 2 per minute but may go as high as 10 per minute. The come and go during the day which is very frustrating. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Paxil CR for anxiety for about two years now. I haven't had any issues with these skipped beats since 3/03. Then all of a sudden they return. In March I went to see a cardiologist I met during my anxiety issues and he assured me that my heart was in great shape and these skipped beats can re-surface and disappear just like that. In 2000 I developed anxiety symptoms and was treated for them. I had numerous tests at a cardiologist's offce during this time since some of my anxiety symptoms were causing what I thought were heart issues. I had a stress echo in 9/99 and a cardiolite stress test in 6/01. All negative. Twenty-one day event monitor; X-rays and numerous blood tests along with re-visits to a cardiologist since 2000. I am an avid cyclist and tennis player three times a week. I drink coffee in the morning but it is a light caffeine version. Alcohol on the weekends and sometimes during the week with neighbors. I am not overweight and watch what I eat. Giving you all this backgound; why do these skipped hearts beats keep coming and going. They create a very uncomfortable; anxious feeling when they happen and I am quite sure they feed my anxiety. Can I do anything about them. Are they serious? Do you have any advice or should I expect to live with them.,2003,2003,,,i start feel skip heart beat begin 723 sometim mayb 2 per minut may go high 10 per minut the come go day frustrat i take 125 mg paxil cr anxieti two year i havent issu skip beat sinc 303 then sudden return in march i went see cardiologist i met anxieti issu assur heart great shape skip beat resurfac disappear like in 2000 i develop anxieti symptom treat i numer test cardiologist offc time sinc anxieti symptom caus i thought heart issu i stress echo 999 cardiolit stress test 601 all negat twentyon day event monitor xray numer blood test along revisit cardiologist sinc 2000 i avid cyclist tenni player three time week i drink coffe morn light caffein version alcohol weekend sometim week neighbor i overweight watch i eat give backgound skip heart beat keep come go they creat uncomfort anxious feel happen i quit sure feed anxieti can i anyth are serious do advic i expect live
1025,Atenolol+hypertension,.....The advance involves two new discoveries. One is that a protein called NS4B is instrumental in binding some of the genetic material; or RNA; and allowing the hepatitis C virus to replicate. The other is that the former anti-itching drug clemizole hydrochloride could hinder that protein; resulting in a tenfold decrease in virus replication with no apparent harm to infected liver-like cells. Because the drug has already been used by people; it is eligible for human testing.....

1026,Atenolol+hypertension,"Thank you for your response to my CURIOUS TACHYCARDIA of Nov.11; 1998. You mentioned in your response additional tests that should be taken. I apologize for not giving that data initially: I was trying to keep the inquiry short and I felt (mistakenly so) that the symptoms were explicit enough to warrant additional comments. Specifically; I have had a 24 hour Holter monitor which showed several bursts of tachycardia during the day. My blood chemistry (several tests) is normal including the potassium levels. Thyroid function is normal. Other tests for the hypertension show no renal artery stenosis and no pheochromocytoma on the kidneys. The echogram shows my carotids are clear. The carotid sinus massage and the Valsalva maneuver are discussed in Harrison's INTERNAL MEDICINE. Reading up on the various forms of tachycardia there seem to be two candidates: sinus tachycardia due to bouts of hypotension or volume depletion and paroxysmal supraventicular tachycardia. The sinus tachycardia seems a poor candidate since it is chracterized in some of the material I have read as having a slow and gradual response to the carotid sinus massage; whereas my own experience was an immediate cessation once the massage was applied. That would leave the PSVT which has a fast response to the massage but seems to have many origins. If this material clarifies the situation; I would deeply appreciate you opinions on the following: 1. Does it seem that this could be one of the tachycardias that can be fatal at times? 2. With this additional data; can you express an opinion as to the most likely form of tachycardia? 3. Since I am under heavy medication; could my condition be due to interaction between several of the drugs? My present doctor is a cardiologist and he seems puzzled by these symptoms. Thank you for your help. George. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear George; Thank you for your question. There are many causes of tachycardia (fast heart beat) and they can be divided roughly into sinus (originating from the sinus node or heart's natural pacemaker) and non-sinus tachycardias. Nonsinus tachycardias are either supraventricular (coming from the upper chambers of the heart) or ventricular (coming from the lower chambers of the heart). Supraventricular tachycardias include: paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; atrial flutter; atrial fibrillation and AV nodal tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardias are more serious in nature and are due to a rapid depolarization of the ventricles. Sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate of greater than 100 beats per minute originating from the sinus node. Sinus tachycardia is classified as either appropriate or inappropriate. There are many causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia such as exercise; anxiety; panic attacks; dehydration; deconditioning; volume loss due to bleeding or other loss of body fluids; hyperthyroidism; electrolyte abnormalities and many other conditions. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia can only be diagnosed when all causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia have been ruled out. It is not clear what causes inappropriate sinus tachycardia but possible etiologies are an increase in the rate at which the sinus node depolarizes and an increased sensitivity to adrenaline. Once the diagnosis has been made by ruling out all of the potential causes of appropriate sinus tachycardia there are several treatment options. If the symptoms are not overly concerning no treatment needs to be done. There is no increase in morbidity or mortality in persons with this condition and they can expect to have a normal life-span. For persons in whom the symptoms are unbearable medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used; usually with good results. In the rare person unable to tolerate medical treatment catheter ablation (burning) of the sinus node with insertion of a pacemaker or surgical removal of the sinus node have been used in the past. Newer techniques are being developed using catheter ablation to modify and not destroy the sinus node thus avoiding the need for a pacemaker. This procedure is still in it's infancy and should only be undertaken at a major medical center after consultation with an electrophysiologist. Below are some journal articles that address this topic in depth. Your local medical library should be able to help you find copies. Review Articles: Krahn AD. Yee R. Klein GJ. Morillo C. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: evaluation and therapy. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology. 6(12):1124-8; 1995 Dec. Abstract Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is an ill-defined clinical syndrome characterized by an increased resting heart rate accompanied by an exaggerated response to exercise or stress. It is not associated with underlying structural heart disease. The mechanism may involve a primary abnormality of the sinus node demonstrating enhanced automaticity or; alternatively; a primary autonomic disturbance with increase sympathetic activity and enhanced sinus node beta-adrenergic sensitivity. The diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is one of exclusion. It is most common in young females; with a disproportionate number employed in the health care field. Autonomic and electrophysiologic testing may be required in selected individuals to clarify the mechanism and rule out sinus node reentry or right atrial tachycardia. Therapy of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is empiric. Pharmacologic approaches include beta blockers or verapamil. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the superior portion of the sinus node shows promise as a useful alternative in patients with refractory symptoms. Sims JM. Miracle V. Sinus tachycardia. Nursing. 26(6):49; 1996 Jun. Articles Concerning Catheter Treatment Options. Lee RJ. Kalman JM. Fitzpatrick AP. Epstein LM. Fisher WG. Olgin JE. Lesh MD. Scheinman MM. Radiofrequency catheter modification of the sinus node for ""inappropriate"" sinus tachycardia. Circulation. 92(10):2919-28; 1995 Nov 15. BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias refractory to medical therapy. However; in symptomatic patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia resistant to drug therapy; catheter ablation of the His' bundle with permanent pacemaker insertion is currently applied. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency modification of the sinus node as alternative therapy for patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with disabling episodes of inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to drug therapy (4.2 +/- 0.3 drug trials) underwent either total sinus node ablation or sinus node modification. The region of the sinus node was identified as the region of earliest atrial activation in sinus rhythm during electrophysiological study. This region was further defined by use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in 9 patients; in whom it was found that an ablation catheter could be guided reliably and maintained on the crista terminalis. Radiofrequency energy was delivered during tachycardia between either a standard 4-mm or custom 10-mm thermistor-imbedded catheter tip and a skin patch. Total sinus node ablation was performed successfully in all 4 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a junctional escape rhythm. Sinus node modification was successfully achieved in all 12 patients in whom it was attempted and was characterized by a 25% reduction in the sinus heart rate. For the group as a whole; exercise stress testing after ablation revealed a gradual chronotropic response; with a significant reduction in maximal heart rate (132.8 +/- 6.5 versus 179.5 +/- 3.6 beats per minute [bpm]; P < .001) without evidence of an exaggerated heart rate response to a light workload (103.0 +/- 4.1 versus 139.5 +/- 3.5 bpm; P < .001). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring revealed a significant decrease in maximal heart rate and mean heart rate after ablation (167.2 +/- 2.6 versus 96.7 +/- 5.0 bpm; P < .001; and 125.6 +/- 5.0 versus 54.1 +/- 5.3 bpm; P < .001; respectively). There was a significant decrease in the number of applications of radiofrequency energy required in patients undergoing modification of the sinus node when guided by ICE compared with fluoroscopy alone (3.6 +/- 0.8 versus 10.4 +/- 2.1; P < .01) as well as a decrease in fluoroscopy time (33.0 +/- 9.5 versus 58.5 +/- 8.4 minutes). After a mean follow-up period of 20.5 +/- 0.3 months; there were no recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent a total sinus node ablation. However; 2 patients who had a total sinus node ablation subsequently required permanent pacing because of symptomatic pauses; and 1 patient developed an ectopic atrial tachycardia. After a mean follow-up of 7.1 +/- 1.7 months; there were two recurrences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia in patients who underwent sinus node modification. However; no significant bradycardia or pauses were observed. Complications encountered during the study included 1 patient who developed transient right diaphragmatic paralysis and another patient who developed transient superior vena cava syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus node modification is feasible in humans and should be considered as an alternative to complete atrioventricular junctional ablation for patients with disabling inappropriate sinus tachycardia refractory to medical management. Sinus node modification may be aided by ICE. Jayaprakash S. Sparks PB. Vohra J. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST): management by radiofrequency modification of sinus node. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Medicine. 27(4):391-7; 1997 Aug. BACKGROUND: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a rare form of supraventricular arrhythmia. It can cause disabling symptoms and may be refractory to medical treatment. In symptomatic drug refractory patients; sinus node excision or total ablation of the sinus node with permanent pacemaker implantation was the only therapeutic option. Recently; radiofrequency (RF) modification of the sinus node has been reported to be an effective treatment for this condition. AIM: To present our experience with sinus node modification using RF energy in the management of IST. METHODS: Between 1989 to 1996 three patients (two females and one male); aged 28-36 years were diagnosed with symptomatic IST. All had failed multiple drugs and hence underwent sinus node modification using RF. In the first two patients; the site of RF application was guided by anatomical landmarks using fluoroscopy to localise the presumed most superior portion of the crista terminalis and also the earliest site of atrial activation. In the third patient; a 20 pole electrode catheter was used to map the crista terminalis and guide the ablation. Success was defined by 20-30% reduction in the heart rate with normal atrial activation sequence after ablation. RESULTS: The three patients described here had IST by clinical; electrocardiographic and electrophysiological criteria and were refractory to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs. The number of RF applications were 11; 15; and three applied at the site of earliest atrial activation for the control of heart rates. Patient 3 had a early recurrence at one month and underwent repeat sinus node modification (five RF applications). All three patients who underwent RF modification of the sinus node had a successful outcome. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patients remain asymptomatic during follow up (20; 12 and three months) with satisfactory control of heart rate; although one patient requires atenolol which was previously ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: RF modification of the sinus node is feasible and effective for IST; and should be the treatment of choice in patients refractory to medical therapy.

1027,Atenolol+hypertension,"I've been diagnosed with PVCs. I rarely experience them during the day and never when exercising. I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

1029,Atenolol+hypertension,Last night I had a vibration thing happen in my chest off and on for about 2 hours. I am almost positive that my pulse was normal just fast (100-110). It was scary but I didn't panic and my breathing stayed normal. I have had a panic attack before (full on heart attack thinking kind) and this wasn't like that. I was just wondering if the heart can be spasming and yet not be arrythmic. Does that make sense? Is an anxiety attack and a panic attack the same thing? (I did post on the anxiety forum too; I just feel like it is a heart related issue so I thought I'd try it here too!!) I have mentioned that I am heading to Mayo and I would like to go up there with only the relevant chest related issues and although I FEEL like last night was one; I really honestly don't know anymore.

1030,Atenolol+hypertension,"Had a stent placed in L main coronary artery (95% blockage) 2 months ago. Prior to the stent I had been extremely athletic. Even after coronary ischemic attacks which began just before the angioplasty; I passed stress test with flying colors. After the blockage was discovered thanks to a persistent PCP; and the stent inserted; I had chest pain afterwards. Was re-catheterized; all the major arteries were given a clean bill of health; but was placed on a beta blocker. Terrible reaction to the first one; put on a second one; and finally my cardiologist took me off that one as well. Although I see some improvement; I still have chest ""aches"" on exertion.

1033,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hello*** I was wondering if anyone could provide me a little information and possibly some relief to the problem I am experiencing right now. Every night for the past week or so; when I try to fall asleep; my heart rate accelerates tremendously and pounds like crazy. Normally I never have any trouble falling asleep so this is becoming somewhat of an annoyance because I actually FEEL sleepy but because my heart beats so fast and so hard it keeps me awake. I can feel it throughtout my body and it lasts for hours. I try so hard to fall asleep that I have come up with little tricks to kind of ""pych myself out"". Like I try rolling over in different positions trying to offset the rhythm so hopefully when it starts again it will be normal. I try to clear my mind totally. After a while I will doze off; (without me knowing but I'm not complaining) but I'll wake like 45 min later only to realize that my heart is still beating as hard as ever. If I get really annoyed I'll try to stand up; walk around or go for a drink of water. But nothing helps. And I'm so sleepy. As soon as I settle back in it starts again. I have had anxiety issues in the past but I think what made it worse for me is that at first I didn't know what it was. Then once I became more aware of what an actual ""anxiety attack"" was it just kind of went away on its own. And I do admit I was dealing with a whole lot at the time. But now; on the contrary; there has been no extreme changes in my life or anything I would say I am really stressed or worried over; @ night all I pretty much want to do is sleep and I can't. It's coming to the point now that I am almost expecting my ""nightly episodes""; like I'm looking for it to start. And this is an obsession (an unhealthy one at that) that I don't care to have! The way my heart beats it feels like to me that it is pumping way too much blood throughout my body for too long of a time; my heart might burst; or I may die in my sleep. Its poisoning my thoughts and I wish I knew what to do to make it stop. I'm afraid.

1035,Atenolol+hypertension,"Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this ""discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out."" I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel ""normal"" again.

1036,Atenolol+hypertension,"I am a 53 year old female; non-smoker and have no weight problems; and no known health problems. Over the past two years; I've had numerous episodes where my body takes involuntary deep breaths; one every 7-8 minutes; interspersed with my normal breathing. The intake of breath can be when inhaling or exhaling; and it when it occurs; it disrupts a normal breath. Often the involuntary breath feels ""catchy"" as if I'd been crying or sobbing when in fact I have not. When the involuntary breaths first started; Sometimes I would go for 3 months without an episode; but then it would come back again; last for a few weeks and go away again. Within the past 4 months; I had a horrible cold; and then a bad case of bronchitis. The involuntary breathing has started up with the cold; and it is now contiunous; every 7 to 10 minutes or so. I recently had an upper endoscopy; and finished a regiment for h pylori bacteria; however this annoying problem remains. Is it possible this could be related to stess?

1038,Atenolol+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed. Has anyone else been diagnosed with Hashimoto's or hypothyroidism and suffering from long episodes of heart palpitations? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!,2009,2009,34.0,Female,hello everyon i 34 year old femal diagnos 8 month ago hypothyroid addit test diagnos hashimoto thyroid my initi tsh level 127 i i place 50 mcg levothyroxin my tsh level 48 i normal hypothyroid symptom weight gain muscl pain tired etc biggest complaint doesnt fit symptom hypo heart palpit at worst i sometim 5 6 hour day i see cardiologist ekg echocardiogram also wear 24hour heart monitor after review test cardiologist said i perfect healthi heart palpit like result hypothyroid for first month levothyroxin i honest say i not feel better howev past 6 8 week i begun feel like old self final palpit start subsid occur 3 4 hour day 1 hour day flutter i absolut elat gone within past week howev soon i woke morn i could tell i didnt feel right ive palpit episod last night last 2 hour it day sinc palpit return i scare death i go start deal they make feel aw i promis i go keep concis possibl look i appear fail has anyon els diagnos hashimoto hypothyroid suffer long episod heart palpit ani help advic would great appreci
1039,Atenolol+hypertension,I saw another post about atrial fibrillation and stomach gas possible association or connection. I too have the same thing so it may not be all in your head if your suspect this to be the case. Most dr.'s think your crazy or never heard of this when you even suggest it. Thats whats wrong with most dr's atleast in my experience in that they don't think outside the box enough possibly because this is what they learned. I think I/we can guess or prognose just as well or better than they can at times particularly if we know something about health and or ourselves and our own health. Never be afraid to speak up because I feel strongly that digestive tract problems are real and translate into other real nasty symptoms like this. Fortunately we can prevent much of this & need to prevent it from happening. I do feel the more you get afib the worse it can become either physically; emmotionally or both no matter what the cause. I thought up until now that I may have been the first to discover this but would like to know if anyone else has any real answers to this as being a connection? I would like to know how many people feel that they get atrial fibrillation and feel that it may be related to gas or full; bloated stomach; intestinal or digestive tract troubles etc? Isn't it possible that the gas; bloat; perhaps inflamed digestive or intestinal tract can disturb the vagus nerve thereby possibly causing you to go into an afib attack? Any real dr's out there any more with some real info about this? Even conjecture? Any way I also would be interested in what anyone might have to say about it and or what they may have learned from this? If you know or even think this to be the case for you I would also like to correspond with you to trade stories and info on what you''ve learned and done. Be well.

1042,Atenolol+hypertension,"There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze.

Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?,2006,2006,,,over week ago absolut identifi reason heart start skip way beat usual i go hour none sever hour ill 2 3 minut it set edg i dont know danger i went er day basic didnt care take ativan sent home today i panick call paramed came 12 lead said normal sinus one ectop i didnt go back er i normal echo 3 year ago i alreadi dont eat caffein sugar pleas reassur sympath im go insan idea what caus blue whi would sudden increas reason whatsoev
