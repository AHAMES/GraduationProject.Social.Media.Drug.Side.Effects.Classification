1,1,Amlodipine+hypertension,am a 40-year-old lady. I have been diagnosed of hypertension (200/100) since 2005. I was taking atenolol 25 mg nightly for about 2 years. In 2007; I delivered a baby boy at the age of 37. Since then; I had rapid weight gain and had shortness of breath when I walk a few steps or climb stairs. I feel uneasy to breathe when I exert. After rest; it goes off. I was continuing with atenolol 25 mg. I underwent an echo in 2008 and it was normal. I also underwent lipid profile and LDL and triglycerides were high. Since my BP was not controlled with atenolol; cardiologist suggested me to take carvedilol 6.25 mg. After 2 years; I underwent master health checkup. I underwent echo; treadmill test; chest x-ray; blood and urine tests. Again; it revealed that BP was high and LDL and triglycerides were high. Cardiologist precribed for a month to have carvedilol and anti-cholesterol medications. Even after taking all these drugs; I had the uneasiness in the chest when I exert. He suggested to undergo an angiogram. Then; I checked with another cardiologist and he changed my carvedilol to amlodipine and again the BP was same. Then he changed to a combination of atenolol and amlodipine and my BP is fine. But I still have the uneasiness in the chest when I exert; but my BP is under control other than sometimes it goes to 150/100. My thyroid functions are normal. My diabetes tests are normal. My triglycerides and LDL are still not reduced. I am now taking atorvastatin for lipids. Last 6 months; I am having severe daytime somnolence. I am working as a medical transcriptionist. My job is a stressful job. I had depression and took antidepressants for 3 months last year. After taking these; I had irregular cycles and weight gain; so I stopped them. My daytime sleepiness is so severe that I am not able to concentrate on work. I am not able to have a peaceful sleep. When I sleep at night; I feel awake the whole night with racing thoughts and I do not feel rested when I get up. I have heavy snoring too. I underwent pulmonary function tests too and it was normal. I took a chest x-ray and the doctor felt that I might have cardiomegaly. I underwent eye exam and vision is perfectly normal except for dry eyes for which I am using artificial tears. I have external hemorrhoids. Kindly suggest me as to what tests to be done for this daytime somnolence and rapid weight gain. I have checked with almost all specialties. I am confused as to what other reasons it would be.,2011,2011,40,Female,,,"['200/100', '150/100']","[40, 2, 2]",40 year old lady I diagnosed hypertension 200 100 since 2005 I taking atenolol 25 mg nightly 2 years In 2007 I delivered baby boy age 37 Since I rapid weight gain shortness breath I walk steps climb stairs I feel uneasy breathe I exert After rest goes I continuing atenolol 25 mg I underwent echo 2008 normal I also underwent lipid profile LDL triglycerides high Since BP controlled atenolol cardiologist suggested take carvedilol 6 25 mg After 2 years I underwent master health checkup I underwent echo treadmill test chest x ray blood urine tests Again revealed BP high LDL triglycerides high Cardiologist precribed month carvedilol anti cholesterol medications Even taking drugs I uneasiness chest I exert He suggested undergo angiogram Then I checked another cardiologist changed carvedilol amlodipine BP Then changed combination atenolol amlodipine BP fine But I still uneasiness chest I exert BP control sometimes goes 150 100 My thyroid functions normal My diabetes tests normal My triglycerides LDL still reduced I taking atorvastatin lipids Last 6 months I severe daytime somnolence I working medical transcriptionist My job stressful job I depression took antidepressants 3 months last year After taking I irregular cycles weight gain I stopped My daytime sleepiness severe I able concentrate work I able peaceful sleep When I sleep night I feel awake whole night racing thoughts I feel rested I get I heavy snoring I underwent pulmonary function tests normal I took chest x ray doctor felt I might cardiomegaly I underwent eye exam vision perfectly normal except dry eyes I using artificial tears I external hemorrhoids Kindly suggest tests done daytime somnolence rapid weight gain I checked almost specialties I confused reasons would,40 year old ladi I diagnos hypertens 200 100 sinc 2005 I take atenolol 25 mg nightli 2 year In 2007 I deliv babi boy age 37 sinc I rapid weight gain short breath I walk step climb stair I feel uneasi breath I exert after rest goe I continu atenolol 25 mg I underw echo 2008 normal I also underw lipid profil ldl triglycerid high sinc BP control atenolol cardiologist suggest take carvedilol 6 25 mg after 2 year I underw master health checkup I underw echo treadmil test chest x ray blood urin test again reveal BP high ldl triglycerid high cardiologist precrib month carvedilol anti cholesterol medic even take drug I uneasi chest I exert He suggest undergo angiogram then I check anoth cardiologist chang carvedilol amlodipin BP then chang combin atenolol amlodipin BP fine but I still uneasi chest I exert BP control sometim goe 150 100 My thyroid function normal My diabet test normal My triglycerid ldl still reduc I take atorvastatin lipid last 6 month I sever daytim somnol I work medic transcriptionist My job stress job I depress took antidepress 3 month last year after take I irregular cycl weight gain I stop My daytim sleepi sever I abl concentr work I abl peac sleep when I sleep night I feel awak whole night race thought I feel rest I get I heavi snore I underw pulmonari function test normal I took chest x ray doctor felt I might cardiomegali I underw eye exam vision perfectli normal except dri eye I use artifici tear I extern hemorrhoid kindli suggest test done daytim somnol rapid weight gain I check almost specialti I confus reason would,2,3,3,"[""Snoring"", ""Clouded consciousness""]","[""Hypertension"", ""Diabetes"", ""Haemorrhoid""]","[""Somnolence"", ""Depression"", ""Confusion""]"

8,8,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise.

15,15,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 40 year-old wife in recent months has undergone a number of tests following some weight loss. It transpires that she is suffering from hypertension with her 24hr ambulatory readings averaging at 170/110. Further diagnostic tests (ECG; echo and cardiac MRI) were undertaken and her cardiologist told her that her heart is enlarged (moderate) with impaired function (I believe ejection fraction in the region of 45%) but has not been able to identify the root cause of the hypertension. She is asymptomatic and does not have any issues in terms of fatigue; breathlessness; swelling; etc. She has been prescribed 5mg Amlodipine; 5mg Ramipril and 2.5mg Bisprolol. The Cardiologist has told her she will be on medication for longevity and that improving the condition will take a long time. Her blood pressure has already come down to 132/84 which the cardiologist was very pleased with. She will be seeing him again in 8/9 weeks with a follow up echo in 4/5 months.

Harley's bp are high and he's on the highest doses of medication they can give him. Because of the hypertension and now a heart murmurs the vet feels that giving him subq fluids will do more harm than good. Has anyone else found a way to balance fluids with hypertension? His creatinine level is 3.8; BUN is 96 and phosphorous is 9 all which have doubled in the past week and with BP's around 160/100. He's on encard; enalapril; Amlodipine; Epakatin and Pepcid.

18,18,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi doctor; Firstly thankyou in advance for your service. I am a 26 year old female; 125lbs 5'5''; non-smoker. I was diagnosed as having Hypertension when I was 23; no family history of any cardiac problems. I had all the routine tests to rule out secondary causes and was therefore diagnosed as having essential/primary hypertension and commenced on Losartan; my BP remained uncontrolled running about 150/100 and throughout numerous months my medication was changed; finally settling at 100mg Losartan and 10mg Amlodipine which kept my BP controlled at around 120/70. I have recently had a baby and my BP again became very uncontrolled at the end of pregnancy and I was induced; my BP remained high after the birth between 140-160/100-110 and 4 weeks later I had a suspected TIA were I lost feeling down my left side and had diffilculty speaking; this episode lasted around 2minutes in total. I have since been under going routine tests to confirm or rule out a TIA and was commenced on aspirin. The MRI and Carotid artery ultrasound were negative and the Echo/TOE (TEE) showed my heart was fine except the presense of a 'small hole' my doctor said the hole is very common and that they do not think there is any need to close it. My questions to you are: Is it likely the small hole is a PFO? Could there be any relation between the PFO and my unexplained hypertension in someone my age? Is the presense of a PFO enough evidence to confirm a TIA? Would Hypertension and a PFO increase the risk of stroke/TIA in the future? What would be your advice?

25,25,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was diagnosed with hypertension about two months ago; but I'm still in the 'find the right drug' hunt. I have been on 100mg of atenelol since the beginning; but that only gets me to about 155/90 on avg. My doctor (who I have a lot of confidence in) has tried to add first Lysinoprol(sp); which made me sick; and now nifedipine (30mg). The nifedipine actually controls the bp (140/80 on avg); but after a week it too has side affects (nausea; fautigue; flushing) i can't live with for long. My complication is that I have borderline hyponatremia; so my doctor is uncomfortable prescribing a diuretic till I see an endocrinologist. I should add I was worked up a couple of times for the hyponatremia and no secondary causes were identified. My doctor appreciates me being an active participant in my treatment; so my question is what are some other good bp medicine options for those with apparently sensitive systems? Dear Bill There are several other potential blood pressure medications that your doctor could try. No one can say whether you will react to them ahead of time. You were on nifedipine; but there are several other types of calcium channel blockers; such as amlodipine. There are other ACE inhibitors other than lisinopril. There is also a newer class of high blood pressure medications called the angiotensin receptor blockers; that are similar to ACE inhibitors. These are just some of the options you could discuss with your doctor. I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck.

34,34,Amlodipine+hypertension,After 2 years of angina; I was diagnosed in 6/08 with coronary vasospasms/Prinzmetal's angina (suspected diagnosis; no angio w/ergonovine). Anxiety; GERD; mitrovalve prolapse ruled out. Have had thallium stress test; several stress echoes; exercise treadmill; several EKG's all normal. Holter has shown some PVC's but nothing of note. I was given Amlodipine and gradually increased to 20 mg/day which has decreased my angina attacks to a couple of times a month; a remarkable improvement. For the past few months (probably since the increase to 10mg) I have noticed my resting heart rate has gone from 69-73 bpm to the high 90's. When I am doing simple things like cooking; it raises to 110-115. My BP is now well into a normal range (diagnosed with hypertension several years ago) but the heart rate is higher. I was hospitalized about a month ago when my resting rate was 132 and discharged when it gradually went back to 105 with no explanation. My potassium is low at times but I have been taking a prescribed potassium supplement daily with no change to heart rate.

35,35,Amlodipine+hypertension,My BP was well-controlled on 100 mg Losartin and 7.5 mg Amlodipine; averaging around 125/68. At peak exertion; during a treadmill stress test recently; my systolic BP reached 215. My cardiologist subbed 5 mg Nebivolol for the Amlodipine due to what he described as exercise-related hypertension. I took this medication for a week and experienced a range of unpleasant side effects; including exhaustion; significant depression and reduced heart rate (mid-60s; compared with my normal mid-80s). I've been off the Nebivolol for five days; but I'm still experiencing these side effects. My heart rate has only come back to about 67-68. Given the half-life of this drug and the fact that I only took it for a week; these side effects seem excessive. Has anyone here had a similar experience?

45,45,Amlodipine+hypertension,As from 22 Dec 2011; I had some discomforts consistent with high BP. Checked BP personally on an OMRON digital equipment which showed 98 /176. Doctor check and read 95 / 170. Had been taking Losar 25 (Losartan Potassium IP). Doctor increased the dosage to Losar 25x2 +Amlodipine Basilate 5mg. Still not much relief in the discomfort level. At random I have a kind of heaviness on my head; a feeling consistent with a person taking strong wine giving a post-feeling muscle pull on the face.(I do not drink or smoke). Also a kind of numbness is also felt at times. Discomfort or pain in the back and left side of head is felt (infrequent). Did an MRI Scan on 20 Jan 2012. 'Findings': T2 & FLAIR hyperintensities noted in bilateral fronto-parietal periventricular white-matter.

46,46,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; First of all i would like to thank you or anyone for answering my question. I guess i have always had high blood pressure; recently at the doctors my blood pressure was 170/101 ; high? Yes; very high. I was given a medication; Amlodipine Besyl 2.5 mg tab. I was wondering if there are any great adverse side effects to this medicine? I know its good to take a healthy lifestyle to get my blood pressure down and it would just be good overall for everything. Would hypertension be one of the reasons to cause a sort of chronic fatigue? Also; if you know this; but does hypertension play a big role on your immune system or bodies ability to make antibodies?

53,53,Amlodipine+hypertension,My 3 1/2 yr old grandson has high blood pressure (180/120 when not on amlodipine); abdominal pain usually radiating from the umbilicus; extremity (usually leg) numbness to the point of occasional collapse; loss of appetite; weight loss; sometimes naussea and/or diarrhea. He has also had episodes of temporary blindness. This all began to manifest this summer (1 month after he turned 3 yrs. old). Prior to that he seemed to be a bright healthy happy child. In retrospect he may have been having intermittant spells of abdominal pain associated with this for several months before his first hospitalization in August 2007 as well as rapid onset (2 weeks) of a lazy eye in the spring of 2007 which may or may not be associated. He has now been hospitalized 4 times at Texas Children's Hospital. He has 5 doctors: pediatrician; renal; g.i.; neuro; and an opthamalogist. He is on Amlodipine daily; Zofran as needed; and most recently Periactin daily. He has had numerous head and abdominal CT scans with and without contrast; MRI's; Ultrasound; DMSA(?); 24 hrs. urinalysis; blood work. They can't find the cause of any of the symptoms. We've been through many diagnoses including acid reflux; psychosomatic pain for attention; Mesenteric Lymphadenitis; possible pheochromocytoma; inflammation of the brain and the latest is possibly abdominal migraines. Recently a friend's daughter was diagnosed with Addison's Syndrome and they have many of the same symptoms. Do you have any suggestions and in your opinion should we ask about seeing an Endocrinologist. One of the problems with so many doctors and Texas Children's Hospital is that each doctor seems to be just looking at their piece of the pie and have not yet all gotten together to compare notes.

54,54,Amlodipine+hypertension,"2009: episodes of chest pain; leading to cardiac cath with diagnosis of Prinzmetal's . Was started on amlodipine 5mg daily; continuation of Benicar 40mg daily (for chronic hypertension) and aspirin 325mg daily. This was effective. April 2013: intermittent bilateral arm pain; starting near elbows and within 5 seconds or so; involves total arms; hands and fingers and fine motor movements totally impaired. This intense pain lasts about 3-5 minutes; episodes 2-4 times a week. Interventional Cardiologist ordered thallium treadmill test; and stated that no cardiac damage seen. Amlodipine changed to 5mg twice daily; nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg prn; L-Arginine 4000mg twice daily and red yeast rice 2 capsules daily. I do not eat red meat or fried foods. No relief of symptoms. Isosorbide dinitrate 30mg started; no relief. Changed to Isosorbide mononitrate 30mg; No relief. Developed hacking cough lasting 2 months after isosorbide mononitrate discontinued. From April 2013 to January 2014 the episodes occurred 2-4 times a week. Then I did not have any more spasms until March 17; 2014. Since then I have had at least five a week; three days ago; I had three episodes. I understand that there is provocative testing during cardiac cath that involves inducing coronary artery spasm to ID the offending artery; and then that artery can be stented. The spasm can be rescued by intravenous nitroglycerin. My Interventional Cardiologist will not do this. I have not had any CHEST PAIN since 2009.

58,58,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 ; ie High normal .. I didn't panic and I started to work on my lifestyle but nothing improved . After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings was always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist because I was obsessed with the idea of being hypertensive at this age ; 24 . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal (ranging bet . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and live my life normally and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were always ideal most of the time until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! The chest pain and palpitations frustrated me and I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Heart Ultrasound ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) The doctor ended up diagnosing essential hypertension after excluding a 2ry one especially after I made a kidney Ultrasound which was normal also . He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!!! I went to many doctors as you can see but no one could tell me what I am suffering from !!! I have been living in a misery for the past year and a half and don't really know what to do ??!! The doctors kept telling me that I am Ok and there is nothing to worry about ; but I am not Ok .

59,59,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi All - new on here. I have had three episodes of AF (July 06; Jan 08 and Feb 08); first treated with IV Flecanaide but the doctors are unwilling to use that again; so have put me on Amiodarone; Bisoprolol and Warfarin; on top of the meds I was already taking (Amlodipine; Losartan; Simvastatin); which seem to make me very tired and lethargic all of the time; and also very 'constricted' - even gentle excercise makes my chest tight and breathing difficult; and when I stand from sitting or crouching I nearly pass out. The consultant has discussed the topic of Ablation very briefly; but I think there are other tests they could do first? (treadmill; 48/72 hour heart trace) I should mention that I also have thickening of the heart wall muscle; which they are not sure about (could have been caused by hypertension or could be HCM) - I have had a cardiac MRI last month so that might help when I see the results. Can anyone shed any light or offer any suggestions about this? I was led to understand that the Ablation; if successful; could enable me to come off some of the medication I am on; which might let me get back to excercising normally again. I am only 50 years old and up to these latest episodes fit and active (golf; squash; cycling etc; none of which I can do atm); so all this is a bit of a pain as you can imagine.

Day 52 spotting again days passed minimal bleeding but not red brownish lasted for 3 days took duvadilan and duphaston since then. It will stop and few days after back with spottings only when I go up and down stairs. Then nearly 9 weeks had spotting led to cramping and minimal bleeding to light red bleeding. With some sort of a tissue comes out with it. Next day had my 1st meeting with the OB. Told her the situation and I had TVUS done and she said no trace of pregnancy. Here is the result of TVUS Impression: normal sized anteverted uterus with intact endometrium normal ovaries with corpus luteum on the right. (BTW; I have history of Ectopic pregnancy years ago and took my left fallopian tube). Going back; she just prescribed me with ferrous sulfate and continue with my previous mantainance meds LoSartan and amlodipine since I have diabetes and hypertension. And ask me to have my CBC since I'm bleeding and BHCG. Coz she said she couldn't see any sign of pregnancy. Or I already ad Early Miscarriage.

72,72,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Doc; I am 20; and was found to have hypertension (140~160/90~110); and my diastolic was known to go up to 128...I was a regular blood donor for 3 years; so my hypertension was a sudden one... My doctor initially thought I had Thyrotoxicosis/Hyperthyroidism; because in addition to the sudden pressure; I had sweaty palms; tremors; eye-nipping and a systolic murmur... My TSH; T4 and T3 levels were normal... I also tested negative for Pheochromocytoma; Renal Artery Stenosis and Conn's...MRI/Ultrasound showed nothing significant; although my doctor thinks my adrenal glands look bulky... My tremors have since become quite bad...They tremble so badly I am actually aware of it. Sometimes my whole limb is trembling so badly; I feel my whole body tremble as well...And when Im nervous (Im taking a public speaking class; and I have to give weekly speeches); it becomes very bad; and I can't even hold anything; and my legs tremble too...And I get numbness in my fingers; and sudden pain in my legs for no reason... Last night when I went to sleep; I saw flashes of lights in fornt of my eyes for a few minutes; and I seem to occasionally drool when I lie down... I am now on Norvasc (Amlodipine) 5mg OD; and Diovan (Valsartan) 160mg OD...Pressure pretty well controlled... Could my initial TSH; T4 and T3 levels be wrong ie a false negative? Or could my symptoms be because of something else or due to my medication? By the way; the doctor wants me to get tested for Porphyria... Please advise.

In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Warfarin related clinical trial back in 8/09. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain.

Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment? Shouldn’t she be taking BP meds other than statins; especially while on Warfarin? And isn’t Warfarin possibly contra-indicated by her history?

75,75,Amlodipine+hypertension,Dear Dr. ; From about a year and a half ago I began to experience an increase in my blood pressure .. It was ranging from 135-150/90-100 .. After a couple of months ; during which it stayed on the borderline ; my blood pressure went up to 160-170/90-110 where I started to follow up with an internist who suggested a regimen of Amlor (Norvasc) (Amlodipine) 5mg daily for a couple of months . I began to improve and kept taking the Amlor for 3 months during which my blood pressure went down significantly and the readings were always ideal . I also consulted a cardiologist . He told me to stop taking the Amlor (after 3 months) and suggested an ABP for 24 hours and 45% of the readings was high normal . He told me that I don't have Hypertension and that the fluctuation in the readings are sometimes normal and could happen to anyone . He also told me to stop the medication and refer back to him if something happened . I followed his instructions and since then ; I didn't experience any high blood pressure symptoms . My readings were Ok until last months were I began to experience the same symptoms I had before : headache episodes that don't last long ; temporary feeling of load and stress around my head and eyes PLUS palpitations and right side chest pain !!! I consulted another cardiologist who asked for : 1) ABP ( The readings where elevated like the previous one ) 2) Blood tests ( Normal Cholesterol ; TSH ; Random blood sugar ; Sodium and potassium levels ) 3) ECG ( shows a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy ) 4) Echocardiogram ( shows normal heart chambers and valves and NO LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY ) 5) Kidney Ultrasound ( No stenosis or Kidney issue ; so the Dr. excluded a 2ry hypertension ) He prescribed Amlor again for me which improved me for a week after which my blood pressure went up again despite taking the medication . The readings now are 130-145/85-95 while I am on the Amlor regimen . I don't know what to do ?!

78,78,Amlodipine+hypertension,I was put on BP medication in January 2012. I started off with Amlodipine and Lisinopril and the Lisinopril darned near killed me. The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take me off it so I just stopped taking it and made an appointment with another doctor. I have been taking 12.5 mg of Metoprolol and 10 mg Amlodipine for about 3 months. I have COPD and something was aggravating my breathing problems. I went to the doctor yesterday and he took me off the Metoprolol and put me on 100 mg of Losartan. He told me to just stop taking the Metoprolol. I questioned starting off with such a high dose of Losartan. I seem to be very sensitive to these medications and felt starting right off with 100 mg was a bit high. Everything I've read online suggests people are usually started off with 50 mg. I questioned just stopping Metoprolol suddenly. Both questions were fobbed off. I took my first dose of Losartan at 6:30 this morning. I always take the Amlodipine at 8 p.m. so it will be due in about an hour. A short time ago I suddenly had a terrible spell. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to get my breathing going even with my nebulizer. I felt like my BP went up; my ears felt like they were burning. This spell lasted about 15 minutes; fast heart rate. Should the Losartan have stepped in where the Metoprolol left off and kept me from having a rebound effect? Can anyone comment on this or offer me any advice? If I had it to do over; I would take my chances with controlling my high blood pressure naturally and would not put this toxic stuff into my body because I've done a lot of research and reading over the past six months and the more I read the more scared I get about all the junk I've been feeding myself.,2008,2012,,Female,,,[],[],I put BP medication January 2012 I started Amlodipine Lisinopril Lisinopril darned near killed The prescribing doctor WOULD NOT take I stopped taking made appointment another doctor I taking 12 5 mg Metoprolol 10 mg Amlodipine 3 months I COPD something aggravating breathing problems I went doctor yesterday took Metoprolol put 100 mg Losartan He told stop taking Metoprolol I questioned starting high dose Losartan I seem sensitive medications felt starting right 100 mg bit high Everything I read online suggests people usually started 50 mg I questioned stopping Metoprolol suddenly Both questions fobbed I took first dose Losartan 6 30 morning I always take Amlodipine 8 p due hour A short time ago I suddenly terrible spell I felt like I going able get breathing going even nebulizer I felt like BP went ears felt like burning This spell lasted 15 minutes fast heart rate Should Losartan stepped Metoprolol left kept rebound effect Can anyone comment offer advice If I I would take chances controlling high blood pressure naturally would put toxic stuff body I done lot research reading past six months I read scared I get junk I feeding,I put BP medic januari 2012 I start amlodipin lisinopril lisinopril darn near kill the prescrib doctor would not take I stop take made appoint anoth doctor I take 12 5 mg metoprolol 10 mg amlodipin 3 month I copd someth aggrav breath problem I went doctor yesterday took metoprolol put 100 mg losartan He told stop take metoprolol I question start high dose losartan I seem sensit medic felt start right 100 mg bit high everyth I read onlin suggest peopl usual start 50 mg I question stop metoprolol suddenli both question fob I took first dose losartan 6 30 morn I alway take amlodipin 8 p due hour A short time ago I suddenli terribl spell I felt like I go abl get breath go even nebul I felt like BP went ear felt like burn thi spell last 15 minut fast heart rate should losartan step metoprolol left kept rebound effect can anyon comment offer advic If I I would take chanc control high blood pressur natur would put toxic stuff bodi I done lot research read past six month I read scare I get junk I feed,2,2,0,"[""Spells"", ""Burning sensation""]","[""COPD NOS"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy""]",[]

I am young (just turned 21!); but was diagnosed with sudden quite high hypertension (sometimes up to 160/128); which till today; doctors are adamant is caused by a secondary cause. But nobody can put a finger to what is the secondary cause. Have no family history; am female; and my BMI is 20. Have been a top student all this while; and have represented my state for national's in debate. Also active in public speeches etc. Lately; have started trembling real bad. Used to get trembling when I had to speak in front of public; but it goes away about a minute into speech. But now I tremble all the way; until the podium shakes; and even 15 minutes AFTER speech; I still tremble so badly I cant hold even a bottle of water. It affects mostly my left side of the body. Like yestedray; all through the day; my left thumb was trembling; even when I was resting my entire arm on the table. If I apply pressure to my thumb to stay still; I can see the vein (or whatever you call it) pulsating. Is this just a bad case of anxiety or is something wrong?

84,84,Amlodipine+hypertension,I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain?

I have been on Telmisartan 40mg for few weeks but it killed my sex drive entirely. I stopped taking it & gradually recovered from low libido. Also i've noticed a general decline in libido & an onset of ED after i crossed age 40. Now my libido is not that strong as it used to be 4 years back even without medicine.

Now he has prescribed me a combination drug (telmisartan 40mg + amlodipine 5mg) once a day. I'm really worried if it would again target my libido in a negative way.

91,91,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 20 and was diagnosed with pretty high hypertension (140~160/90~110) last year; of sudden onset. I am on Diovan 160mg (Valsartan) and Norvasc 5mg(Amlodipine); both once a day. BP is controlled most times of the day. Doctors initially thought I had thyrotoxicosis; as I had the symptoms and negative history for hypertension; and my BMI is 20.5. Tests showed normal levels of TSH; T4 and T3. My tremors of both hands; palpitations and sweaty palms are kinda getting more obvious. Morover; I seem to be getting cramps here and there; and my fingers get all tingly and numb.

She has been hospitalized 3 times in the last 3 years. The last time she was hospitalized it took 3 days to bring down her blood pressure which was at 180/120. Also the last time she was hospitalized in addition to chest pain she also had extreme pain on the right side of her lower back to the point where she could not bend over. She takes a daily dose of 20mg of Accupril and has for years. Except for when she has bouts of this condition her blood pressure is normal and she feels and looks very healthy. The attacks come without warning and no reason for them has been given. She feels absolutely awful when they come. She usually walks 3.5 miles per day and has for a year and feels well. After her last hospitalization she was sent home with Amlodipine Besylate 5MG. Each time she was treated she had a battery of blood work (numerous vials) in an attempt to find the cause. She was checked for a heart attack and also had a stress test. None of these have pinpointed a cause. She was also given needles to try and being down her blood pressure; I don't know the names of what they were. The pain in her chest is below breast; by rib cage. Each time she is sent home after her blood pressure is finally stabilized. After 6 months or sometimes a year it all comes back again without warning.

I went back to the Atenolol at 25mg which immediately stopped the above mentioned issues; so clearly causitive. I had not had any arrhythmia problems before taking Atenolol.

(I'm now totally sober). I have excruciating stabbing jolts of pain that feel as though someone is inside my head with a hammer and spike. the hammering is in sync with the beat of the heart. I can have any where from 1 to 4 strikes within a 4 to 5 second period. If the blood pressure is to high; any slight movement will trigger the strikes. If I think of something that makes me angry; in an instant the strikes occur. Each excruciating strike sends numb shocks through out the whole body. the higher my diastolic number; the more intense the strikes with no pain in between strikes. If the doctor shines that little red colored light in my eye to check pupil dialation; I get immediate sever and unbareable strikes and go into convulsions (violent uncontrollable disturbances of the body). My entire body jolts to the beat of the headache strikes. The strikes are so bad; they stop me in my tracks and I'm forced to the ground. I'm a 49 year old male. I had a trucking accident in 05 and 3 epidurals and 1 lamenectomy diskectomy in 08 leaving me with disk deteriation and expanding scar tissue at L-3 L-4 along with radiculopathy running down my left leg. I also have a 5mm herniation at L-5 S-1. I went to the ""world famous"" Cleveland Clinic and was seen by neurologist Dr Stewart Tepper. I was in his office every bit of 3 minutes and he said it was from taking to many percoset and sent me to detox. Well; that was 2 years ago. I stopped taking percoset and still have the disease. So much for percoset being the cause. One doctor called it ""stabs and jabs""; another doctor called it ""electrical discharge headaches""; another doctor called it ""cluster headaches"". A previous doctor prescribed ""indomethecin""; however Dr Stewart Tepper said stop taking it along with the percoset. If I keep my blood pressure under control; all I have are intermittent numb shocks in my head and body but no pain. I currently take clonidine for the hypertension along with propanolol; amlodipine;(which does absolutely nothing for my hypertension) and hydrochlorothiazide.

102,102,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; my old tom cat who is 20 and arthritic and fairly deaf has recently gone suddenly blind. We have taken him to the vet who said he has hypertension (he was already on treatment for kidney disease) and he is now on amolodipine. The vet said he has responded well to the kidney treatment and seems otherwise healthy and should adapt to his blindness in 3-4 weeks. My problem is he has given up trying to find his litter tray/food/water and howls (he did this as he went deaf but it is now more frequent). He will stand up and urinate on anything he is sleeping on and I am constantly taking him to his litter tray/ food/ water (He is eating and drinking well once placed there but howls until I check his needs rather than trying to find anything himself). He is generally mopey. In the morning I have to bathe him as he has sat in his own urine. I guess my worry is that I should not be putting him through all this and he will be on his own most of the day as I work full time normally.

103,103,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 62 years old and have been treated for high BP for over 15 years. I have been taking Toporal XR 25 mg. 3x qd; H ydrochlorathizide 5mg 1x qd for the last 2 years. I woke up Tuesday morning with my head spinning; very dizzy. I took my BP and it was 180/111 pulse 55. This whole week it has stayed between 160/100 to higher and the pulse lower than I have ever had. I went to the doctor; could not see my regular doc but saw the one handling urgent care Thursday. My left leg has been very painful for several months; worse behind the knee. She x-rayed my knee and saw arthritis ; which I knew was there. I have arthritis both kinds. Have taken 800 mg Ibuprofen for the pain; try not to take it often as I know it elevates BP and harmful to body. I also take aspirin; tylenol; and wear a Flector pain patch when it gets unbearable. I alternate with the pain meds dont take them the same days. The doctor put me on Tramadol for pain and made an appt. with my regular MD April 5th. I am scared because heart disease runs in my family; hypertension and stroke; some diabetes. I feel it would be wise for me to see my orthopaedist about my leg and see a specialist about my BP; cardiologist maybe. I have a heart murmur have since childhood; leaky valve; mitral valve prolapse. I also take meds for hypothyroid; depression (sertraline hcl); anxiety (PTSD); skelaxin; prn cyclobenzaprine (not with other meds); now tramadol hcl. Can someone validate my concern about waiting?

104,104,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi I’m 25 year old and weight 169 and I’m 5 10. My blood type is A and I consume a lot of red meat. I’m slightly active; I play soccer once a week and go for walking 3 days a week. I would like to give you a brief history of my medical issues within the past 6 years and get some advice. Back when I was 19; I got a very bad flu that I never experienced in my life before. I was sick for two weeks and even after I got better; I felt my hands and legs were numb and I felt general weakness. Since then; I started experiencing pressure and pain on the left side of my chest. This was something new to me. A few months later; I went for a doctor check up and I was told that my blood pressure was in pre hypertension range. Since then; every time that I went to doctor; my BP was in pre hypertension and my doctor recommended me to be physically active. Within the last 6 years; I was just not feeling right. I was confused (cloudy mind); experiencing lightheadedness; and dizziness; I felt pain on the left side of my chest radiating to my left shoulder and left hand all the time. Starting in 2009; I have been seeing my doctor regularly and he has tried different BP medication on me. Currently; I’m on two medications; one is Amlodipine Besylate 7.5 MG (Norvasc) and the other medication is Paroxetine HCL 20 MG. I take them daily. Every time I saw my doctor my BP was still high (150s / 90s) and he was surprised and suggested I try the 24 hour BP monitor. I did that and the result was interesting; 98% of time; my BP was under 140/90 and only 4 readings were high. The overall average was 122/74 and during the awake time; it was 125/77 and during the sleep time; it was 109/60. So he recommended me to continue taking my medications. I have also done two EKGs; Chest X-ray; different Blood tests; and chest MRI and the results for all are normal. The only thing that was slightly elevated was my cholesterol and doctor recommended me to exercise and do diet change. I was also referred to a cardiologist and after doing an EKG; I was told that my heart is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with it. So I’m still taking my two medications but however; I still have the pain on my left chest and left shoulder and hand. One thing I have realized recently is that I’ve been running more and I’ve been feeling a little better. It seems that my pain reduced during my running and a few hours after I run. Could you tell me what is the cause of this pain? Can blood pressure cause this pain? Do I have to go for more Heart-related tests? What else do I need to do in order to get ride of the pain? Is it something else that causes this pain? I would appreciate your help and please let me know if you need further info.,2010,2010,25,Male,,,"['140/90', '122/74', '125/77', '109/60']","[25, 6, 6]",Hi I 25 year old weight 169 I 5 10 My blood type A I consume lot red meat I slightly active I play soccer week go walking 3 days week I would like give brief history medical issues within past 6 years get advice Back I 19 I got bad flu I never experienced life I sick two weeks even I got better I felt hands legs numb I felt general weakness Since I started experiencing pressure pain left side chest This something new A months later I went doctor check I told blood pressure pre hypertension range Since every time I went doctor BP pre hypertension doctor recommended physically active Within last 6 years I feeling right I confused cloudy mind experiencing lightheadedness dizziness I felt pain left side chest radiating left shoulder left hand time Starting 2009 I seeing doctor regularly tried different BP medication Currently I two medications one Amlodipine Besylate 7 5 MG Norvasc medication Paroxetine HCL 20 MG I take daily Every time I saw doctor BP still high 150s 90s surprised suggested I try 24 hour BP monitor I result interesting 98 time BP 140 90 4 readings high The overall average 122 74 awake time 125 77 sleep time 109 60 So recommended continue taking medications I also done two EKGs Chest X ray different Blood tests chest MRI results normal The thing slightly elevated cholesterol doctor recommended exercise diet change I also referred cardiologist EKG I told heart perfectly fine nothing wrong So I still taking two medications however I still pain left chest left shoulder hand One thing I realized recently I running I feeling little better It seems pain reduced running hours I run Could tell cause pain Can blood pressure cause pain Do I go Heart related tests What else I need order get ride pain Is something else causes pain I would appreciate help please let know need info,Hi I 25 year old weight 169 I 5 10 My blood type A I consum lot red meat I slightli activ I play soccer week go walk 3 day week I would like give brief histori medic issu within past 6 year get advic back I 19 I got bad flu I never experienc life I sick two week even I got better I felt hand leg numb I felt gener weak sinc I start experienc pressur pain left side chest thi someth new A month later I went doctor check I told blood pressur pre hypertens rang sinc everi time I went doctor BP pre hypertens doctor recommend physic activ within last 6 year I feel right I confus cloudi mind experienc lightheaded dizzi I felt pain left side chest radiat left shoulder left hand time start 2009 I see doctor regularli tri differ BP medic current I two medic one amlodipin besyl 7 5 MG norvasc medic paroxetin hcl 20 MG I take daili everi time I saw doctor BP still high 150 90 surpris suggest I tri 24 hour BP monitor I result interest 98 time BP 140 90 4 read high the overal averag 122 74 awak time 125 77 sleep time 109 60 So recommend continu take medic I also done two ekg chest X ray differ blood test chest mri result normal the thing slightli elev cholesterol doctor recommend exercis diet chang I also refer cardiologist ekg I told heart perfectli fine noth wrong So I still take two medic howev I still pain left chest left shoulder hand one thing I realiz recent I run I feel littl better It seem pain reduc run hour I run could tell caus pain can blood pressur caus pain Do I go heart relat test what els I need order get ride pain Is someth els caus pain I would appreci help pleas let know need info,6,4,1,"[""Illness"", ""Numbness"", ""Pain"", ""Weakness"", ""Clouded consciousness"", ""Lightheadedness""]","[""Erythema"", ""Influenza"", ""Hypertension"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy""]","[""Confusion""]"
105,105,Amlodipine+hypertension,Recently I was dignosed with High Blood Pressure. My previous doctor recognized it was high back in December. I went to a doctor late in May. She diagnosed me with HBP. My readings have been like 156/85 and as high as 167/90. I have been on Benazepril since May. I have felt better ever since taking the medicine no doubt. Not one single headache and I generally feel better. My blood pressure had went down a little on my last vist. It was about 148/84. The doctor still saw the need to put me on another medication; so now im taking Benazepril and Amlodipine. And at times checking my BP myself it has been down to like 127/80. Im only 24 and thats what worries me. I have a family history of High Blood Pressue big time. My Grandad and Dad both had it. My Dads was so high; at the time they couldnt even maintain it. Im also overweight. During my first visit to the doc I weighed about 250 at 6 feet tall. Most of my fat is central; stored in my stomach. Since then Ive been working out and running. I was down to 226 during my last visit. Ive changed by diet up and have become more active. Besides adding another medication; the doc also did a bunch of bloodwork. My CBC and all blood work; including thryoid function and ALL of that other stuff was all normal. Except my urine test. A small amount of protein showed up in my urine. And she recommended that I get an Ultrasound of my kidneys and abdomen. I didnt have the money to get it done between the last 2 visits. And she still wants it done. She kind of worried me big time that somethine may be fatally wrong with my kidneys. It may be my kidneys causing my HBP. Or is it my HBP causing protein in my urine and kidney problems??? Im worried to death now; at only 24 years old. I have a bit of anxiety at times and dont really know what to think. Im having the ulrasound done in a week. What are the common reasons for the problems im having here. Im overweight and have a fam history of HBP. But could my one case be different?? Could my kidneys be failing?? Ive never had any problems really. I get sharp pains in my right side sometimes. Appendicitis was ruled out a while back. My sister also has problems like this as well. I never have problems urinating either. Except I go ALOT when I drink a ton of water or beer. But Ive always been like that. And my mom is like that too. So i never looked into that much. But anyone got any advice???

108,108,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am 30 yr; otherwise healthy male. I have been diagnosed with hypertension 4 years back. My family has the history of hypertension; running from generations. Initially was put on temisartan 40mg by Doc; used it for 3-4 months and later dosage was reduced to 20mg but later switched to another medicine; olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide (20+12.5) and since then using the same tablet till recently My readings were pretty normal and infact my doc was convinced and wanted to reduce my dosage to only olmesartan medoxomil. Of late i have developed severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks; so started using Inderal 20 on the advice of Psychiatrist. I bought a bp monitor and started checking at home regularly and maintain a chart. Almost always my readings are well within the normal range (<130/80). Every time i check blood pressure; i get panicky but luckily it never really affected readings. This incident happened 3 days back; when i checked bp in the evening the results were 121/75 (left hand) and 127/78 (right hand). I was startled to see a difference in both the arms; and i remember reading somewhere that difference in readings in both hands could indicate a some serious health problem. That very thought made me so panicky; i ended up checking readings on my right arm 2 more times in quick succession. Readings were ; 135/80 and 141/82. I got so scared and so restless. That night i had to go to a party and had one drink and lot of chicken as i couldn't resist my friends. I came home late night; couldn't sleep for a long time. Next morning i checked my blood pressure after taking regular medication (olmesartan 20); it showed 147/94 on right hand and 130/80 left hand; immediately i took inderal 20 to calm down. After a while i checked it was 151/101; i became extremely panicky and rushed to local medical centre. I explained to the doc all the happenings and how my readings were always in the desired range. When he checked on (right hand) the readings were 150/90; he said not to worry and hurry and asked me to continue medication and come after a week for revision. His words calmed me down. Took another dose Inderal 20mg before going to bed that night. I had this constant fear and unsettlingfeeling that i might stroke out or have an attack. Sleeping has become such a pain and could only manage 6 hrs of sleep that night. Yesterday; i took regular medication but suffered a severe panic attack as i was constantly worrying about my raised blood pressure levels. I dreaded to check my bp but somehow managed to check and the readings were 146/85 in the noon and 149/85 in the evening; I tried to relax and stay calm but the thoughts went wild and had to visit my regular doctor. Readings came out to be 150/100 but he was cool about it and asked me not to panic. He changed medication (after using it for 3 years) to olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine (20+5) and said he will try and titrate medication until the desired levels are achieved. He asked me not to check bp at home and relax and asked me to stop taking Inderal. Please tell me if i am in some real danger; i am unable to calm myself down. Why did my blood pressure shot up suddenly and stayed put at those levels!!! Please please suggest me what can i do to come out this panic and depressing mode of life.

111,111,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a male 40 years with slight hypertension for which I am taking S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg). My height is 5 feet 10 inches; weight is 75 kg. I had bad asthma for 2 years which was treated with asthalin inhaler but I no longer have it nor do I use the inhaler or any other medication for asthma. I am a software engineer by profession. Fitnesswise - I can do about 40 pushups and jog for 30 minutes non stop. I have two problems - dry skin and insomnia; listing them both since I am not sure if they are related. The dry skin problem is nothing new I have had dry skin (extreme dandruff) on scalp; beard; etc. but the problem has gotten worse lately. lately the skin under chin becomes reddish (raw) easily after shaving and burns slightly. The other major problem is that I seem to only be able to sleep when I am extremely tired (been without sleep for long time); I also get disturbed sleep; Many times I go to bed at 11 pm but only get sleep at around 4 am; I then wake up at around 1.30 pm. I get very realistic dreams and disturbed sleep; nose gets blocked at night sometimes. After waking up - I dont feel very rested; I have difficulty concentrating; eye lids feel heavy; lazy. I saw a doctor who conducted some tests for the sleep issue. According to the tests - Vitamin; E; D count is low; triglyceride and esinophil count is slightly high. Bp; Sugar; ecg; thyroid are normal. The doctor recommended vitamin D; E supplements and some tablets for the esinophil which I completed the entire course. Another doctor recommended sertagress - 25 (Sertaline HCL 25 mg) and Ativan 1 mg (lorazepam 1 mg) tablets which I took for 6 months but they were not helping; had nasty side effects and I still had sleep issues; thus I tapered them off over 3 months. I am no longer taking sertagress or any sleep medicine. During school time the doctor diagnosed sleep issue to be caused by high blood pressure (hypertension) He recommended S-Numlo 5 (S-Amlodipine 5 mg) tablets which I am taking even now and since 15 years. My blood pressure is almost always around 130-90. the aggravagated insomnia problem is there for almost 2 years now.

112,112,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hello; I was told about a year ago that the walls of my left ventricle were slightly thickened. I had a full cardiac workup done. I had extensive blood tests; stress test; echo; holter monitor and ecg. A few months later another echo and then the test were they go down your esophagus to look at the heart. I can't remember the name of it. The last tests showed that the thickness had come down close to normal. The cardiologists I had seen told me I may have had a virus or high blood pressure that caused the problem. Anyway they told me I should be fine and to go on with my normal life and I should not have any problems. My question is that I have done some bodybuilding and am very active. I am 26 with normal blood pressure and cholesteral levels and I do not smoke. I was wondering if I am at a risk of sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest because of this. I have had a lot of anxiety over this and have some skipped heart beats now and then. I am worried when working out or when I am active I am going drop dead.

120,120,Amlodipine+hypertension,My doctor diagnosed me with anxiety/depression. The thing is; he diagnosed me with this condition after spending only less than 5 minutes in the exam room with me. My concern is that it may actually be my heart. (I recently started a hypertension medicine (amlodipine)). Most times I feel fine. But lately I've been having issues with running out of breath easily with activity (although I am 300lb; so I know that does have something to do with it); occasional chest pressure; and starting today my left arm feels very heavy. I also have been having a churning feeling in my stomach the past 2 days along with indigestion. Since I'm worrying so much about my possible heart problem; my anxiety gets worse. I have a return visit to the doctor on November 28th. It's a very busy office; so getting in sooner is basically out of the question.

122,122,Amlodipine+hypertension,I have a copy of my treadmill test results. My ST was flat at about 0.9 out to about 90 BPM (V3); then dropped with a near constant slope to -0.9 at about 120 BPM and then dropped with a steeper slope to -3.8 at 142 BPM. The recovery line followed the test line to about 120 BPM and then recoved with a smaller slope to about -.1 at 80 BPM after 11 minutes of recovery time. I did not experience any angina during the test. The angiogram showed three blockages; two in one branch artery at 90 and 75% and the second in another branch artery at 75%. The two blockages are in a branch off of the LAD. The other is in a branch off of the RCA. The 90% block is right at the junction of the branch. I tried to paste a picture showing the locations of the blockages; but would not work. The doctor put me on Amlodipine besylate and Metroprolol. The cardiologist said that my condition is not life threatening as long as I manage my lifestyle.. Can I infer a safe exercise level from the treadmill test results? I am 6' and 196 #. Up to the day of the treadmill I was exercising on a daily basis on the elliptical and rowing machine for 30-45 mintes with my heartrate at 125 to 130 BPM to lose weight and stay in shape. I am coming back from 4 months of sedentary life recovering from a detached retinal requiring multiple procedures to fix. The cardiologist has said that we will reassess the need and benefit for a stent in about 3 weeks with another treadmill and nuclear. I have improved my diet; but can I really expect an improvement in the treadmill results with diet and drugs in one month? The doctor suggested that if I had continued to exercise at the higher BPM; it would have eventually led to a heart attack; suggesting a strong correlation between ST depression and death. If the blockages are addressed with stents; does that mean that mean that my ST depression will be mitigated? If so; does that mean that I can get back to a more rigorous exercise regimen?

124,124,Amlodipine+hypertension,I had a liver transplant in 2000 after getting cirrhosis following hepatitis and ABVD chemotherapy and after failing interferon alpha therapy. Unfortunately the HCV was not eliminated and when I ran across an article that indicated that losartan(Cozaar) a blood pressure medicine may reduce or eliminate fibrosis I asked my doctor to change on of my blood pressure medicines to it which he did; coincidently on that visit he detected some fibrosis by feeling the stiffness of my liver. The hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated into myofibroblast-like cells that produce the fibrosis by angiotensin II. Losartan acts by blocking the angiotensin II receptor and costs 60.00 per month on Medicare; Vasotec cost about 5.00 per month. I was wondering if Enalapril(Vasotec) which is a angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor would have the same fibrosis reducing effect as losartan since stopping angiotensin II from being formed in the first place should work as well blocking the receptor where the angiotensin II docks at a cheaper cost. I found a positive answer in Chinese Medical Journal 2001 vol 114 No. 6 pages 583-7.

I also used to be very fatigued at times to a point where I could barely stand. Apart from this I have gastritis and heartburn though it has got better recently. I also suffered from unexpected weight loss. However currently my weight is more steady. I had all sorts of medical tests done on me. Only recently I was diagnosed with low vitamin D levels (less than 4.2) and low normal vitamin B12. I have stopped my medications for the past two months.

127,127,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 30 year old male I guess I'll start at the beginning from what I remember. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Osgood slaughter disease which started bad arthritis in my knees and made it difficult to play and play sports but I still did so. Throughout my childhood I always felt tired and sluggish with no energy or drive and had mild hypertension. I have always been slightly above average in size and weight but muscular. I also suffered stomach issues throughout my childhood lots of diarrhea and constipation never regular. In 2008 I had a rupture in my large intestine and was told by multiple doctors it was just gas until I went to erase and had a CT scan. Nearly a week had passed by then so I had extreme amounts of infection when they cut me open and had to remove a lot of small and large intestine that were bad and clean infection off of multiple organs. They diagnosed me with diverticulitis. I had so many antibiotics during this time. In 2012 i started having multiple high blood attacks where I would be taken to the error and have BP around 220 over 150. They started me on hydrochlorothiazide that didn't work so they added Benazepril and amlodipine that helped a little bit but then it worked it's way back up. Then we added Prozac and buspirone and (Xanax only as needed) we found that a lot of my blood pressure attacks were from anxiety. In 2014 I had severe pain in my feet and found out I had large heel spurs on both feet. In 2015 in march i had an ear ache to where my side of my head swelled and i had colliflower ear and i always had problems with antibiotics working so they started me off with augmentin that didn't work so they put me on ciprofloxacin which my doctor had to do often it was the only thing that worked for my infections ; so that was 3 weeks of antibiotics. I also end up with bad yeast infections everytime i take any antibiotics. In July I had another issue with my intestine and was diagnosed with crohns and was hospitalized for a few days with a bad crohns attack so they filled me up with antibiotics and my gastrointestinal doctor started me on prednisone which I took for a few months till around September. Had the worst withdrawal symptoms to where I had to crawl up steps took a while to ween off. A few weeks after I was off prednisone I started having bad lower back pains. My doctor gave me flexerill and that didn't work and the pain only got worse over the next few months. In January 2016 I was to where I could not work sleep or just sit without being in extreme pain. I had an mri done and I had 10 bulged disc and 5 of them herniated In my mid and lower back and multiple bone spurs and vertebrae worn down in size. I had my first 3 steroid epidural shots in February and that worked for a few weeks then never pain spread to more areas and pain has worsened I also have bone spurs in many other joints hips shoulders and fingers. The past few months it has just felt like something is eating my body inside of me I'm in extreme pain all over and it gets worse at night and take forever to get going in the morning or whenever I take a break. Pain meds don't work I cannot take nsaids or my stomach bleeds and we tried nerve pain pills but I'm allergic. I just feel like there is something causing all this that my doctors can't figure out my health is falling at a rapid pace I'm still working hard but the past few days it feels like my hips are falling out of place. I have been reading up on candida and wonder how to bring that up to my doctor.

In 5/09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell; suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to 100mg Aspirin. In 12/09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days.

How do we determine this? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?? What should be the proper treatment?

130,130,Amlodipine+hypertension,My mother (56+ yrs) is under treatment for Hypothyroidism; Hypertension; Osteoporosis along with Osteo Arthritis. For Hypertension; she had taken Olsar 40 from Feb; 2014 to Dec; 2014; after which our medicine doctor has changed it to Olmat 20 AM; which she has been taking since past 3-months; during which most of her BP readings (using mercury device) are either 120/80 or 130/80. However; 2-3 days back; she started feeling the surrounding very hot & uncomfortable with complete loss of appetite & thirst. Also; she felt to have indigestion & a little fever (99.5); which got normalized after a day after taking medicines like crocin & pundinhara. However; during these 2-3 days whenever we measured her BP (using Omron electronic monitor) most of her readings are around 125/80 with pulse between 80-85; which is quite higher than her usual electronic BP readings 110/70 & pulse 70-75. Also; since the mercury BP readings are usually 10-15 units higher than that of electronic readings; I am worried whether these 125/80 readings correspond to mercury readings higher than 140/90; which means her BP is not really under control. Can you please help us with the below mentioned queries - 1) Do you feel her discomfort was related to indigestion problem or; could it be related to higher BP or heart issues ? 2) She usually takes her BP medicine (Olmat 20 AM) around 9:30 in the morning. Usually her morning BP (before medicine) is 5-10 units higher than evening BP. Is this normal or; sign of any heart problem ? 3) Do you see any need for BP medicine change or more investigations here ? 4) If she encounters similar problems in future; what is most advisable to do ? 5) Just to note: her FBS was 103 in Dec; 2014 & 92 in Feb; 2015 after certain dietary changes; although PPBS was normal (90). Is this slightly higher tendency of FBS related to her situation ? 6) Couple of weeks back she had fever with cold/cough (URTI); after which she was given antibiotic by our medicine doctor & asked to stop her calcium medicine (Shelcal CT) for 10-days.

I have pain when I stand; walk; seat or lay down (this is e order of level of pain as well - standing is the worse). When I stand the bottom of my feet will throb. Sometimes most of the bottom and sometimes I will get certain points like the heel or by the big toe that almost feels like a cigarette burn. Other time like when I seat from inside e ankle to my whole foot will burn/tingle. It's almost like the pressure on the back of my leg causes this. Also; sometimes if you run your hand from the top of my leg to the ankle you can feel;it go from warm to very cld at the ankle. This has been gradually getting worse over the past 8 years and I have seen a ton of doctors. General doc; nuralagist; chiro; podiatrist; homeopathy; acupuncture; pulmutalagist;.

132,132,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Medical History: My Mom; age 71;lives in Singapore; has history of hypertension. She was hospitalized in 5/'09 for drug (Hypertension medication: methyldopa) induced Cholestasis prescribed by a new Dr. While hospitalized; she was diagnosed of Atrial Fibrillation (“2DE result: normal LV size & systolic function. No RWMA. LVEF 59%; Normal PASP 26mmHg. Trivial aortic & tricuspid regurigation.”) Aspirin (100 mg) was prescribed. ECG attached. Her hospital's ""Chest AP/sitting"" result: “The heart size can not be accurately assessed ... but appeared to be enlarged. There is mild prominence of the hilar vessels; suggestive of mild congestion.” She was recruited into a Warfarin vs Apixaban double blind clinical trial & started the treatment on Aug-4; 2009. We later found out that she is on Warfarin w/ dosage unknown to us. 14 days after the Wafarin treatment; she fell (cause of falling unknown; according to her friend who was walking right next to her that my Mom stopped walking forward & dropped on the floor) & hit back of her head. She was conscious & mobile initially. Repeated brain CT scan in the hospital the same day “due to drop in GCN”. The second CT scan shown a much larger bleed out due to blood thinning effect of Warfarin. She became semi-conscious & loss senses & control on her left side. CT Brain results: “1. Acute subarachnoid & subdural haemorrhages 2: Pneumocephalus; occipital bone fractures; left haemotympanum & blood products in the sphenoid sinus. 3. Haemorrhagic contusion in left occipital lobe & old lacunar infarct right lentiform nucleus.” -Her INR is 3.5 (due to Warfarin) Luckily; after extensive rehab; she was able to regain 90+% of her physical & mental abilities. She was discharged on 9/11. The Blood test on Sept 14 during her visit with her Cardiologist: - Haematology: all within range. “Platelet clumping noted” - Biochemistry: non fasting; all within range or non clinical significant On her follow up visit with the Neurologist; her legs were checked & the Neurologist indicated that she doe not have tendency to embolize. And the brain CT scan (done in Sept after discharged from hospital) shows blood clot in her brain is almost gone & she is unlikely to have Alzheimer. Her BP has been in the 110-120/80 ranges. She has 3 BP medications & one for stomach (1. Amlodipine Besilate 10 mg; 2. Lisinopril 20 mg;3. Atenolol 50 mg; and Omeprazole 20 mg for stomach) On 9/28; the Cardiologist resumes her with Warfarin (1 mg/day to start with) despite our request to leave the trial & switch to Aspirin. When we request an echocardiogram; here is the Dr.’s response: “ WE NEED TO DO A TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (A MILDLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE) TO DETECT CLOTS RELIABLY; WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE. HOWEVER; EVEN IF NO CLOT WAS SEEN; THE RISK FOR CLOT FORMATION IS STILL PRESENT. DOING AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM WILL NOT CHANGE MANAGEMENT.” With these; here are my questions: 1. Given the patient's near-death bleed out; how safe is it to continue with her blood-thinning therapy? We; as her family; favor to use aspirin therapy for her AF to mitigate her risk of thromboembolism; as opposed to continuing with Warfarin. But given her near death brain-bleed while using Warfarin; is it wise to use ANY blood thinners now; even low dose aspirin? 2. Should the patient have an echocardiogram to determine the nature and extent of the clotting she is/may be forming due to her AF? What type of echocardiogram? Transthoracic or transesophageal ? What test; if any; can 'see' into the upper chambers of our mother's heart to help us determine to what extent she is building up clots; and therefore help us in forming and evaluating her true risk

133,133,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I had a kidney stone (6.5 mm) removed via ureteroscopy/laser lithotripsy on 11/18/05 because it became lodged at the ureto-vesicular junction after 12 days of excruciating right flank pain (6-8 hrs. per day) as it passed all the way down the right ureter. The day after the surgery; I experienced a different pain in the RUQ of the abdomen extending under and into the rib cage; back; and right shoulder area. I had a contrast helical(spiral) CT scan done on 11/21/05; and everything was normal except for sclerotic lesions found on my 4th and 7th left ribs (opposite side of the pain); which were believed to be bone islands by the radiologist. I had a bone scan done on 12/6/05; which showed two ""hot spots"" on my 10th left rib; which I later found out via a complete skeletal survey and a second reading of the CT scan (as they were not found on the initial read) to be two small sclerotic lesions on the 10th left rib (in addition to two small sclerotic lesions on the 7th left rib; one sclerotic lesion on the 4th left rib; and one sclerotic lesion on the right distal femur). The nuclear medicine physician's report simply stated that the findings were ""suggestive of a benign process"". I had an abdominal ultrasound done on 12/21/05; and the liver; pancreas; and gall bladder were seen as normal; except that a gallstone was found (without ductal dilatation; w/o widening of gall bladder walls; etc. and thus; was adjudged not to be a potential source of my RUQ adominbal/right rib cage pain). As shown below; lab tests were done before surgery (on 11/17/05); on 12/5/05; on 12/19/05; and; finally; on 1/10/06. The reason for the gap between the last two tests was to allow time for the liver enzymes to normalize; as multiple physical exams; CT scan; and abdominal ultrasound seemed to rule out liver; pancreatic; gall bladder; or kidney cancer; and the source of the elevated liver enzymes was hypothesized to be medicine (which was discontinued on 11/25/05). A colonoscopy was done on 11/28/05; and an upper endoscopy was done on 1/4/06; both of which were perfectly normal. Further; the cystoscopy done in conjunction with the ureteroscopy on 11/17/05 seemed to rule out bladder cancer. My PSA level is about 0.8 (ref. range 0-4); and thus; seems to rule out prostate cancer (along with a DRE done by my urologist). My main problem is that I am still experiencing no diminution of my RUQ abdominal/right rib cage/right upper shoulder pain (after almost 2 months); and my liver enzymes became significantly elevated between 11/17/05 and 12/19/05; although they seem to have come down significantly between 12/19/05 and 1/10/06; as seen below (AST down from 53 to 32 (ref. range 3-50 U/L) (ALT down from 209 to 77 (ref. range 3/60 U/L). My principal QUESTION is; in light of the above facts; and the below lab results; can I definitively rule out liver cancer? In this connection; would a liver tumor too small to be detected by CT scan and ultrasound cause the AST and ALT levels to rise significantly from well within normal limits the day before the surgery to well outside of normal limits (at least with respect to the ALT)about a month later (i.e.; from 11/17/05 to 12/19/05); with a significant rise between 11/17/05 and 12/05/05? Would a liver tumor cause the AST and ALT levels to rise as they did in a one month period; and then fall (although the ALT is still mildly elevated) in the next one month period; when they were perfectly normal just prior to the first one month period? Would a liver tumor cause pain before a rise were seen in the AST and ALT levels? Would a liver tumor cause pain without being detectable via ultrasound and helical CT scan? Based on my below lab results; can you provide any explanation as to what may have caused my abnormal LFTs? What recommendations do you have regarding further lab tests; imaging studies; etc.? (BTW: The medications I was given post-surgery were Cipro (2 tablets per day for 6 days; oxycodone 3 5 mg tablets per day for 7 days; and phenazopyridine (2 200mg tablets per day for 3 days). After a severe hypertensive episode on 12/5/05 (180/112 blood pressure); I was prescribed and have been taking ever since; Amlodipine (Norvasc) (1 5 mg tablet per day) and Ramipril (Altace) (1 2.5 mg capsule per day). A CT-Angiogram was also performed on 12/8/05 to rule out renovascular hypertension as the cause of my blood pressure. The findings were normal.

134,134,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Hello everyone! A quick review of what I know so far. I am a 33 year old obese white male; smoker; with hypertension. I was recently diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy including left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. I am on metoprolol; amlodipine and 81mg aspirin. I take simvastatin for my high sensitivity c-reactive protein number (8.9). I was recently given nitrostat for chest pain. This past week; I was put on a 48 hour holter monitor to see; as my cardiologist put it; why I had so many skipped beats. What follows is the narrative: ""Monitoring started at 2:04 pm and continued for 47 hours 59 minutes. Average heart rate was 73 BPM. The minimum heart rate was 39 BPM at 3:38 AM. The maximum heart rate was 136 BPM occuring at 9:05 PM. Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 3 beats; of which; 3 were in single PVCs. Ventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of less than one VE per hour. The patients rhythm included 12hr 34 min 34 sec of bradycardia. The slowest single episode of bradycardia occurred at 3:38:19 AM D1; lasting 3 min 53 sec; with minimum heart rate of 39 BPM. The patient's rhythm included 2 hr 10 min 43 sec of tachycardia. The fastest single episode of tachycardia occurred at 9:04:02 PM D2 lasting 5 min 21 sec; with maximum heart rate of 136 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 1836 beats of which; 39 were in 5 runs; 12 were in atrial couplets; 1545 were single PACs; 7 were in bigeminy; 233 were in trigeminy. There were 2 dropped beats. The longest R-R interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest N-N interval was 2.3 seconds occurring at 6:00:46 AM D1. The longest supraventricular run occurred at 9:49:35 PM D! consisting of 26 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 138 BPM. The fastest supraventricular run occurred at 1:24:33 AM D1; consisting of 3 beats; with a maximum heart rate of 169 BPM. Supraventricular ectopic beats occurred at a rate of 38.2 SVEs per hour TECH COMMENTS: Sinus rhythm with episodes of 2nd degree AV block; rates of 39 to 136 BPM. Rare PVCs without VT. Occasional PACs with 5 atrial runs; the longest was 26 beats and the fastest was 169 BPM. No pauses seen. Patient reported symptoms of palpitations and chest pain; which correlated with sinus rhythm. My cardiologist wants to run a sleep study. Obviously the 2nd degree AV block is of the greatest concern. The nurses told me it was of the type 2 variety. My question is that I had a sleep study done 4 years ago and it was negative for sleep apnea. Is a new sleep study warranted at this time?",2010,2012,33,Male,,,[],"[33, 48, 4]",Hello everyone A quick review I know far I 33 year old obese white male smoker hypertension I recently diagnosed hypertensive cardiomyopathy including left ventricular hypertrophy left atrial enlargement I metoprolol amlodipine 81mg aspirin I take simvastatin high sensitivity c reactive protein number 8 9 I recently given nitrostat chest pain This past week I put 48 hour holter monitor see cardiologist put I many skipped beats What follows narrative Monitoring started 2 04 pm continued 47 hours 59 minutes Average heart rate 73 BPM The minimum heart rate 39 BPM 3 38 AM The maximum heart rate 136 BPM occuring 9 05 PM Ventricular ectopic activity consisted 3 beats 3 single PVCs Ventricular ectopic beats occurred rate less one VE per hour The patients rhythm included 12hr 34 min 34 sec bradycardia The slowest single episode bradycardia occurred 3 38 19 AM D1 lasting 3 min 53 sec minimum heart rate 39 BPM The patient rhythm included 2 hr 10 min 43 sec tachycardia The fastest single episode tachycardia occurred 9 04 02 PM D2 lasting 5 min 21 sec maximum heart rate 136 BPM Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted 1836 beats 39 5 runs 12 atrial couplets 1545 single PACs 7 bigeminy 233 trigeminy There 2 dropped beats The longest R R interval 2 3 seconds occurring 6 00 46 AM D1 The longest N N interval 2 3 seconds occurring 6 00 46 AM D1 The longest supraventricular run occurred 9 49 35 PM D consisting 26 beats maximum heart rate 138 BPM The fastest supraventricular run occurred 1 24 33 AM D1 consisting 3 beats maximum heart rate 169 BPM Supraventricular ectopic beats occurred rate 38 2 SVEs per hour TECH COMMENTS Sinus rhythm episodes 2nd degree AV block rates 39 136 BPM Rare PVCs without VT Occasional PACs 5 atrial runs longest 26 beats fastest 169 BPM No pauses seen Patient reported symptoms palpitations chest pain correlated sinus rhythm My cardiologist wants run sleep study Obviously 2nd degree AV block greatest concern The nurses told type 2 variety My question I sleep study done 4 years ago negative sleep apnea Is new sleep study warranted time,hello everyon A quick review I know far I 33 year old obes white male smoker hypertens I recent diagnos hypertens cardiomyopathi includ left ventricular hypertrophi left atrial enlarg I metoprolol amlodipin 81mg aspirin I take simvastatin high sensit c reactiv protein number 8 9 I recent given nitrostat chest pain thi past week I put 48 hour holter monitor see cardiologist put I mani skip beat what follow narr monitor start 2 04 pm continu 47 hour 59 minut averag heart rate 73 bpm the minimum heart rate 39 bpm 3 38 AM the maximum heart rate 136 bpm occur 9 05 PM ventricular ectop activ consist 3 beat 3 singl pvc ventricular ectop beat occur rate less one VE per hour the patient rhythm includ 12hr 34 min 34 sec bradycardia the slowest singl episod bradycardia occur 3 38 19 AM D1 last 3 min 53 sec minimum heart rate 39 bpm the patient rhythm includ 2 hr 10 min 43 sec tachycardia the fastest singl episod tachycardia occur 9 04 02 PM D2 last 5 min 21 sec maximum heart rate 136 bpm supraventricular ectop activ consist 1836 beat 39 5 run 12 atrial couplet 1545 singl pac 7 bigemini 233 trigemini there 2 drop beat the longest R R interv 2 3 second occur 6 00 46 AM D1 the longest N N interv 2 3 second occur 6 00 46 AM D1 the longest supraventricular run occur 9 49 35 PM D consist 26 beat maximum heart rate 138 bpm the fastest supraventricular run occur 1 24 33 AM D1 consist 3 beat maximum heart rate 169 bpm supraventricular ectop beat occur rate 38 2 sve per hour tech comment sinu rhythm episod 2nd degre AV block rate 39 136 bpm rare pvc without VT occasion pac 5 atrial run longest 26 beat fastest 169 bpm No paus seen patient report symptom palpit chest pain correl sinu rhythm My cardiologist want run sleep studi obvious 2nd degre AV block greatest concern the nurs told type 2 varieti My question I sleep studi done 4 year ago neg sleep apnea Is new sleep studi warrant time,3,5,0,"[""Pain"", ""APNOEA"", ""Pulsus trigeminus""]","[""Hypertension"", ""Cardiomyopathies"", ""Obesity"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy"", ""Premature ventricular contractions""]",[]
135,135,Amlodipine+hypertension,"My mom is a 72 year old female living in Singapore and diagnosed with hypertension 8 years ago; which was initially controlled via well-known BP medications (see below); but which medications she is no longer prescribed for unknown reasons. In 5/’09; while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis; she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/’09; 14 days into Warfarin therapy; she fell (cause unknown); suffering a skull fracture causing an acute subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage. She was initially paralyzed on her left side. She recovered almost 90% after 3 weeks. On our request; she was switched from Warfarin to Aspirin. In 12/’09; she had an open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones. In 5/’10 ; she had a minor stroke. Her eyesight became blurry; she vomited twice and lost motor control; especially on her left side. She was discharged from the hospital after 1 to 2 days. She is now back on Warfarin (with the same cardiologist who recruited her for the Apaxiban vs Warfarin clinical trial back in 8/’09.) For 2 to 3 months before the 5/'10 stroke; my mom had been suffering pain in her left shoulder; making it more difficult for her to sleep at night (she’s always had difficulty falling asleep). The new medications (Simvastatin &Warfarin) seem to lessen the shoulder pain. Sadly; she has been suffering slowly decreasing lucidity after the 8/’09 hospitalization; with etiology uncertain. She monitor her BP 3 times a day : Upon awaken before breakfast - around 140 In the afternoon & evening - around 120 She take her BP medicine after breakfast. ECG results: 4/’09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex 5/’09: AF; T abnormalities 8/’09: (hospitalized for CNS hemorrhages) Sinus rhythm 10/’09: AF; T & ST abnormalities Medications BEFORE 5/’10 stroke: 30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mg Lisinopril: 40 mg Atenolol: 50 mg Omeprazole: 40 mg Aspirin: 100 mg Medications AFTER 5/’10 stroke: Simvastatin 10mg Warfarin She has no other risk; CHADS is ""1"". 1. Her stroke symptoms indicate neuro problems. Shouldn’t a neurologist be her main Dr.? 2. Was her stroke most likely secondary to a blood clot (i.e.; blockage); or hemorrhaging due to capillary wall weakness secondary to either genetic propensity or vascular wall compromise due to long term hypertension? How do we determine this? What testing should be done? 3. Should she be on the statin drug rather than a regular; time-tested BP med (like her original BP meds listed above)?

136,136,Amlodipine+hypertension,I'm a 60-year old woman; weigh 105 lbs; exercise regularly. I take meds for hypertension and cholesterol and I also take synthroid. About 6 months ago I started a low carb diet for my overall health because heart disease is in my family. I cut out processed foods; bread; white potatoes; pasta; crackers; candy; cereal; desserts. My diet consists of salads with reduced fat dressings; salmon; chicken; tuna; occasional steak; green vegetables; occasional sweet potato; nuts; cottage cheese; greek yogurt and Atkins bars. I recently had a blood test and my fasting blood sugar went from 87 to 96; and my A1C rose from 5.8 to 5.9. I was shocked because my diet has not included simple carbs for the past 6 months. Can you give me some insight as to what may be driving up my fasting gluclose and A1C if I'm not eating high carb foods? I do not cheat on my diet and I exercise 3-4 days per week. I would be happy to adjust my diet again; but I'm at a loss as to what can be causing this.

146,146,Amlodipine+hypertension,"I have suffered from extremely frequent cluster migraines since I was in an ambulance accident in which we almost rolled over in 1993. I was in the back of the truck caring for a patient.....it was a code situation and my partner stopped at a light at an extremely hazardous intersection; all traffic stopped and he proceded with caution; but a car came out of nowhere at about 50mph; and hit us on the passenger side in the patient compartment where I was sitting; placing us up on two wheels; almost ejecting my partner out of the truck and sent me headfirst all over the back of the ambulance; I swore we rolled over. Our fuel line was ruptured; and I saw nothing but white.....my head was killing me; and I ached all over. Although I couldn't see my partner came around the back and helped me unload the patient who was still safely secured on the stretcher. I was boarded and collared and taken to the hospital. They found nothing remarkable and sent me home; after I regained my vision a short while later. My migraines have been escalating in severity over the years; and I've had various MRIs done; but usually they revealed little unless I was in an active migraine. In 2006 I had an MRI which showed; and I quote; ""Reversal of the normal cervical lordosis""; with left central and left paracentral soft disc herniation demonstrated with deformity upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and spinal cord at C5-6; and a C6-7 disc space narrowing present with disc herniation demonstrated and slight caudal extension of disc material is present; at C7-T1 there was no focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis shown. No matter what I've done; and trust me; I've had cervical epidurals; radiofrequency therapy and injections; intradisc injections; TEMS; botox injections; chiropractic work; physical therapy......nothing helps; and sometimes even aggravates the migraines that can last for days at a time. There is often an aura; but I mostly wake up with them now...... I am unable to take triptans due to my HTN; toradol; steroids such as predisone and decadron give me hives.....calcium channel blockers and antidepressants also have no effect; and anti-convulsants also have not worked. At this time I am on neurontin at 600mg bid; and it seems to help but I still get them when the weather is damp or rain is predicted...my head is my barometer. I've been on pain meds forever; and I'm at a loss at what to do. Pain management here is all about therapy; not medication; and I don't know what to do. I live in NJ; for the record.

147,147,Amlodipine+hypertension,My poor girl Zola has been lethargic and disinterested in her kibble off and on this month. Two nights ago I bought a bag of a different food to see if she would try it. I mixed it with some old food and she ate the whole bowl right away. That was around 6 pm. I work grave shift so I got home Saturday morning and took her out to potty. Her eyes were both covered by the lower eyelid membrane and she seemed disoriented; and confused. I helped her find her way back inside and tried to calm her down as she was trembling. When I checked her gums they were very pale. I've never seen this; so I rushed her off to the vet. She perked up some (she loves car rides) but had an accident there.VET diagnosed her with renal failure... Creatine was supposed to be 1.8 and hers is 8.1. The BUN number was supposed to be under 29 and she's at a 90. I'm terrified. She has blood in herurine and the protein Is high. Vet gave her an IV catheter and sent her home with me to return in the morning. At pickup She was prescribed Hills Prescription Diet k/d and some aluminum hydroxide gel to take with it to keep her phosphorous levels down. She hates the syringe of the gel; but ate the canned Hills with vigor so that was promising! She spent last night curled up on the couch with us. She enjoyed her new food again this morning and her stool was a better consistency. At 9:00 AM today Zola returned to the vet for more IV fluids as planned. They re ran bloodwork and also checked her electrolyte levels to see where her numbers were. She stayed at the vet all day receiving fluids. She threw up once and had a little diarrhea there. Her numbers haven't improved. She will return tomorrow for another round of fluids and tests. I am so worried and not ready to make any decisions. I know the vet is doing everything they can.

148,148,Amlodipine+hypertension,A recent paper studied the effect of most FDA approved drugs on the inhibition of NTCP; the now known entry receptor for HBV. Ezetimibe was found to have a 50%inhibition conc of 25micromolar; while irbesartan; a commonly used angiotensin inhibitor to reduce blood pressure; was found to inhibit at 11.9 micromolar. Both compounds have similar MW; but irbesartan is given at up to 300mg per day; while exetimibe is dosed at 10mg. Thus the combination of 30fold higher approved dose and the double micromolar inhibition potency makes; in theory; irbesartan 60 fold more potent to inhibit Hbv entry. Of course; binding of these drugs to plasma proteins could cause substsntial differences in the available concentration on the hepatocyte membrane receptor; and the pharmacokinetics could further influence the in vivo efficscy. Tests in chimeric mice are urgently needed to determine the in vivo efficacy of this common; mostly beneficial medication on HBV reinfection inhibition.,2011,2013,,Male,,,[],"[50, 25, 30]",A recent paper studied effect FDA approved drugs inhibition NTCP known entry receptor HBV Ezetimibe found 50 inhibition conc 25micromolar irbesartan commonly used angiotensin inhibitor reduce blood pressure found inhibit 11 9 micromolar Both compounds similar MW irbesartan given 300mg per day exetimibe dosed 10mg Thus combination 30fold higher approved dose double micromolar inhibition potency makes theory irbesartan 60 fold potent inhibit Hbv entry Of course binding drugs plasma proteins could cause substsntial differences available concentration hepatocyte membrane receptor pharmacokinetics could influence vivo efficscy Tests chimeric mice urgently needed determine vivo efficacy common mostly beneficial medication HBV reinfection inhibition,A recent paper studi effect fda approv drug inhibit ntcp known entri receptor hbv ezetimib found 50 inhibit conc 25micromolar irbesartan commonli use angiotensin inhibitor reduc blood pressur found inhibit 11 9 micromolar both compound similar MW irbesartan given 300mg per day exetimib dose 10mg thu combin 30fold higher approv dose doubl micromolar inhibit potenc make theori irbesartan 60 fold potent inhibit hbv entri Of cours bind drug plasma protein could caus substsntial differ avail concentr hepatocyt membran receptor pharmacokinet could influenc vivo efficsci test chimer mice urgent need determin vivo efficaci common mostli benefici medic hbv reinfect inhibit,0,1,1,[],"[""Cardiac Arrest""]","[""Mental blocking""]"
149,149,Amlodipine+hypertension,"Dear Doctor; I am writing to you seeking for some practical advice; and I hope you can help me. I have outlined the problems as detailed as I can; and have included all drug (brand names in parenthesis); in case of cross-country differences. *** Hypertension; Tachycardia: I am now 22 years old; and 2 years ago; during a regular medical check-up; the gynaecologist found that I had a resting blood pressure of 140/90. Was a regular blood donor for 3 years (and on holiday); so the BP-spike was an anomaly. She subsequently refered me a to physician-neurologist. An ABPM was done; and the highest reading of BP was 158/128. Tachycardia was another feature on the ABPM (with HR as high as 160; not-under-strenous-activity). Note: No feeling of anxiousness during the high heart rate. I have very minimal family history of HTN (parents have slightly elevated bp; after age 45); am active; have a BMI of 21; and borderline Cholesterol. Have been through the mill for ALL tests to check for secondary HTN; and the only abnormality is high (sitting upright for half an hour) renin at 17.0 (Range: 0.2-2.8); although Aldosterone was normal. Doppler U/S and Renal MRA showed no Renal Artery Stenosis. Am now on Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg; Valsartan (Diovan) 160 mg; Propranolol (Inderal) 80 mg; all once daily. Doctors are ambivalent about diagnosis: Some belief it is essential HTN; while some belief we just havent hit the nail on the head. *** Tremors: A few months after that; I developed severe tremors of my hands; and when fatigued; of the legs as well; to the extent I cannot walk. I cannot write properly unless with medication (I am on Propranolol; 80 mg; once daily) as my hands will tremble and I have to grip my pen tightly in order to maintain penmanship; as my hands also feel weak (only confined to fine motor movement like writing; using a tweezer etc). My eyelids and lips also occasionally tremble (thyroid function normal). There are also occasions every day when individual appendages and digits twitch for no reason (kinda like a sudden jerk?). *** Problems emptying bladder: 3 months ago; I started having problems with my bladder; where I had to visit the bathroom a few times before I 'finished'. I also have problem initiating urine flow despite the bladder feeling heavy; and have perisistent dribbling at the end. The bladder problem became troublesome when I kept waking up at night. I initially thought I was having a urinary tract infection; but urinalysis showed no bacteria. Two pre+post-micturition Ultrasounds were done; the first showed incomplete emptying (bladder at that time was very full); while the second (a bladder which was quite empty) showed complete emptying. Note: Blood/Urine sugar consistently normal. I also realise that at the peak of my urinary activity (when I keep going to the toilet every half an hour); I have a lot of saliva pooling in my mouth; at the bottom (the rest of my mouth feels very dry); and I have to consciously remind myself to swallow. *** Haywire Blood Pressure; when ill: A month ago; I was admitted for an acute nasopharyngitis+otitis media+severe migraine. During hospitalisation; I was given Oxymethazoline Hydrochloride (Afrin) to clear the nasal congestion and IV-Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). Early the next morning; my BP dropped to a surprising 70/40 (without anti-Hypertensives). I was not purging; or vomiting; and had maintained normal fluid intake. The BP stubbornly refused to climb despite the administration of IV-fluids; and I remained in hospital for 4 days. (Note: Doctor ordered me to off all anti-Hypertensives; and one week later; my BP went up to (the highest) 177/135)) *** Pupillary Reflex: Upon discharge; I collapsed at home; which the doctor diagnosed as vasovagal. Upon examination; she found that my pupils were strangely more dilated than normal (to penlight and accommodation); in absence of pain. I was refered to a Opthalmologist; who found no problems; using his ""super torchlight"" (he didn't use a penlgiht). The first doctor thinks there is still cause for concern; because my pupils used to constrict properly (to penlight and accommodation); and she has been my physician for the past 3 years. For a few years; I have had a problem focusing when I read (if for a long time) books/articles/passages etc wtih small print. I find that my central vision will suddenly disappear (peripheral vision is intact); and I have problems when reading from line to line (like the vision jumps). My prescription lens power has been checked yearly and they have remained at the same level. Is it possibly caused by accommodation problems? *** Differential Diagnosis: My physician has put a few things into the basket of possible differential diagnosis; and I am wiritng to you to ask if you have encountered anything even remotely similar to my case. Among the condition my physician suspects (subject to further discussion) are: 1) Idiopathic Pandysautonomia 2) Idiopathic Dysautonomia 3) (Purely Autonomic) CIDP My physician admits she isn't very familiar with these conditions as she has yet to see a full-blown case in practise. .. She suspects my immune system is always active. I have been 'plagued' with recurrent acute tonsilitis for years (leading to the eventual removal after going into a near-Quinsy emergency in 2006) and now without my tonsils I get other infections of the upper respiratory tract; have also had recurrent allergies which attack my eyes; ears; nose; skin since young. She thinks it is worthwhile doing an LP to check for oligoclonal bands. One note of interest: I had measles at the age of 9 months (to which the pediatrician said I did not need the MMR vaccination; since I had measles); mumps at 14 years old; and received my Rubella-vaccination at the age of (I think) 15. I read somewhere that the measles virus can remain dormant in the body for years and come back and wreck havoc years later. Is that true? *** Pressing Question: 1) Is there a reason for us to continue looking for an answer to my problems; and if yes; are we along the right path? I don't believe I am stressed out with life and neither does my physician or family; but is stress a possible factor in all the above symptoms? I am open to the possibility =) *** I know this letter is very long; and I thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you.

151,151,Amlodipine+hypertension,I am 25 years old and very healthy. I am not overweight; I work out regularly; eat healthy; don't smoke. For the past 3 months I have been having severe swelling in my left foot and ankle. At times the swelling continues into my calf and causes a discomfort. I first noticed the swelling after I got home from the gym one evening. I took my shoe off and my foot was huge for no reason. I have not had any injuries; insect bites or infections. The first doctor I went to took x-rays which came back normal and ran a CBC which also came back completely normal. He told me I would just have to live with the swelling and wrote a Rx for Lasik PRN to help. The Lasik does help when I take it but as soon as I stop taking it the swelling comes right back. I've been told not to take it long term as it can effect important vitamin levels. I wasn't ready to just treat the symptoms and live with it so I went to an Internist who took me off birth control pills thinking it could be hormones but the swelling continued. She then sent me for a venous doppler test which also came back normal. She is sending me for an untrasound of the heart tomorrow. If the heart tests come back normal what else could be causing this unexplained swelling? It is only in the left foot/ankle and pitts for about 30 seconds when pushed on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with a diasnosis? I am afraid that I'm at the end of the road with tests and the doctors can't seem to figure out what is causing this swelling in a young; healthy person.

152,152,Amlodipine+hypertension,Hi; I am a 27 year old healthy male. I work as a physical education teacher and consider myself to be relatively healthy. I had my first episode of atrial fibrillation at the end of May. I had to be cardioverted to restore it to normal. Then about 3 months later at the end of August I had another episode of atrial fibrillation and had to be cardioverted again. It is the middle of November now; and I had to be cardioverted again yesterday for the 3rd time. My symptoms were all different all 3 times. The first time I had only leg pain; 2nd time I went flush and palpiations and a racing heart; and the third time I had mild palpitations. My holters (2) of them were normal; my echocardiogram was normal..no alcohol or drug abuse.I dont drink caffine..I just dont get it..any one else in the same boat?

155,155,Amlodipine+hypertension,For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches.

159,159,Amlodipine+hypertension,For the past 4 years I have been experiencing horrible symptoms. It seemed that the whole thing started as a sinus infection but then I went for a CT scan of sinuses and they were clear. I have been having symptoms of dizziness; head pain; shakiness and a spaced out kind of foggy feeling like i am watching my life from the outside - all day every day. There are some times for a couple of hours during the day that the symptoms may lift and give me a few moments to live- but not much. I have been to about 30 doctors- including ENT's allergists; neurologists; chiropracters; opthamologists. psychologists; dentists and everything else u can think of. All CT scans; MRI of brain and blood work keep coming back clean and ok. Nothing I try seems to work. There was a period of time about 3 and a half years ago that the symptoms lifted for about 4 months and then it returned full force. Some of the weird parts are that the shakiness seems to be seasonal - coming in spring and lasting thru summer and its miserable like a tingling pins and needles sensation thru out my body. I have also been getting what some doctors seem to diagnose as recurring sinus infections- like 10 a year- i take anti biotics and i feel slightly better until the next infection but i still have the other symtoms while I am on the medication. I have hay fever and allergies to mold dust...Every doctor tried diagnosing something different- like migraines or TMJ or some sort of other odd thing. I've tried tons of medications. I dont usually have all the symptoms at once...they kind of take turns. One doctor suggested moving to Arizona as it may be a sinus issue but the ENT's say I have no sinus isue- just regular allergies and the allergists say that they have never seen symptoms like these for allergies. I tried psychologists even though the ony reason I am stressed out is cuz I can never live....before this sickness I was the happiest person around- and even psychologists turned me away as normal.

163,163,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a male 70 years of age. I have been on 150mg Irbesartan and 5mg Amlodipine daily since October 2010. This controlled by BP within acceptable limits.

164,164,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 33 year old female (mother of 3 year old twins) and am very worried about my recent echo results. I started having palpitations a few years ago and random chest pain every once in a while....enough to worry me. So i started seeing a cardiologist a couple yrs ago and every since the beginning he has seemed to minimize symptoms and test results. Ive wore a Holter monitor twice and he stated i had some tachycardia but otherwise seemed normal. My echo one year ago showed i have mild mitral valve prolapse and a borlerline leaky valve...but otherwise he stated my echo looked normal and strong. Well i went for another echo about a month ago and it shows my mild mitral valve prolapse (as expected) but he also said he was surprised to find mild pulmonary hypertension. He once again totally blew it off and said it was nothing to worry about since i wasn't having symptoms and said to schedule for 6 months. He stated sometimes thesenfinding with echos are wrong and he felt it was nothing to be concerned about Feeling uneasy about these finding i requested my 2 echo reports and compared them and the year old echo showed 35 for my pressure and now one yr later shows 40! Why isnt that concerning to him??? I scheduled an appt with a pulmonary doctor for next wk but am worried sick over this. I am 5'7 and weigh 120lbs...have regular lower BP otherwise and am healthy otherwise. A couple months ago i wss having shortness of breath and felt like i had congestion in my chest and even went to my family doctor for it but she said my lungs sounded clear.

168,168,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hello all. Background info- 39 yr old female. So a couple months ago I went to a wellness clinic at work and my bp read at 200/106. I had no symptoms; they begged me to see a dr asap and so I went to the ER that night. My bp was 213/109 at that point and for whatever reason the doctor that evening initially said there wasn't really anything to be done as I had no real ""symptoms"" even though the attending nurses kept emphasizing it was the ""silent killer"". Eventually someone came in and randomly put meds in my IV without saying a word. My bp came down only to shoot right back up moments later. They gave me a prescription for labetalol and said to fill it immediately and see my PCP asap. A few days later I saw my doctor; my bp was still really high even on the meds. She switched me to 100mg ER Metoprolol to take in the morning and 20mg lisinopril for the night. I had to take my bp every day and went back every week. Every week it would be high at the dr Office and she would increase the lisinopril. Mind you; I didn't take prescription anything prior to this except maybe an antibiotic when needed. Now I'm on these high doses of bp meds. Initially I thought well I'll get used to them; there's always an adjustment time. Almost two months in and I can barely function. I'm on intermittent FMLA because I have to keep missing work. I feel separated from my body at times; I have visual disturbances; sometimes my bp plummets way down; and most of the time I'm just lying on the couch crying; frustrated about my inability to do anything. I used to work out five days a week; now I've gained 10 lbs in two months. I'm not suicidal but plenty of times I've thought it would be easier to have just stayed off the meds and ignored the bp and just let nature run its course. So FINALLY this week she decided we should stop the lisinopril at least and see if my bp stays down. BUT she suggested adding Prozac. All my tests and blood work have been clear amazingly enough so there doesn't appear to be a real health issue. She now believes it was triggered by anxiety. She is giving me a week to read about Prozac and consider it. She did tell me there were side effects but said its ""gentle"". I am so SO terrified to add something like that esp with how low I've been feeling lately. I know from what I've read the first few weeks can be awful. My mom took Prozac in the 80s for major depression. It was terrible. She didn't get out of bed for a year really and I should mention; she was taking diltiazem at the time. I am at a loss for what to do. The side effects of Prozac seem like they would enhance the side effects that I am having from metoprolol. Have any of you taken this combination or similar and ultimately did you feel it was worth it? I just know I can't continue on like I am feeling now.

170,170,Diltiazem+hypertension,In the last two weeks I have had four episodes of AFIB. The first in two years landed me in the Hospital. My meds were changed from Metoprolol to Diltiazem 360 mg per day and Fleconade 50 mg 2x per day plus Warfarin. The Metoprolol 25mcg 1 x daily has been making me wheeze for the past four years; but no one ever thought to change the meds. I have been on this new med protocol for 1.5 weeks. I just started the Fleconide and Warfarin three days ago. My question is I need to loose 45 pounds asap. I am doing very well eating 1000 Kcal per day with a small abount or carbs (under 25) and otherwise lots of green vegetables and fish (Salmon only once a week) ; then some extra lean turkey. Really feel great with the diet. But I started moderate exercise as soon as I was released from the Hospital. I walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.5mph then I do various lite weight lifting (Nautilus rocker equipment) I have lost 10 lbs since my Hospital visit. But i have also had three episodes of AFIB while the Diltiazem was being increased. EchoCardiogram and Chemical Stress test shows zero blockages or other heart problems. I have the approval of the Cardiologist to go back to the gym and moderately exercise. I have quickly become addicted to the exercise and the diet.

179,179,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Thank you for taking my question on above subject. Would so appreciate advice. Given 2 diagnoses on visit to PH Clinic: #Exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. #Systemic hypertension. 'Inadaquately controlled needing more agressive treatment;'as printed on report.

There was an exc-induced increase in tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity; 2.6 to 3.7m/s (RV S-pressure: 32mmHg to 60; assuming RA pressure of 5mmHg). Still don't understand what above means in relation to 2 previous Echos (posted 01/30). Also wonder why PH Clinic didn't do a RHC to be sure; mostly was reason we traveled so far. May the reason have been my blood pressure was high; or fact that I had adverse reactions to Versed/Demarol after a TEE attempt; this year; locally? PH Clinc increased my 120mg diltiazem to 240mg daily; with suggestion of increase to 360 mg; and advised me 'PH does not appear to be a feature of my symptoms or current situation'.

180,180,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I am currently 32 weeks pregnant and am taking Cartia XT 240mg for pulmonary hypertension; aspirin and Lovenox due to antiphospholipid antibodes; prilosec; and 30mg of Cortef daily for adrenal insufficiency; which is slightly higher than replacement dose to simultaneously treat my autoimmune disease. Also; prior to the pregnancy I was taking 200mg of plaquenil twice daily; as well as 1200mg of Ibuprofen; for undifferentiated connective tissue disease. I will likely have to restart plaquenil and ibuprofen after the pregnancy if my autoimmune disease flares; which is likely. I was wondering about taking this combination of medications while breastfeeding. The Lovenox will be dropped; but all of the others will continue. There seems to be conflicting data about the safely of taking calcium channel blockers while breastfeeding; in particular. Many sites warn against taking Cartia XT sustained release capsules while breastfeeding; based on the results of certain studies that show a substantial amount passes through to the breastmilk; yet some experts seem to think it's okay. What would you recommend to a patient like me. I really don't want to continue to continue to expose the baby to multiple medications; especially the diltiazem; if not necessary.

181,181,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 61-year-old female; on treatment for hypertension and high cholesterol; 152 lb; strong family history of ischaemic heart disease. Chest pain last summer and autumn; when BP was 200/110 and 180/106 respectively. went away when my BP was controlled. I have a heart murmur which they have never been able to identify; but an echocardiogram revealed slight left ventricular hypertrophy. In April my thallium scan was negative. I do have indigestion problems; but the pain is totally different in nature and location. However; for the last two weeks I've been getting chest pain again: central strong pressure radiates to neck/jaw quite strongly precipitated by exercise or intense concentration usually goes off in 5 minutes relieved by GTN On Wednesday I had my most severe episode ever; triggered by hurrying for a bus. It lasted over 20 minutes (the neck pain longer) and taking 3 doses of GTN to settle. That was really scary. I’ve certainly never experienced anything like that before; although I can’t define it. Just occasional mini-episodes when I climb the stairs too fast now; but feeling totally shattered. Medication: Lisinopril 10mg Diltiazem XL 120mg Aspirin 75mg GTN spray Trazodone 150mg ) depression Fluanxol 1mg ) I eat a healthy diet; am losing weight and have recently started at the gym. My GP says this is OK ‘If I am sensible.’ On Tuesday I really overdid things; and after Wednesday’s scare; plus the fact that I feel so shattered; I’m having a break. Am I being neurotic in thinking that my scan was a false negative and that I do have ischaemic heart disease. Could indigestion radiate into my neck and be relieved by GTN? Could it be a non-ischaemic cardiac cause? My GP is going to refer me for an angiogram if it doesn't settle with diltiazem. She feels it could well be cardiac in spite of the tests.

183,183,Diltiazem+hypertension,Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.,2007,2012,65,Female,,,"['168/110', '130/84', '145/95', '130/80', '166/100', '170/108', '163/93']",[],Both parents number close relatives varying degrees hypertension I started chest pain 2006 BP found 168 110 It responded quite well treatment I sent investigation I echocardiogram showed definite although slight left ventricular hypertrophy felt I must hypertensive time I exercise ECGs radionuclide scan The result showed slight narrowing LAD considered insignificant pain disappeared My BP remained 130 84 145 95 I lisinopril increased 20mg diltiazem 120mg In 2011 I diagnosed type 2 diabetes I eat healthy diet although overweight losing well controlled Metformin However family history mean BP consistently 130 80 June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started develop similar central chest pain similar 2006 although radiating worse exertion sometimes present rest My GP would like investigations The last two days I resumed home BP monitoring seems consistently 166 100 Tonight pain severe enough require GTN rare This relieved instantly would point angina I took evening medication Before GTN BP 170 108 higher five years although I consistent medication Now still 163 93 I think I need medication increased long term,both parent number close rel vari degre hypertens I start chest pain 2006 BP found 168 110 It respond quit well treatment I sent investig I echocardiogram show definit although slight left ventricular hypertrophi felt I must hypertens time I exercis ecg radionuclid scan the result show slight narrow lad consid insignific pain disappear My BP remain 130 84 145 95 I lisinopril increas 20mg diltiazem 120mg In 2011 I diagnos type 2 diabet I eat healthi diet although overweight lose well control metformin howev famili histori mean BP consist 130 80 june 2012 I start propranolol 40mg twice daili A month ago I start develop similar central chest pain similar 2006 although radiat wors exert sometim present rest My GP would like investig the last two day I resum home BP monitor seem consist 166 100 tonight pain sever enough requir gtn rare thi reliev instantli would point angina I took even medic befor gtn BP 170 108 higher five year although I consist medic now still 163 93 I think I need medic increas long term,2,3,0,"[""Pain"", ""Angina Pectoris""]","[""Hypertension"", ""Diabetes"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy""]",[]

186,186,Diltiazem+hypertension,I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good.

The stress showed some ischemia and hence the cardiac cath but that was normal.

200,200,Diltiazem+hypertension,Since the beginning of January I; have been intermittently tachycardic (HR 95-120; generally 2-3 times a day); hypertensive (running anywhere from 170/110-220/140); nauseated; flushing (dry flushing; lasting anywhere from several minutes to 24 hours; present on face; neck; chest; and arms); and intermittent low grade temperatures (99.0-100.5). Initially was thought to have influenza; but no swab done. Then ?bacterial infection; course of antibiotics with no improvement. Continuing symptoms with no change. Visited ER multiple times and received IV fluids; which did not improve tachycardia or hypertension as it generally does with dehydration. Sepsis workup was negative; CT scan chest negative as well as chest x-ray. CT abdomen/pelvis did reveal a focal lesion on the liver; and small nonspecific inguinal lymph nodes. Follow-up MRI finding was focal fat left hepatic lobe. Normal appearing adrenal glands and pancreas. Prior to January I never had any history of hypertension or flushing. Flashback to Feb 2010... I had a mediastinal mass resection that pathology came back as benign thymic tissue. Had experienced tachycardia 4 months prior to resection and was hospitalized; sinus tachycardia 130's and ended up on diltiazem drip (avoided beta blockers due to asthma history). No mass on CT at that time! Had not experienced any further tachycardia since that then. July 2010 left thyroid nodule discovered on US and FNA completed...indeterminate; too few cells. This was followed by 2 ultrasounds 6 months apart with no change. It was decided at that point that no further follow-up was needed. This was at Mayo… Back to present...Echocardiogram completed the end of January was normal. We did end up starting diltiazem CD 180 mg with absolutely no improvement in tachycardia or hypertension. Spironolactone initiated 50 mg twice daily; minimal improvement. Performed 24 hour urine for metanephrine/catecholamine...negative; I don't have the specific values from this. Also performed 5-HIAA at that time; which was negative. Phone consult with endocrinology by my primary MD came up with ?carcinoid. Chromagranin-A was negative as well as tryptase. Dexamethasone suppression test completed 3 times; slightly elevated (2.4; should be =0); Prolactin 1.3 (5.2-26.5); Calcitonin <5.0 (<8). May 2; I had surgery. When I woke up in recovery it was like someone flipped a switch. No nausea and no flushing at all!!!! Blood pressures and heart rate still elevated. Also had horrendous pain at the incision site that we could not get controlled. Once we got home; I continued to have really bad pain for a couple weeks (cheeks would flush with pain only; and stop once improved). Blood pressures and heart rate began venturing back down to 140/80-160/100 (not good; but definitely a major improvement from prior to surgery). Continued to not have any nausea or flushing. Pathology came back as benign adenoma. I continued to be the one in a million patient and ended up with an infection in my incision; an allergic reaction to mederma; and a myositis in the muscles on the RIGHT side of my neck…but still no flushing; nausea; tachycardia; etc. My body had every reason to have those symptoms; but didn’t! 3 weeks later all of my symptoms came back with a vengeance..blood pressures; heart rate; flushing; nausea; palpitations…EVERYTHING!! At that point; meds were the same dosages. Blood pressures much more resistant to medications this time. Have had to titrate meds up a lot. Diltiazem stopped; labetolol started (200 mg twice daily). Had to decrease it due to near syncopal episodes; but interestingly enough; I never had a low blood pressure even with spells. Currently on Labetolol 100 mg twice daily; Clonidine 0.2 mg three times daily; Spironolactone 25 mg twice daily; and Lasix 20 mg daily. Even with this regimen am very routinely running blood pressures 170/100-210/130! Heart rates finally 80-95. Other symptoms basically the same. TSH was 1.65 in Jan; 0.8 in June; and 1.77 last week (reference range 0.36-3.74); FT4 0.79 (0.76-1.46) and T3 130 (80-200) last week. So; here is where things sit as of today. My gut feeling is that this is thyroid; even though labs are normal and have been the entire time. It seems really strange that after surgery; for a full 3 weeks; all symptoms were improved. Then; at the 3-4 week mark when you can start to figure out if the remaining thyroid will take over full function; symptoms came back. We already know that there are cysts on the remaining right lobe. It is also interesting that I was nauseated and had no appetite prior to surgery and gradually lost some weight over 5 months. In the immediate 1 month post-op period; I lost 15 pounds without trying; and eating high calorie; high protein; small meals. I asked the surgeon if we should have removed the entire thyroid. He can see where I'm coming from and can see the reasoning behind it. He told me he can see a huge difference from before surgery; to after; and to now! Also is willing to take the other half out; but endocrinology is adamant that this will not help flushing and hypertension issues. They also can't explain why symptoms went away or why they came back…or what they were from in the first place. Next Wednesday I have a consult with the surgeon that trained my surgeon. If he has seen anything like this or can see my rationale; he will give the go ahead for surgery. I'm at my wits end and just want to feel better and have my life back. I feel like my surgeon is the only one pulling for me aside from my primary doc. My gut is that this has to be done to prove one way or another. I have sat down with my main endocrinologist and had a consult with another. In very clear terms I explained what I think is going on. I told them that they have to take a step back from their numbers and doctor hat. They have to be able to look at things from the patient perspective. Ultimately this is my body and that counts for something. I'm the one living this miserable; scary reality. The really frustrating thing is that my primary doc; who is wonderful; doesn't even know what to do for meds for BP anymore. He asks what endocrinology think; who in return; don't really seem to be concerned with the situation or finding a fix. I'm stuck in the middle and just want to feel better. I do have a cardiology consult in August; but truly think that if we take the other half of the thyroid out that we won't need it. Does my thinking make sense to anyone else?

He is going to try a drug effective in maintaining sinus rhythm; Electrical cardioversion and consider Ablation procedure but he has already told me that these procedures may not work because I have been in permanent atrial fibrillation to long.

203,203,Diltiazem+hypertension,Last year my untreated BP was 200/110; but it is now between 108/65-134/85 most of the time. However; yesterday I was under a lot of stress at work and started to get similar chest pain to that which I do on exertion - central pressure going up into my neck; which continued mildly for 30 minutes . My BP was 157/100. In the end I used my GTN spray; which cleared the pain. This morning at work it was 153/93; going down to 134/84 after lunch. I have mild chest discomfort again at present under work pressure; and my BP is 138/91. Do I need to worry if it is spiking like this and causing pain under stress; or is it just something I have to live with? I know the levels on which hypertension is based are resting levels and my working levels are not resting. If my meds are adjusted more then it may drop lower at the more relaxed times.

206,206,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm an athletic otherwise healthy 63 yo female with around 30-40;000 PVCs/day- prob lifelong at decreased frequency- that were asymptomatic until July when pre-syncope & syncope began upon recovery from exercise; which progressed to shortness of breath; tachycardia; & occasional chest pain. After 2 ep studies w RVOT RF ablation then LVOT venous cryoablation; it was determined that I have an ectopic epicardial focus sitting right on the LAD off an oblique terminal cardiac vein (mapped with the rf probe) that is too big for the cryo probe & too dangerous to ablate with heat. They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced. High dose flecainide with diltiazem is effective but the flecainide causes visual symptoms; dizziness & fatigue that render me nonfunctional. Mexiletine w dilt is ineffective; metoprolol doesn't work w my bradycardia; & now they are increasing the rythmol & continuing cardizem but I'm still in bigeminy & highly symptomatic when my pulse gets down on the 20's & 30's from the pvcs. Stress echo shows great exercise tolerance & other than mild asymmetric lvh (no hypertension history) & ST depression of 2mm (told that's nl in women) & frequent recovery pvcs is pretty normal. EKG is pretty normal except for lvh by voltage criteria & the pvcs & nonspecific st-t changes. Can anyone think of anything else to try? I am not an anxious person nor do I have any drugs or alcohol to quit. The only time I feel okay is when my sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated- exercise; emotion; etc. but when that wears off; I get unable to drive or walk around as my brain does not seem to get enough oxygen with the low heart rate from pvcs.

208,208,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I had a cath preformed in Oct and had a spasm in one of the arteries while having the procedure done.I'm scheduled to go back in mid-Dec to discuss the medications I'm taking for blood pressure and possibly stopping some of them (metoprolol; diltiazem;minoxidil;traim/hctz;diovan and clonidin and wel chol)blood pressure is currently running in the(140's/70-80's)cholesterol;(done on 10/23) tri-365 tot-321 LDL-195 HDL-53 chol/HDLC-6.06 unable to take statins. Quetions: Are spasms somthing I should be concerned about; what causes them; a little info please? In the process of having the spasm;for which I did feel; the heart monitor showed a really weird rhythm to it;should I be concerned? Which calcium channel blockers work best and will I require life long treatment for this condition? What other treatment options are available other than calcium channel blockers;what adverse effects come from long term use of calcium channel blockers? How do you decide which medication to stop first when dealing with blood pressure that won't cooperate? If required to continue on all of the above medications;What kind of long term problems should I expect to have from all of them? What long term effects could I expect if I chose to not take anything at all?

209,209,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi. I am thirty years old and have been an asthmatic since childhood. I have been doing fine after several treatments during puberty; although I always carry a Ventilan pump and use it eventually. I have noticed that I can pass long periods of time without inhalating Ventilan; but sometimes I use it when feeling a very slight (perhaps psychological) broncho-constriction. When this happens I feel I need Ventilan more and more and tree-four days after the first episode I am using it a lot. Then I must make a mental effort not to use it and one; two days after I'm OK. This suggests to me that an addiction phenomena may be involved; and would like to have your opinion.

211,211,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello everyone. Just happened to come across this site when searching for more information on PVCs and Mitral Valve Prolapse. Wanted to share my story as well. Thursday night after Thanksgiving dinner; I started noticed PVCs about every couple of minutes or so. I didn't think much of it since I'd just ate a big dinner and thought it might be indigestion. Then Friday rolls around; and still feeling the PVCs every few minutes. Saturday night I decided to visit the ER since I've never had this happen before. Usually I feel them a few times a day at most. The doctor ran some tests; did a chest xray; and hooked me up to an EKG. After about 8 hours; they said the xrays and heart enzyme tests looked fine and no stress seemed present for my heart. The PVCs were very clear on the EKG to them; so they recommended that I contact my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist for follow up. Naturally; I was freaked out completely; but I do take some comfort in reading the posts on this site and seeing that there are others like me that share similar symptoms of PVCs lasting all day (and far beyond). Since this is a new journey for me; are there any questions I should have ready for the cardiologist? Any tests I should ask for?

213,213,Diltiazem+hypertension,"35 yo M; previously in good health. Cholesterol OK (170s) and bp 120s/70s. My father and his mother developed high bp in late 50s. No other history of heart trouble. I've recently developed heart rhythm probs. For last 2 months; I've had episodes when my HR races upon mild exertion. 1st visit to cardiologist occurred the same day as I was having symptoms. The EKG in office was normal. But a stress test showed HR quickly at 200. The doctor diagnosed SVT/atrial flutter and put me on 50mg Troprol and 325mg aspirin. I've had progressively longer episodes during which HR might race. During these; my resting HR is 90s and upon mild exertion HR rises to 180s. Sitting down or just standing still causes the HR to fall back to resting rate. High HR lasts only for a short time. The alternative “mode” for heart is normal. The resting HR is 65-75. During extended moderate exertion; HR rises to 110s. Further visits to the cardiologist occurred during this mode and my EKGs were normal. I had catheter ablation last week. Doctor found three irregular rhythms:1 main & 2 extra. The rhythms switched irregularly between the three. The two extra rhythms were short-lived and came from the left atrium. Despite this; main rhythm was treated but other 2 were not (too short lived). Two days after procedure; heart switched over to the ""fast"" mode and it has been there since then. Doc wants to wait and see what happens. While this is somewhat unsatisfactory; I understand the need to get a better handle on how often my symptoms occur; their nature; whether medication might help. 1)Is the Toprol worthwhile? I don't feel it is making much difference. 2)My doctor described my condition as unusual for someone of my age. How unusual? 3)What are the major risks?

214,214,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi doctor; I'm writing from Argentina; I find your advice and the forum to be extremely helpful. My case is that I've been taking Corgard (nadolol) in the range of 40-80mg for over 10 years to counter for IST; PVCs and mild/moderate hypertension. The med was a lifesaver for me and did manage to lower my heart rate to a range where I could feel confident. I also received treatmente for anxiety; clonazepam and an SSRI. Now in my country Bristol has discontinued the Corgard and there is no generic nadolol here so I've been switched to bisoprolol. This drug does not seem to be working; in fact my resting heart rate is going up to 90-100 in the evening and then I'm afraid of having an attack. I did resort to clonazepam for anxiety but had a couple of racing heart episodes during these days. I ended up secluded and terrified! I was wondering if the bisoprolol could be lowering my BP too much to a point where it could trigger reflex tachy or something (I'm on 5mg). Also; I wanted to ask you if there is any other betablocker which is more similar to nadolol; that is to say; which is more 'focused' on heart rate lowering (metoprolol; sotalol?). Finally; is adding ivabradine a possibility here? Because that would bring my sinus rate down without further lowering the BP. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. I feel quite frightened that this whole thing is coming back and the only thing at my disposal to stop it is gone. I had previously tried atenolol without good results. I have an appointment with my doc in a few days; but it'd put my mind at ease to have some reassurance as the day-by-day struggle to stay well continues.

They also found sinus node dysfunction & an ectopic atrial focus (the suspected source of tachycardia.) No VT was induced.

218,218,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 53 yo man diagnosed ~8 years ago with lone paroxysmal atrial flutter and afib. Long term history of endurance sports but nothing outrageous - running 20 miles a week since my teens. Episodes are generally less than an hour; but frequent - typically one every day or couple of days. Have been trying a ""pill in a pocket"" appproach - that is; I will take some metoprolol (50 mg tablet) if the tachycardia lasts more than 5 minutes. Usually the episode will end 10-20 minutes after taking the medication. I have taken a Ca channel blocker (diltiazem) in the past; but that did not seem effective. So here's the question. The beta and calcium channel blockers as you of course know are referred to as ""rate control"" medications; yet they don't do a thing to my heart rate while I am in afib or flutter (though the beta blocker does reduce my resting heart rate when not in tachycardia; the Ca blocker not so much.) But the beta blocker does seem to reduce the length of the episodes compared to how long they last if I just let it go; so this seems to be some sort of rhythm control. (And again; the Ca blocker does not seem to be effective at this either; which is why it is a former medication.) Is my experience with these medications common in your experience - that is; some rhythm control but little effective rate control?

My doctor has put me on 240 mg of diltiazem; which has solved neither my heart rate issue or blood pressure (still high). My EP told me that I have inappropriate sinus tacky cardia; and that I may just have it for the remainder of my life. My current worry is that when i'm at the gym my heart rate is generally around 175; but will rise to about 200. I get short of breath; so I stop. My doctor assures me that this is okay; but if I'm on medication to control the heart rate and its still that high; I don't understand how thats normal. I also sometimes feel palpations; but I had a heart monitor test and it didn't show any major abnormalities (I couldn't wear it when at the gym). I don't know what to do at this point. I'm at such a loss and feeling so out of control with my body. If anyone has any diagnosis suggestions I would sincerely appreciate it; or just to share your story.

221,221,Diltiazem+hypertension,I talked with Gail a little while ago and she sounds good. She got out of the hospital last Wed. and for some unfathomable reason they still don't know what is wrong with her. She is on oxygen so she is kind of under house arrest until they figure it out. She had been waiting to get in to see this heart Dr where she lives; but he has not seemed in any big hurry so she has made an appt with either a heart specialist or heart clinic in Paducah for next Thurs. The Dr that referred her to the local heart guy told Gail that this heart guy thought of himself as semi retired and I am thinking he is semi retarded. She tried like crazy to get in touch with him and he still hasn't returned her calls. She has cancer for God's sake you don't put people off like that. I think her Dr said that the heart guy was reluctant to do surgeries because of this semi retirement and I didn't catch if that was pertaining to Gail or in general. I was on a cell phone and she is sucking oxygen so it was hard to hear and I didn't want to keep asking you to repeat yourself because you were starting to sound winded. Sorry; I won't talk about you like you are not here. Anyhow; they still think it is Pulmonary Hypertension and it can be treated with; of all things; Viagra. They think it is this PH thing because she is just fine on the oxygen (well; as fine as you can be hooked up to a tank) but 5 minutes without it and she is gasping for air. The Viagra makes sense; since it increases blood flow; but in her case it will be to the lungs. This is from the American Heart Association: The blood vessels that supply the lungs constrict and their walls thicken; so they can't carry as much blood. As in a kinked garden hose; pressure builds up and backs up. The heart works harder; trying to force the blood through. If the pressure is high enough; eventually the heart can't keep up; and less blood can circulate through the lungs to pick up oxygen. Patients then become tired; dizzy and short of breath. Here is the link if you would like to learn more. http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11076 She said she has been sleeping alot; but that is probably for the best anyway. Oh; another friend of hers on here called her Dr @ MD Anderson and told him what was going on (good for you; what a good friend) and her Dr got in touch with her local guy and they are changing her chemo; but I am sorry; I didn't hear what it was; but she won't have to go back on chemo until after her next trip to MD Anderson June 25th & 26th.

224,224,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 28 years old and otherwise a healthy individual. Last April I woke up one day with what I believe to have been atrial fibrillation; but by the time the EMT's arrived; I had converted. The doctor's at the hospital told me not to sweat it. I then had about two more episodes of atrial fibrillation after binge drinking the night before; but converted on my own. I did not think there was much of a problem until about a month and a half ago when I started to get PVC's every night. Then about a week after they began; I woke up with my heart wildly out of control. The EMT's came and hooked me up on a 12 lead and determined that I had a heart rate of about 280 bpm and that I was in atrial fibrillation along with Vtach and PVC's. I went to the hospital and stayed about 4 days. They thought maybe WPW; but my echo and stress test were negative for the delta wave or any other problems. I had an EP study performed; whereby my elecrophysiologist concluded atrial fibrillation. However; I think this conclusion was based on the notion that they were unable to reproduce my arrhythmia; so AFib was the default answer. I have been doing extensive research and thought my arrhythmias were related to GERD because I had noticed my PVC's were worse after acid reflux. It got to the point that every time I would lay down; I would have constant PVC's. On Thanksgiving I had bad heartburn; one alcoholic beverage; and atrial fibrillation the next morning. I had gone on a GERD friendly diet waiting to see the physician; and I magically felt a lot better. However; a few days later I started having PVC's at night again; but this time it was not when I laid down; but rather after I had slept for awhile. I had a barium swallow; which came back negative for GERD; but positive for duodenitis. Feeling lost as to my problem; I came across information about vagally mediated atrial fibrillation; which seemed to make the most sense. I believe my duodenitis to be caused by an over-secretion of stomach acid due to the vagus nerve; which is why the test was negative as to GERD. I am also male; young; otherwise healthy heart; former military and athlete. I now have PVC's; which occur after about every 5-7 hours of sleep. I can I get up for a few hours and then go back to bed (assuming my vagal tone is not so high) and I can sleep without palpitations. I feel my heart rate is not as consistent anymore as it used to be. My resting rate is about 75-85 bpm; but goes up to about 120 or 130 when I stand up and walk around. So my questions are: (1) does this sound like vagally mediated atrial fibrillation and PVC's? (2) is an ablation a viable option for vagally mediated atrial fibrillation? (3) are there any tests that can be performed to check the function of the vagus nerve? (4) Should I also see a neurologist; and if so are there any subspecialties to look for that focus on the vagus nerve? I should note that I am seeing my electrophysiologist this week; and I am scheduled to see a gastroenterologist sometime soon. I am on diltiazem; but I only take as needed to convert out of AFib. However; I have taken the dilitiazem hoping it would help with the PVC's; but it did not seem to make a difference; and maybe even made them worse.,2010,2010,27,Male,,,[],"[28, 12]",I 28 years old otherwise healthy individual Last April I woke one day I believe atrial fibrillation time EMT arrived I converted The doctor hospital told sweat I two episodes atrial fibrillation binge drinking night converted I think much problem month half ago I started get PVC every night Then week began I woke heart wildly control The EMT came hooked 12 lead determined I heart rate 280 bpm I atrial fibrillation along Vtach PVC I went hospital stayed 4 days They thought maybe WPW echo stress test negative delta wave problems I EP study performed whereby elecrophysiologist concluded atrial fibrillation However I think conclusion based notion unable reproduce arrhythmia AFib default answer I extensive research thought arrhythmias related GERD I noticed PVC worse acid reflux It got point every time I would lay I would constant PVC On Thanksgiving I bad heartburn one alcoholic beverage atrial fibrillation next morning I gone GERD friendly diet waiting see physician I magically felt lot better However days later I started PVC night time I laid rather I slept awhile I barium swallow came back negative GERD positive duodenitis Feeling lost problem I came across information vagally mediated atrial fibrillation seemed make sense I believe duodenitis caused secretion stomach acid due vagus nerve test negative GERD I also male young otherwise healthy heart former military athlete I PVC occur every 5 7 hours sleep I I get hours go back bed assuming vagal tone high I sleep without palpitations I feel heart rate consistent anymore used My resting rate 75 85 bpm goes 120 130 I stand walk around So questions 1 sound like vagally mediated atrial fibrillation PVC 2 ablation viable option vagally mediated atrial fibrillation 3 tests performed check function vagus nerve 4 Should I also see neurologist subspecialties look focus vagus nerve I note I seeing electrophysiologist week I scheduled see gastroenterologist sometime soon I diltiazem I take needed convert AFib However I taken dilitiazem hoping would help PVC seem make difference maybe even made worse,I 28 year old otherwis healthi individu last april I woke one day I believ atrial fibril time emt arriv I convert the doctor hospit told sweat I two episod atrial fibril bing drink night convert I think much problem month half ago I start get pvc everi night then week began I woke heart wildli control the emt came hook 12 lead determin I heart rate 280 bpm I atrial fibril along vtach pvc I went hospit stay 4 day they thought mayb wpw echo stress test neg delta wave problem I EP studi perform wherebi elecrophysiologist conclud atrial fibril howev I think conclus base notion unabl reproduc arrhythmia afib default answer I extens research thought arrhythmia relat gerd I notic pvc wors acid reflux It got point everi time I would lay I would constant pvc On thanksgiv I bad heartburn one alcohol beverag atrial fibril next morn I gone gerd friendli diet wait see physician I magic felt lot better howev day later I start pvc night time I laid rather I slept awhil I barium swallow came back neg gerd posit duoden feel lost problem I came across inform vagal mediat atrial fibril seem make sens I believ duoden caus secret stomach acid due vagu nerv test neg gerd I also male young otherwis healthi heart former militari athlet I pvc occur everi 5 7 hour sleep I I get hour go back bed assum vagal tone high I sleep without palpit I feel heart rate consist anymor use My rest rate 75 85 bpm goe 120 130 I stand walk around So question 1 sound like vagal mediat atrial fibril pvc 2 ablat viabl option vagal mediat atrial fibril 3 test perform check function vagu nerv 4 should I also see neurologist subspecialti look focu vagu nerv I note I see electrophysiologist week I schedul see gastroenterologist sometim soon I diltiazem I take need convert afib howev I taken dilitiazem hope would help pvc seem make differ mayb even made wors,1,7,1,"[""Heartburn""]","[""Fibrillation"", ""Duodenitis"", ""Premature ventricular contractions"", ""Tachycardia, Ventricular"", ""Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome"", ""Atrial Fibrillation"", ""Gastroesophageal reflux disease""]","[""Binge eating disorder""]"

226,226,Diltiazem+hypertension,I was diagnosed with mild left ventricular hypertrophy due probably to hypertension and told to treat the hypertension and not to worry. I had this condition for at least two years before I knew about it. It was called to my attention by an echo report in my records while attending a new physician. I have had some very rare pvcs and pacs showing up since my twenties. Suddenly lots of pacs showed up on a monitor in 2002 along with a regular two a minute about that time. There were thousands of pacs. This alarmed me ; but I was told they were benign. They seemed to go away for several years. Then in 2006- 2007 I began to have night attacks of high blood pressure and rapid pulse up to 120-150bpm at times; These were about every 3 -5 months; sometimes more and would sometimes send me to the E.R.. These attacks are very scary when waking up out of sleep usually 1:30 or 3:00 A.M. No one could decide why. Theory was anxiety attacks; or med not holding twenty four hours. I take hyzaar 50/12.5 and taztia for diltiazem 120 extended release q day. Then in February of this year I awoke in a -fibrillation went to the E.R. by ambulance and was kept at the hospital overnight. I converted into a regular rhythm with use of lanoxin and digoxin and heparin by 4:00 the next afternoon. I had just seen a cardiologist the Monday before for these recurrent night episodes and was told that I did not even need a cardiologist until this suprised even him. I saw him again the Monday after the a-fib. He said that he would just watch me and not even change any meds right now. I'm 59 and was in really good health before . This lvh disgnosis and the a-fib attack have really scared me. Can you please tell me anything about this to help my confidence or to just help me to be more informed? What more can I do?

227,227,Diltiazem+hypertension,"In october of last year; I went to the hospital with chest pains. My bp was 195/110. they gave me three nitro glycerin tablets before it came down. The blood test revealed no negative enzymes. That was a sat. night and I was admitted to the hospital and put on a nitro patch. 5 AM monday morning; the ekg showed that I had ""flipped my t-waves."" Up to that point the ekg hadn't changed. Tues. morning I was transferred to another hospital for a heart cath. That revealed no damage but the doctor said that part of my heart was not beating with the rest. I believe it was the anterior apical. The diagnosis based on the above info was that I had a coronary artery spasm. that there was some damage to my heart but they felt it was reverseable. I was told I have prinzmetal's angina also. I went to cardiac rehab for 3 months and was working out 4 days a weeks at the gym after I finished the rehab. A few weeks ago; I went to SLC; Utah. On both planes on the way out I had chest pains and took my nitro. The next day I had chest pains 2 more times. The hotel called the paramedics and I was taken to the er. My bp was again 190/110. I had chest pains again in the hospital and they gave me nitro and it finally came down and stayed down. After 6 hours they released me. The cardio- logist at the er in Utah said he thought I got cehst pains because of the high bp and that he wasn't convinced it was angina or that I had a CAS in October. I was dizzy off and on for the week that I was there but I thought this was due to the altitude (I live at sea level and SLC is 4500 ft.) When I returned home I was still dizzy. Went to my cardiologist and my bp was 200/100. He put me on diovan and sent me for a renal scan with flow (nuclear). the results of the renal scan were R>L 55>45. that was a couple of weeks ago. the diovan is keeping my bp around 110/70. the cario. wanted me to go to our local community hospital and have a renal angiogram and possible angioplasty. This hasn't been done at this hospital before and I don't think I want to be the first. My primary physician is sending me to another cardiologist at Temple University in Phila. for a second opinion. I see him on the 22nd of this month. This is where I get confused. Why a second cardiologist? Should I be seeing a different kind of specialist? Sorry I forgot to mention that I am 48 year old female. My father had a heart attack at 54 and he had high blood pressure although he was an acute alcoholic so I assumed the bp was from the alcohol. I don't drink (haven't in 19 years); stopped smoking 3 years ago. Smoked from 18 to 26; didn't smoke from 26 to 36; smoked from 36 to 45. I take cardizem cd 300mg; lipitor 10mg; premarin 1.25 and one aspirin daily. And now diovan 80 mg. From what I have read 55>45 doesn't sound definitive for blockage but I was told that normally the left kidney has greater flow then the right.

228,228,Diltiazem+hypertension,Ever since I was diagnosed with what was thought to be a MI; I have been seeking the answer to what happened. I have had a DR. here on Cleveland Clinic say from the sTress tEst I was given and the symptoms that it sounded like I did indeed have a MI; allthough a mild one probably. Also the Stress tests indicated that I may have had one and some area of damage; or what is called Stunned Myocardium. The first cardioloigst I went to did a Catherization which showed no blockages and then a Echocardiogram. I saw him today and haven't got the actuall report yet; but he told me from the symptoms I have that he now thinks what I have is Vaso spasms of the heart; or atypical angina. He talked about calcium channel blockers and using the nitro I am already taking. He based this on the symptoms and the fact that taking the nitro helped with chest symptoms after taking Nitro. The question started when I asked about Ischemia and parts of the heart not getting enough blood; / oxygen; and if you don't have blocked arteries; if you could still have symptoms if you are not getting enough blood. He said yes; then I asked about if there was any connection between Raynaulds disease and Ischemic Disease of the heart. I dont think he gave me a direct answer; but this question gave him some intersest; and when he found out I have suffered from Raynaulds since the 1980's; he seemed to be putting two and two together. The other thing I thought was interesting; was than this initial attack was very strong; and that I had several clusters of them close together from begginning of April till the end of May. I have not had a Angina attack for about 3 weeks. My attacks came with no exertion or exercise; no foods or undue stress. The fact is that I have been MORE STRESSED SINCE THE INITIAL ATTACK; BECAUSE I HAVE NOT FOUND THE CAUSE OR DEFINITE DIAGNOSIS. So it was not anxiety; panic disorder; GERD; or anything similiar. I have severeal EKGS that mention possible Mycardial Ischmic disease. How is that diagnosed or can it be diagnosed? Has anyone else had a connection between Raynaulds Disease and this Coronary Vasospasms of the heart? I have read different things on the Web about Pretmetals Angina; is this the same thing? How often do these attacks come and go or how do you know when you will get an attack? One thing I read talked about doing the same thing you do for Heart disease; such as lowering the prevention like high blood pressure and high cholesteral; and smoking. I take meds for high blood pressure and cholesteral; and I quit smoking 30 years ago. What other things can I do to keep this under controll? I am still wondering why the dr on Cleveland Clinic had the ( apparently ) wrong diagnosis from the stress test?

229,229,Diltiazem+hypertension,After one week I have still been experiencing side effects of 25mg Atenolol including lethargy; occasional muscle pains in feet; cold extremities; overall tiredness. The most disturbing is the short breathed; pressure feeling in my chest. Last night while laughing I had some wheezing and productive coughing (some fluid). I have bronchitis during severe chest colds and the wheezing was similar although I did not need my inhaler. How long does it take for one to get accustomed to these side effects or are they permanent? The most disturbing is the short breath/pressure in the center of my chest. Is this chest pain or is it centered in the lungs since Atenolol supposedly constricts bronchioles? Otherwise; my BP lowers to 115-120/65-70 with a heart rate of 55-65.

230,230,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hi; I have a nonfunctional pituitary microadenoma and was wondering when surgery is indicated. I have been to MGH for a brief appointment and they suggested that they do surgery when the tumor grows over 1 cm. This is due to the fact that in their experience; the tumors continue to grow once over 1 cm. At the time of my appointment last year; my adenoma measured 8mm x 5mm x 7mm. They thought it would probably never grow. However; a recent MRI showed that it has slight enlargement at 8mm x 9mm x 7mm. I have adrenal insufficiency secondary to ACTH insufficiency but no other hormones are deficient yet. The tumor is located along the right cavernous sinus but doesn't invade the cavernous sinus yet. I have a few questions about this. 1. When does the Cleveland Clinic operate on nonfunction pituitary microadenomas? 2. Do you ever see ACTH as being the only affected stimulating hormone or the first deficient stimulating hormone? Also; I have some T2 hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the brain consistent with microvascular changes. I'm only 39 and have some kind of autoimmune process with anticardiolipin antibodies. Could this be the cause? Should I be evaluated for something else? The pattern of the T2 hyperintensities is not consistent with MS. Could it be caused by Lyme? Will they progress?

233,233,Diltiazem+hypertension,I cross-posted this in hopes of getting different perspectives on what I've have been experiencing. Please feel free to read the first thread I posted in the anxiety forum (I'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well; just a heads-up) for a detailed history of my anxiety; and possible heart problems. My recent issue has been that I wake up in the middle of the night with an elevated pulse that skyrockets within moments of waking up. I went back to the cardiologist on Thursday; and she told me the EKG showed a thickening of the heart muscle. She then reviewed my echo from about two years ago and told me that it showed signs of thickening as well. I went to the cardiologist in the hopes of allaying some of my health anxiety and now its worse. I'm a bit miffed that the other doctor didn't keep me informed as to what was going on with my echo. All I ever heard was that my valves leaked a bit but not an abnormal amount for my age (29). I'm going in for a new echo on Monday; and I'll be doing a stress test soon. The stress test scares me because I've got to stay off of my Atenolol for 48 hours before hand; so I'll have to deal with my pulse being elevated; and probably worse incidents of my heart racing.

234,234,Diltiazem+hypertension,I spent a weekend in the hospital on June 18 and 19th. The dx was atrial fibrillation and flutter (156 bpm). I was given Metoprolol 100mg twice per day and Diltiazem once per day; plus an injectable blood thinner which I was able to discontinue 3 days after my release. I was also started on warfarin 5 mg once per day in the hospital. My only symptom was shortness of breath after walking about 20 feet. There was nothing else such as pain. I had a cardiac cath about 6 years ago; but it was a mistake. I had no cardiac disease; I had a potassium level of 2. I was fine after potassium supplementation. I had a calcium scan 2 years ago at a cardiac center here and my score was 0; so I don't think I have any cardiac disease now either other than the new electrical problems and previously diagnosed bradycardia (50/55 bpm). I was released and told to see the cardiologist in 1 to 2 weeks. It's actually going to be 3 weeks post discharge when I finally see him. I'm not really any better now. I still can't walk more than 20 ft. sometimes less; without running out of breath. I still have no pain and feel normal when I'm sitting still. My bpm is down; perhaps too down (46 bpm). I sometimes felt I was losing consciousness when I was walking. The hospital knows I have bradycardia because they are in my clinic's network and share records. I'm not being monitored with a Holter nor was I asked to call with a status report. I did call them last weekend and asked the on-call about my faintness and he said cut the Metoprolol by half. Still not much different. I am being kept clot free I hope. They are monitoring my INR level weekly which I believe today was 3.1. I'm worried that I'm being left to my own devices a little too much. This is what happened with the cardiac cath episode. After the procedure; I was told no cardiac problems. No one told me that a potassium level of 2 needed to be corrected (it actually was up to 3.2 after the IVs and tablets). I had to figure it out by myself what was wrong and actually had to ask for a potassium prescription. My internist had not ordered a potassium level for 1 1/2 years even though I was taking a diuretic for borderline hypertension. Should I be taking something other than what I'm taking to lower bpm? Is there something I should be taking to normalize the atrial rhythm. This situation has turned me into a virtual invalid overnight. The other question I had is; I guess; somewhat controversial. The ER cardiac doc said no way A-Fib could be caused by vagus nerve irritation caused by GERD. I have very persistent GERD in spite of Prilosec 20mg 2 times per day. I get these big rushes of acid when I'm very hungry which result in overwhelming nausea; sometimes to the point where I sneeze violently several times. This does relieve the nausea. These aren't normal sneezes where you get a tickle - these are command sneezes. I also get esophageal spasms which feel like a heart attack except I can make them go away by taking large swallows of water. Oddly enough; the pain radiates up my body from my stomach into my left upper jaw. What do you think?

236,236,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 25 year old caucasian male of irish descent. Ever since being physically active as a child; I have had problems with muscle cramping. Strenuous and semi stressful physical exertion would often be accompanied by extreme painful muscle cramping in major leg and arm muscles. Making it difficult to move; let alone lift a particular arm or leg. Growing up I had a normal childhood riding bikes; playing baseball; tag; all the sorts of things young kids do. Often times the cramping would never present itself. Appears to almost be random. In highschool I ran cross country (not very well; however; often finished last in races due to extreme muscle cramping/pain; but I always finished a race; running through the pain. Went on to do some track and also some tennis; along with some bowling. Have experienced this extreme cramping/pain in all of these sports at one time or another. In college I did competitive fencing for two years. For the first year or so; it seemd that I was no longer presenting the symptoms described. However; a year into it I had a very stressful match and ended cramping across my entire body; not being able to move. Again; had to fight through the pain. Along with the painful cramping; another symptom has consistently presented itself. My muscles; in random places on the body; sometimes twitch or spasm. The spasms rarely last for more than 1 or 2 seconds; and seem to be random occurences. They sometimes will happen in the same area randomly for up to 10-15 minutes. It is very; very inconsistent. I also randomly somtimes experience medium to severe chest pain at random moments in time; often not accompanied with any cramping; muscle spasms; or physical activity. It can happen anywhere. Sitting down at the computer. Driving. Doing physical activity. Not doing physical activity. I had tests done at the Cleveland Clinic and they were not able to diagnose the issue. I had raised CPK and CK levels in unnaceptable leves in the thousands. However; no other enzyme or blood levels were out of whack. I had three muscle biopsies. One in my right upper thigh muscle; and one on each forearm. Tests were negative for any kinds of myopathies. Tests were negative for any severe neurological diseases like MS; MLS or any other sort of degenerative muscle disorders. Acid reflux has been toted as a likely candidate for the chest pains. Prevacid and Prilosec have both reduced chest pains slightly. However; the medium to severe chest pains have presented themselves at times when acid reflux could not possibly have been the culprit. I recently had a colonoscopy performed due to my family having a history of colon cancer. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. There was a worry that I might have inherited Crohns from my mothers side of the family; but that was not the case. I also did not appear to have IBS or anything of the sort. The only other thing I can tell you is that I have been told I have a condition called malignant hypothermia. A disorder that all anesthesialogists must be aware of prior to giving me any form of anesthesia. The Cleveland Clinic did a number of tests on me; including blood draws; muscle biopsies; ekg; though; I don't quite remember of an MRI or CT was performed. This was done when I was 19 years old. I have not had any further look into this since then; and I'm wondering what my next steps should be. Besides the unexplained muscle cramps/spasms and chest pains; I am a very healthy 25 year old male. I'm perhaps 10-15 pounds overweight; but then again who isnt. I have seasonal allergies to ragweed; pollen; mold; dust; all those. I have however never gotten an allergy ***** test. However; I'm not allergic to any of the major things like penicillin; peanuts or latex. I typically get a strep throat infection almost perhaps like clockwork every spring and fall. I don't have any sexually transmitted infections; I have never done any intravenous drugs. I've occasionally smoked marijuana and i have ingested psylocibin mushrooms one time in my entire life. I have also never broken a bone in my entire body. Mentally I have had issues with both depression and anxiety; often brought on; especially as a child; by these bizarre cramping events. Imagine having a ton of fun with other kids; only to be made fun of because I couldn't play anymore due to extreme muscle pain/soreness; being told by gym teachers and sports coaches to suck it up and quit complaining; or being called lazy because I simply could not continue with a certain physical activity due to extreme cramping and muscle pain. Also; I was told by one of the doctors that I should avoid massive amounts of caffiene. Is there any truth to this? If so; how much caffiene is bad; and should I avoid drinking anything that contains caffiene such as soda; coffee or energy drinks. On a side note; when I watch the show House M.D. I wish there were a doctor smart enough to diagnose whatever the hell it is that I have. Isn't fiction television grand :p My main concern is this.

239,239,Diltiazem+hypertension,I have been constipated the last couple of weeks. I took some Senokot last Tuesday to help with this. Then on Wednesday I had a bowel movement. It was really hard to pass the stools. I noticed there was blood on my stools and on the toilet paper. I went to a doctor the same day and was told it was an anal fissure. The doctor gave me hydrocortisone suppositories. I took these for a couple of days; but had to stop using them because it was too painful to use them. Also; that same day I drank some prune juice. This caused me to have diarrhea; which worsened the pain. Ever since Wednesday I have been in so much pain I have not been able to sit up; therefore have not been able to work. I have to lay on my side; I cannot even ride in a car. The pain is constant; not just when having a bowel movement. I have increased my fiber intake and fluid intake and now I'm having 1-2 soft bowel movements per day. I have been taking 3-4 tub baths in plain warm water a day. I have tried using hydrocortisone cream and anesthetic cream. None of this seems to be helping. I also noticed something strange when I was applying the cream. It looks like there is something hanging from my anus. I can't tell if it is skin or a hemorrhoid; but the doctor did not mention it. I also feel constant pressure there; like something is pushing down on me. I haven't noticed anymore blood in my stool. And yesterday I started to have itching and burning (like I'm on fire) there also. I'm not sure what to do. How long do fissures take to heal? How long do they take to stop causing so much pain? I can't miss anymore work from this; but I can't even sit up. I'm typing this standing. Could I have something else going on with me besides a fissure?

240,240,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Here's something that might buy some valuable time and help in a blood pressure spike. I had them for years and then not. Recently the last two or three days - I had bp go to 169/85 and I'm currently trying to figure out what caused that. I got up and had two cokes and 2 cups of coffee and we had breakfast (bought at cracker barrel restaurant) Most of the day both times it was in the 111/64 to 135/70 range - then suddenly shot up late in the day and reached over 150/75. I took extra medicationa and it didn't come down. So I'm going to tell you of a method to bring down a spike - unless caused by some secondary reason such as organ failure. its' not pleasant but it sure beats a stroke or heart attack. This is the use of prune juice to clean your sytem. I drink 32 ounces as fast as I can and I stay near the bathroom (obviously ) After passing a lot of fluid out - the pressure in the arteries goes down as fluids equalize thoughout the body. I used to be on the Bloodpressureline - where endocrinologist and hard to control hypertension specialist Dr. Clarence Grim was and when told of the prune juice method he said ""maybe we should have some clinical trials of that) He may have been joking but it works. If you drink the prune juice within an hour you will be dropping fluids in 1.5 hours and for me and most people the blood pressure will drop fast. I would stay near the bathroom. I don't personally like prune juice but we keep it on hand all the time and I used it today and yesterday and it got my bp down into thw 120/65 range and it will go lower tonight. After this all my meds work better as my bp stays down as long as I don't eat salt or what I'm suspicious of - Coffee - I take cardizem (diltiazem) and lasix. One guy on the blood pressure forum tried it and said ""I got a very nice reduction in blood pressure - but then I went and replenished the fluid that was lost and the bp came back up."" He didn't understand that most people - especially those overweight carry way too much fluid in their bodies and you take some out and you dont restore it. So if you are thinking you might be going to have a stroke or heart attack because of high blood pressure - give it a try and you should see a reduction in bp within a couple of hours. We have had times when me taking more medication did not bring the blood pressure down and the Prune Juice was the only thing that worked. My wife also has high blood pressure and was going to use ""pruny"" we call it but she hates it too. She was able to cut back on her fluid intake and her bp went down. We think it is salt and in fact when we keep the salt intake down bp stays down too - that and I love my coffee and sometimes drink too much.

243,243,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am a 44 year old registered nurse; who for the last 8 months have had right upper quadrant pain; sometimes radiating round to the back and bouts of heavy nausea. Previously in May I was diagnosed with tiny scattered ulcers from the stomach through to the small intestine; this was thought to be related to the anti-imflammatory's I had been taking for acute back pain previously experience in mid Feb to mid March. This problem is cuurently resolved. However; the ruqp and nausea has continued and after a trip to A&E who ruled out a perforated ulcer after bloods and x-rays were taken; and an admittance due to dehydration and pain mx my specialist just monitored my symptoms and treated with Motilium and analgesia. I continued to experience actue episodes of ruqp and nausea and called my gastroenterologist to help me. He arrange for me to be admitted for tests and after an Endoscopic U/S sludge was discovered in the Gall Bladder; and it was decided to remove the GB immediately. The surgeon was certain the sludge in the GB was due to 20 KGs I had loss from dieting from Feb 09 to June 09. After post -op pain had subsided I still had bouts of nausea and occasional ruqp. I visited the specialist before I took a 5 week holiday in the UK. It was decided I would continue to take the Motilium and analgesia as required. My first night I was gripped with horrendous abdominal pain totally different to before more mid-upper and under rib pain which took my breath away to descibe would say these were more like a spasm pains. I had 3 waves of these pains which all lasted about 2 minutes each and left me feeling very nauseous. Over the next 4 5 weeks the nausea came in waves and pain was intermittant. Then in Mid-October these spasm pains returned with a vengence. The next day my specialist mentioned a dysfunction called 'Sphincter of Oddi'; bloods taken were negative and he just gave me alternative options to control these spasms and nausea. Tiny mini-like-spasms felt leading up to xmas were manageable; then xmas morning the spasm came out of the blue; unbale to take the Buscopan until pain subsided I was unable to eat/drink anything all day; eating around 18.00 that evening; the same pattern the next day with some back shoulder blade pain that kept me awake all night; with one addition the sharp stabbing pain right-sided and under the ribs (just like GB pain). this became unabearable and so visited the casualty Dept; unable to be canulated due to being dehydrated; bloods were finally taken but were nagative; my pain score as the spasm and sharp pains came and went were very hight 8-9/10. I was later transferred to my pivate hospital and looked after by the specialist; where I was treated with IM Buscopan and Morphine Tabs and IM over the next 8 days. My specialist is certain I have SODD but his partner is reluctant to perform the ERCP as the risk of Pancreatitis is high; but I have been started on Diltiazem mg QID and Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg one am and two nocte. what evidence is there to suggest these two drugs will help my symptoms and after how long will I noticce they are haviing an effect; and how long will I need to take them???,2010,2010,45,Female,,,[],"[44, 5]",I 44 year old registered nurse last 8 months right upper quadrant pain sometimes radiating round back bouts heavy nausea Previously May I diagnosed tiny scattered ulcers stomach small intestine thought related anti imflammatory I taking acute back pain previously experience mid Feb mid March This problem cuurently resolved However ruqp nausea continued trip A E ruled perforated ulcer bloods x rays taken admittance due dehydration pain mx specialist monitored symptoms treated Motilium analgesia I continued experience actue episodes ruqp nausea called gastroenterologist help He arrange admitted tests Endoscopic U S sludge discovered Gall Bladder decided remove GB immediately The surgeon certain sludge GB due 20 KGs I loss dieting Feb 09 June 09 After post op pain subsided I still bouts nausea occasional ruqp I visited specialist I took 5 week holiday UK It decided I would continue take Motilium analgesia required My first night I gripped horrendous abdominal pain totally different mid upper rib pain took breath away descibe would say like spasm pains I 3 waves pains lasted 2 minutes left feeling nauseous Over next 4 5 weeks nausea came waves pain intermittant Then Mid October spasm pains returned vengence The next day specialist mentioned dysfunction called Sphincter Oddi bloods taken negative gave alternative options control spasms nausea Tiny mini like spasms felt leading xmas manageable xmas morning spasm came blue unbale take Buscopan pain subsided I unable eat drink anything day eating around 18 00 evening pattern next day back shoulder blade pain kept awake night one addition sharp stabbing pain right sided ribs like GB pain became unabearable visited casualty Dept unable canulated due dehydrated bloods finally taken nagative pain score spasm sharp pains came went hight 8 9 10 I later transferred pivate hospital looked specialist I treated IM Buscopan Morphine Tabs IM next 8 days My specialist certain I SODD partner reluctant perform ERCP risk Pancreatitis high I started Diltiazem mg QID Ursodeoxycholic Acid 250mg one two nocte evidence suggest two drugs help symptoms long I noticce haviing effect long I need take,I 44 year old regist nurs last 8 month right upper quadrant pain sometim radiat round back bout heavi nausea previous may I diagnos tini scatter ulcer stomach small intestin thought relat anti imflammatori I take acut back pain previous experi mid feb mid march thi problem cuurent resolv howev ruqp nausea continu trip A E rule perfor ulcer blood x ray taken admitt due dehydr pain mx specialist monitor symptom treat motilium analgesia I continu experi actu episod ruqp nausea call gastroenterologist help He arrang admit test endoscop U S sludg discov gall bladder decid remov GB immedi the surgeon certain sludg GB due 20 kg I loss diet feb 09 june 09 after post op pain subsid I still bout nausea occasion ruqp I visit specialist I took 5 week holiday UK It decid I would continu take motilium analgesia requir My first night I grip horrend abdomin pain total differ mid upper rib pain took breath away descib would say like spasm pain I 3 wave pain last 2 minut left feel nauseou over next 4 5 week nausea came wave pain intermitt then mid octob spasm pain return vengenc the next day specialist mention dysfunct call sphincter oddi blood taken neg gave altern option control spasm nausea tini mini like spasm felt lead xma manag xma morn spasm came blue unbal take buscopan pain subsid I unabl eat drink anyth day eat around 18 00 even pattern next day back shoulder blade pain kept awak night one addit sharp stab pain right side rib like GB pain becam unabear visit casualti dept unabl canul due dehydr blood final taken nag pain score spasm sharp pain came went hight 8 9 10 I later transfer pivat hospit look specialist I treat IM buscopan morphin tab IM next 8 day My specialist certain I sodd partner reluct perform ercp risk pancreat high I start diltiazem mg qid ursodeoxychol acid 250mg one two noct evid suggest two drug help symptom long I noticc havi effect long I need take,4,4,1,"[""Pain"", ""Nausea"", ""Muscle Cramp"", ""Spasm""]","[""Ulcer"", ""Dysfunction"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy"", ""Influenza""]","[""Agnosia for Pain""]"
244,244,Diltiazem+hypertension,I am 47 year old male; very athletic but unfortunately 4 months ago I had a heart attack/my left ventricle artery was 100% occluded/ and 2 regular metal stents were placed in my left artery. It was a big shock for everybody; especially for me; since my cholesterol was 170 at that time and even during my heart attack my blood pressure was 124/80. Plus genetically nobody has had or died of heart attack among my relatives. I do not eat fried or fast food so my diet was generally ok. My pain never stopped after that- I was experiencing constant chest pressure and shortness of breath but my doctor here did not pay any attention. He was saying that “etiology of my pain is not known but it shouldn’t be anything cardiac since my stress test was ok”.Last month I ended up in the emergency room with re-stenosis /one of the stents was clogged 99% and another stent was placed on the top of those two. This time was Xience 5- drug eluted stent that went on the top of the other two. The doctor started paying a little attention and even apologize that he did not listen to me.Since then/it’s been only a month/ I continue to experience the same problems. Every day I have pain- it doesn’t matter if I exercise or just sit in my office. The pain may start in the middle of the chest but moves to right or left; goes to back/upper part only/ and my shoulders/. Right above my breast bones hurt sometimes more and it is very tender to touch. Before I had my heart attack; I have never experienced anything like that- everything started after the stents were placed. Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated- I can not function normally. I hope the stem cell science will advance much faster than we anticipate and will bring a new avenue and hope to people like us.,2010,2010,47,Male,,,['124/80'],[47],I 47 year old male athletic unfortunately 4 months ago I heart attack left ventricle artery 100 occluded 2 regular metal stents placed left artery It big shock everybody especially since cholesterol 170 time even heart attack blood pressure 124 80 Plus genetically nobody died heart attack among relatives I eat fried fast food diet generally ok My pain never stopped I experiencing constant chest pressure shortness breath doctor pay attention He saying etiology pain known anything cardiac since stress test ok Last month I ended emergency room stenosis one stents clogged 99 another stent placed top two This time Xience 5 drug eluted stent went top two The doctor started paying little attention even apologize listen Since month I continue experience problems Every day I pain matter I exercise sit office The pain may start middle chest moves right left goes back upper part shoulders Right breast bones hurt sometimes tender touch Before I heart attack I never experienced anything like everything started stents placed Any suggestions comments greatly appreciated I function normally I hope stem cell science advance much faster anticipate bring new avenue hope people like us,I 47 year old male athlet unfortun 4 month ago I heart attack left ventricl arteri 100 occlud 2 regular metal stent place left arteri It big shock everybodi especi sinc cholesterol 170 time even heart attack blood pressur 124 80 plu genet nobodi die heart attack among rel I eat fri fast food diet gener ok My pain never stop I experienc constant chest pressur short breath doctor pay attent He say etiolog pain known anyth cardiac sinc stress test ok last month I end emerg room stenosi one stent clog 99 anoth stent place top two thi time xienc 5 drug elut stent went top two the doctor start pay littl attent even apolog listen sinc month I continu experi problem everi day I pain matter I exercis sit offic the pain may start middl chest move right left goe back upper part shoulder right breast bone hurt sometim tender touch befor I heart attack I never experienc anyth like everyth start stent place ani suggest comment greatli appreci I function normal I hope stem cell scienc advanc much faster anticip bring new avenu hope peopl like us,1,1,0,"[""Pain""]","[""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy""]",[]
245,245,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Prograf is a medicine that slows down the bodys immune system. For this reason; it works as an anti-rejection medicine. Prograf helps patients who have had a liver/kidney transplant protect their new organ and prevent it from being rejected by the body. This medicine can cause the amount of potassium in your blood-stream to increase. For this reason you should avoid large amounts of foods that have a high potassium content; for example dried fruit; bananas; tomatoes and low sodium salt; while you are taking this medicine; also avoid potassium supplements. I had a bad reaction from eating these foods. I had been warned about grapefruit juice; as it increases the amount of Prograf in the blood-stream. I did not know about the problems with other foods. Being a health food addict; this is what I eat. I had noticed I had not felt good for a couple of days but did not think that much about it. After about 3 days I knew something wasn't right with my body. I went to the emergency room at my local hospital and after many blood tests I found out that I had too much potassium in my body. I was fortunate the level was not that high. It was an easy cure and I'am fine; (no damage to me or my new liver); but I wanted to warn everyone about this. My doctor told me there are many foods that are being tested to see what there reaction is when Prograf is used by a transplant recipient. The new foods being tested are all citrus fruits. Pomegranate and apricots are now being studied to see if they have the same effect as grapefruit juice; (increasing Prograf levels). My doctors advise to me is; ""If you eat something and later don't feel well; don't eat it again.""

246,246,Diltiazem+hypertension,"I am a 24 year old female. I've been told after having ""unexplained"" tachycardia for the last 6 years; that I have Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. Beta blockers gave me drug induced lupus symptoms; so after 5 years on one; once they figured out that it was the cause of the lupus symptoms; they took my off the beta blocker. So far; calcium channel blockers have given me intolerable side effects. I haven't been able to take them long enough to see if they work for tachycardia; due to the side effects. I've been prescribed Cardizem CD now; and we'll see how that goes. My guess is that it will do the same as the others; due to the fact that I naturally have low blood pressure. They made me dizzy; floaty feeling; visual problems; shakey; cold; SO tired; and off balance. My heartrate sits between 120 - 160+ bpm for the majority of the time. It will drop down to 80 or 90 bpm for a few seconds; and then go right back up. This is 24/7; all the time. It never stays at a normal rate. It feels as though it's always ""pounding;"" and this wakes me up in the middle of the night about 5 times every 2-3 hours while I'm sleeping. Walking 2 driveway lengths shoots my heartrate up to 150+; and it doesn't go back down at all for about 30 minutes. The worst part; even more than it being fast; is that it feels as though it's POUNDING; even when it's only 80 bpm. I saw an EP and was diagnosed off of an EKG; and listening to my heart with a stethoscope; (he heard it being high; and then drop; and then go right back up); and confirmation from another cardiologist that the ultrasound; stress test; and 24 holter moniter had revealed no structural abnormalities. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I am pretty miserable and don't want to live with this for the rest of my life. I realize that if I can't fix this; not only will I continue to be uncomfortable all the time; but I won't be able to have children either. I was born over 3 months early due to my mother's untreated tachycardia. I can't be outside when it's hot out because this increases my heart rate even more. In just regular weather when it's not hot; by the time I get to class; 2 driveway lengths from where the bus dropped me off; my heart is so fast and I'm so tired that I'm stumbling and have sit down. I can't do more than 1 floor level of stairs without having to sit down; and I can't sleep at night because my heart pounds so much that it wakes me up. Just walking 100 feet(the length of 2 driveways) at a time is the most exercise I can handle. The doctor said that surgery will not work on this; beta blockers are not an option; and so far; calcium channel blockers are a no go. I'm willing to try this next med; the cardizem CD; but most likely it will yield the same results due to my bloodpressure being low. 1) Is a pacemaker an option to stop this tachycardia? I know that I'm young; but I don't want to live with this. I'm willing to have a surgery every 7 years to not have to feel like this. 2) do I have any other options? 3) will having my heart beating this fast so often eventually damage my heart? 4) why does my heart feel like it's POUNDING; even at times when it's only 80 bpm? 5) were the test results that were gone off of to diagnosis this enough? he didn't see the 24 hour holter monitor results or the ultrasound of stress test results; just went off of the previous doctor's word that nothing was structurally wrong. the doctor I saw before the EP had said it was SA node tachycardia. The EP says it's Inappropriate Sinus Node Tachycardia. 6) Where would be the best hospital to go to/area of the US to go to; to get help with this? 7) When I was 16 I was told that I have a 2cm mass on my adrenal gland. It was never investigated despite my requests. (I've had my tachycardia for 6 years). The last 3 years; my hair has fallen out of my head by the masses. Could this tachycardia be caused by a pheochromocytoma? I know it's rare; but I do have the mass on my adrenal gland. Is hairloss related to pheochromocytoma? It falls out from the root; with the root attached; it's not breakage. It grows back to about an inch long; and those inch long pieces fall out too. I have hundreds of 1"" long pieces of my hair that stand straight up all over my head. I also sweat on my eyebrows only; even when it's cold outside; for some unknown reason; which is very odd to me. You can't see it; but if I touch my eyebrows; my fingers come away wet. I am not overweight. ***side note. My mother: mitral valve prolapse; and tachycardia.

I guess I am wondering the million dollar question...how can I keep my A-Fib episode from coming back? 2. I have heard of people having A-Fib once and it not coming back...what are the percentages on this? 3. What are the overall numbers of no A-Fib recurrence for someone cardioverted? That was what was weird about mine...I stayed in it at the hospital for about 10 hours and the meds were not converting me...is this cause for concern? 4. I have been exercising (2 miles 4xs a week); and doing yard work type stuff. I am still afraid to lift heavy objects; and play basketball or football...would any of these things increase the risk. 5. It seems like A-Fib doesn't have to effect life exp. or quality of life...thoughts? 6. I went to see a regional research center EP in mid August. He looked over my myriad tests from both March and July. He said he saw a totally healthy heart and ""zero"" reason to even do an EP study...I assume there is no reason for another opinion? 7. Docs who cardioverted me put me on 120mg of Cartia and after Coumadin for 3 weeks I am now on aspirin...does this sound about right? 8.

Wichert 801 Date Drive Pearl City; HI 96782 or e-mail me at ***@****. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my condition. I anxiously await your reply. Sincerely; Terry Wichert Doctor; I am posting this as a follow-up on 4/15/98. First let me say thank you for answering my first mail in such a professional and thorough manner. You are the first cardiologist I feel who has really listened to what I had to say and to how dibilatating my condition is. Now to the answers to your questions. I did have an echo and a cardiac MRI. Both were normal as read by one cardiologist and one other cardiologist told me I might have a slight bit of left ventricular hypertrophy (from ~ 5 years of mild hypertension); but basically I have a structurally sound heart. My EP study was in fact conducted at Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego by Dr. Ker Boyce. My EP study was done off of medications except those which were administered to me by IV during the procedure (Versed; Fentanyl;Isoproterenol). I converted to AFIB once and VFIB once during the procedure (Shocked out with 200J and 300J of energy); but never went into VTAC despite being given ISO at 10 mcg/min. I eliminated caffeine from my diet a long time ago and have never consumed alchohol or tobacco. Basically that leaves stress. There certainly seems to be a stress component to my illness. I believe your possible diagnosis of a neurohormone production disorder is definitely related to my condition. How is such a disorder treated. As I said beta-blockers have been completely ineffective on me; and in fact have made symptoms worse in most cases. The stress correlation is also validated by the fact that I have been on leave for the past two weeks and my PVCs have decreased to several hundred per day vice several thousand; however I have had 3 runs of VTAC in the last three days; one of which lasted for ~ 45 seconds. I always (at least so far) convert out on my own; and I don't appear to be too symptomatic with the VTAC other than it scares me; so there is probably and adrenalin rush associated with it.

251,251,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'll try not to write a novel here and just get to the point. I'm a healthy woman; 52 yrs. I have no other health issues; have a healthy heart (CHAD score is 0); BP that is nice and low (100/60); don't smoke; drink (anymore - it's big trigger); etc etc. After an ablation for PVCs; I developed a-fib. I have a wonderful (and high profile) cardiologist in Boston (who performed the ablation). He put me on flecainide (worked up to 75mg/day) and 50mg/day metoprolol. It worked at first - not a blip. But then I started having frightening episodes of SVT; which brought me to the ER; and eventually hospitalization. He took me off the flecainide which seemed to be the cause of the SVT. I also have atrial flutter now. I had cardioversion; but still have a-fib and my heart rate is too high again (I'm on an event monitor which reported to my doctor that my heart rate was 150 last night while I slept through it). He has put me on 100mg metoprolol - I'll be taking the 2nd dose (50mg) in a few minutes. He wanted me on the brand name Toprol XL; but the pharmacies are having a hard time stocking it right now so I'm on the regular (not extended release) version; taking it in the a.m. and again in the p.m. OK; done with the background; now here's my issue: I've been online reading page after page after page about people who have taken this and the side effects at this dosage that they are reporting are scaring me to tears. Everything from hair thinning to huge weight gains (I'm somewhat overweight; so this is the last thing I need); sleeplessness; extreme exhaustion; depression; sweating; zero libido; worsened a-fib - it just goes on and on. Honestly; I'm so upset and frightened. I just knew I shouldn't have gone online and read this stuff; but now that I have I'm shocked at how prevalent these adverse side effects are. I feel like I'm going to become a chronically unhealthy person and this is the beginning of the end of my healthy years. Oh; one of the things I read was that it is impossible to lose weight while on metoprolol because it slows the heart and you are unable to burn fat - even with tons of working out. This stinks; because as soon as the monitor comes off; I was planning to start working out again to lose some of this excess weight. ...I went to the ER with a heart rate of 200+ and my BP was still perfect. I was told that this is kind of phenomenal; that my heart muscle is obviously very strong. I'd like to keep it this way. ...Any thoughts?,2007,2009,52,Female,,,['100/60'],[52],I try write novel get point I healthy woman 52 yrs I health issues healthy heart CHAD score 0 BP nice low 100 60 smoke drink anymore big trigger etc etc After ablation PVCs I developed fib I wonderful high profile cardiologist Boston performed ablation He put flecainide worked 75mg day 50mg day metoprolol It worked first blip But I started frightening episodes SVT brought ER eventually hospitalization He took flecainide seemed cause SVT I also atrial flutter I cardioversion still fib heart rate high I event monitor reported doctor heart rate 150 last night I slept He put 100mg metoprolol I taking 2nd dose 50mg minutes He wanted brand name Toprol XL pharmacies hard time stocking right I regular extended release version taking p OK done background issue I online reading page page page people taken side effects dosage reporting scaring tears Everything hair thinning huge weight gains I somewhat overweight last thing I need sleeplessness extreme exhaustion depression sweating zero libido worsened fib goes Honestly I upset frightened I knew I gone online read stuff I I shocked prevalent adverse side effects I feel like I going become chronically unhealthy person beginning end healthy years Oh one things I read impossible lose weight metoprolol slows heart unable burn fat even tons working This stinks soon monitor comes I planning start working lose excess weight I went ER heart rate 200 BP still perfect I told kind phenomenal heart muscle obviously strong I like keep way Any thoughts,I tri write novel get point I healthi woman 52 yr I health issu healthi heart chad score 0 BP nice low 100 60 smoke drink anymor big trigger etc etc after ablat pvc I develop fib I wonder high profil cardiologist boston perform ablat He put flecainid work 75mg day 50mg day metoprolol It work first blip but I start frighten episod svt brought ER eventu hospit He took flecainid seem caus svt I also atrial flutter I cardiovers still fib heart rate high I event monitor report doctor heart rate 150 last night I slept He put 100mg metoprolol I take 2nd dose 50mg minut He want brand name toprol XL pharmaci hard time stock right I regular extend releas version take p OK done background issu I onlin read page page page peopl taken side effect dosag report scare tear everyth hair thin huge weight gain I somewhat overweight last thing I need sleepless extrem exhaust depress sweat zero libido worsen fib goe honestli I upset frighten I knew I gone onlin read stuff I I shock preval advers side effect I feel like I go becom chronic unhealthi person begin end healthi year Oh one thing I read imposs lose weight metoprolol slow heart unabl burn fat even ton work thi stink soon monitor come I plan start work lose excess weight I went ER heart rate 200 BP still perfect I told kind phenomen heart muscl obvious strong I like keep way ani thought,2,3,1,"[""Sleepless"", ""Exhaustion""]","[""Premature ventricular contractions"", ""Supraventricular tachycardia"", ""Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy""]","[""Depression""]"
252,252,Diltiazem+hypertension,I'm a 46 yr old fem. fit & in good health; B/P 110/70. In June '02; I got sick with an illness which had the major symptom of orthostatic hypotension & other organ symptoms. After 1 wk I could only crawl on my hands/knees due to fainting/weakness.I was sent to Stanford Med Ctr for 10 days.Had an echocardiogram; blood tests; tilt table testing; etc.I was on IV only for 10 days.Their diag: Orthostatic hypotension & gave proamitine. Proamitine made me sick & altered.They sent me home 2 days later & my GP took me off Proamitine as he thought I had a bad virus.After 9 wks I started to get better;no more cardiac symptoms;just getting my strength & life back.Then in March 03; I had tightness in my chest; squeezing in left arm.I went to the ER. B/P was 160/100 and pulse was 180.EKG showed no abnormalities.I was given an Ativan and refered to a cardiologist.I did a Holter monitor and a stress echo.Holter showed several instances of 148 BPM while showering; or just sitting and several PAC/PVC's some coming every other beat.Stress echo showed several PAC's & PVC's that lessened with exercise. After reviewing the Stress Echo/Holter;was told I have benign PVC's & PAC's and just deal with them or take beta blockers.I asked why all of a sudden I started having PAC's PVC's they said they didn't know.I asked if they would go away-they said no.Can someone tell me why these all of a sudden cropped up; and what can be done for them? I have multiple per minute and am uncomfortable. Are these as benign as they say? Organs just don't start acting up for no reason do they? What can I do?

255,255,Diltiazem+hypertension,For the past several years I have noticed that after eating food (which ranges from just a cup of milk to a full meal) that my heart rate and blood pressure increases significantly about 30 minutes after eating; and it lasts for about one and 1/2 hours to two hours. This occurs about 50% of the time after eating. My heart rate goes from ~75 bpm up to 140 bmp (max todate); and the blood pressure goes from 130/80 up to 180/102 (max to date). Note: I am borderline hypertensive and take 20mg of lisinopril a day. I have attempted to determine if there is a particular type of food; or food additive that might trigger the symptoms; and have noticed the symptoms always occur when I eat peanut butter or the snack crackers that are sold in vending machines; and will occassionally happen when I eat homemade macroni and cheese. Other that these foods; I can find no relationships. I can have a cup of milk one morning and get the symptoms; then have a cup the next day from the same gallon and have no symptoms. I have had several tests in the hospital - stress test; sonogram of the heart; gastronomic tests - with no results. Of course the tests were not conducted just after eating; so I was not exhibiting the symptoms.

256,256,Diltiazem+hypertension,I suffer from severe anxiety from PVC's (which I have had for years and you would think that I would be getting used to them). I have tried Buspar (which gave me headaches); and tried Paxil (which made my PVC's worse). I have also tried Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel blockers but they didn't seem to help much either. Beta Blockers gave me terrible headaches as well. I think it is because I have naturally low blood pressure anyways. Doctors here say don't worry about palpitations; but it is too late; I am terrified of them. No amount of pacifying from EP doctors or my family physican will make me stop worrying. I would like to know if you can recommend any anti-anxiety meds that a person could go which would not affect the heart in any way. Is it normal to have such severe anxiety that I actually avoid any situation that I have to be around people now (because my my fear of my heart skipping). I also cannot sleep at night at all because I feel my heart skip sometimes every third beat or so and it sends me into panic. I have constant butterflies in my stomach because I can't stand the feeling of the PVC's. These darn things have taken complete control of my life. My doctor is a a loss as to what to do with me.

259,259,Diltiazem+hypertension,Hello Everyone - I am a 34 year old female who was diagnosed about 8 months ago with hypothyroidism. Additional testing then diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. My initial TSH level was 12.7; so I was I placed on 50 mcg of Levothyroxine. My TSH level is now 4.8. I have had all of the normal hypothyroid symptoms - weight gain; muscle pain; tiredness; etc.; but my biggest complaint (that doesn't fit symptoms of hypo) is heart palpitations. At their worst; I was having them for sometimes 5 - 6 hours a day. I did see a cardiologist; who did an EKG; echocardiogram; and also had me a wear an 24-hour heart monitor. After reviewing all of the tests; the cardiologist said that I had a perfectly healthy heart; and that the palpitations were most likely a result of hypothyroidism. For the first few months after being on the Levothyroxine; I can honestly say that I did NOT feel any better. However; over the past 6 - 8 weeks; I have begun to feel more like my old self again. FINALLY; the palpitations started to subside - occurring for only 3 - 4 hours a day; then about 1 hour a day; then only a few flutters here and there. I was absolutely elated to have them gone! Within the past week however; as soon as I woke up in the morning; I could tell I just didn't feel right. I've been having more palpitations again (an episode last night lasted for about 2 hours). It's only been a few days since the palpitations have returned; but I am scared to death that I am going to have to start dealing with them again. They make me feel awful! I promised myself I was going to keep this as concise as possible; and looking at the above I appear to have failed.

I can't even really find a correlation between caffeine/alcohol and them (although I never consume anything caffeinated). I exercise regularly. And I never experience them when exercising. However; when I do get the PVCs; they come every other beat or almost every other beat non-stop for hours. This bigeminy and trigeminy always occurs in the evening; sometime around 7 or 8 as I'm settling down from dinner and a trip to the gym. As I let my mind and body relax; the PVCs get more frequent and eventually as I lay down to get to sleep the PVCs occur at nearly every other beat. Lately; I haven't been able to take this at night; so I will jump out of bed and furiously pump out about 50 push-ups without stopping. This gets my heart rate up quite a bit; maybe around 80 or 90 bpm. The PVCs are totally gone in what I understand is called ""overdrive suppression"". This works every time and sometimes if I'm lucky; will keep the PVCs at bay just long enough for me to fall asleep. What is really interesting; is that the PVCs don't wake me up; and I'm not even sure they are occurring when I'm unconscious. I have woken up early in the morning before my alarm clock goes off; or even in the middle of the night now and then and have not felt one PVC. It seems that once I'm unconscious; these are also suppressed; or I'm just super relaxed and the heart pumps without anything irritating it to cause a PVC. Two questions: 1) Has anyone experienced or is experiencing anything like this at all? 2) These facts are always true; and the PVCs are not that random. Don't these symptoms point to a clear cause?? My PVCs occur at slower heart rates so Beta Blockers don't work. And ablation seems extreme still. No other solutions? Thanks in advance for any insights!

261,261,Diltiazem+hypertension,"Hi all. I had an ablation 4 weeks ago and since that time I have been experiencing chest tightness; pressure; and sharp pains in the heart. I am seeing my doctor on a weekly basis to determine the cause and undergo treatment. Following a work up of tests (echo; nuclear stress; ekg; etc.) the doctor has determined that everything in the heart is normal and that this ""discomfort may be something that I just have to ride out."" I never experienced these problems before the procedure and had an ablation due to SVT. My question is - has anyone had similar experiences following an ablation procedure? If so what were your symptoms; how long did the discomfort last; and what type of treatment did you undergo? I am a helthy 29 year old that had been exercising regularly before the procedure. Since then I have not been able to do so because of the pain. I just want to feel ""normal"" again.

262,262,Diltiazem+hypertension,Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?,2006,2006,,,,,[],"[3, 12, 3]",Over week ago absolutely identifiable reason heart started skipping way beats usual I go hours none several hours I 2 3 minute It setting edge I know dangerous I went ER day basically care take Ativan sent home Today I panicked called paramedics came 12 lead said normal sinus one ectopic I go back ER I normal echo 3 years ago I already eat caffeine sugar Please reassure sympathize I going insane idea causing blue Why would suddenly increase reason whatsoever,over week ago absolut identifi reason heart start skip way beat usual I go hour none sever hour I 2 3 minut It set edg I know danger I went ER day basic care take ativan sent home today I panick call paramed came 12 lead said normal sinu one ectop I go back ER I normal echo 3 year ago I alreadi eat caffein sugar pleas reassur sympath I go insan idea caus blue whi would suddenli increas reason whatsoev,0,0,1,[],[],"[""Caffeine related disorders""]"
