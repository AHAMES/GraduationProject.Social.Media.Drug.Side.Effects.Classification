Metformin+diabetes+type+2	This is really a post for a friend of mine. He has had Type II diabetes for years but is finding very hard to control as his Metformin AS 500mg makes him sick every day.He takes it in the morning just before breakfast and is nauseous the rest for the day. As such he skips taking it most of the time with his glucose in the 300's and even when he does take it his glucose is in the high 200's. He is wondering if any other diabetics have had this problem with the metformin? Dennis	2008	2011		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	hi i am neethu;my mom has type 2 diabetes since 1 yr and age is 43 yrs; First time we consulted 1 doctor he gave some tablets but my moms sugar level was around 220-230 range and later due to his selfish nature to gain more money has suggested insulin intake at earlier stage itself which was not needed and was harmfull; so we left that doctor and consulted other doctor and her BP is always at normal range only; empty stomach sugar test range is 160-163; and after breakfast sugar test range is 140-143; HBA1C test is 8.0; the doctor whom we are consulting now has suggested the following tablets istamet 50mg/1000mg (before breakfast); Gemer forte 2(night after dinner); Lipirose 10 (night after dinner);Axeten H (Morning after breakfast) So as said above the doctor has given 4 tablets to take per day; my doubt is 1. Why the doctor has given that many tablets to my mom when some other doctors suggest just 1 or 2 tablets for their patients having same problem?? 2. Are the tablets which that doctor suggested are good and correct for my mom? What medicines would you suggest for my moms condition so that i can ask the doctor we are consulting. Please help me as soon as possible it would be of great help to me. Thank you.	2012	2012		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 24 with type two diabetes. I am obese. I take metformin. I've been waking up before my alarm everyday with a really weird; almost hungover; dizzy feeling and I don't want to open my eyes. I get restless and have to go to the bathroom. It's always diarrhea. I then start to get sweaty; nauseous; shaky... The top of my stomach starts feeling really weird. Ill usually start getting really emotional and upset about the way I'm feeling. The thought of having to go to work in an hour makes me stress even more about it too. Worrying if ill even be able to manage standing for 5 hours.	2013	2013

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been on Byetta (stomach injections)for about 8 months. The first 6 months was the lowest dosage and now it is doubled (the highest dosage). There is no rhyme or reason concerning the A1C levels - currently 7.6%! and I have not lost any weight either - which is suppose to be a side affect (one I was looking forward to). My blood work is good for my heart disease; but not for the diabetes. I teach exercise classes but also have fibromyalgia and ostioarthritis; so exercising more would really be a chore; I've cut back on portions and have introduced more fruit and vegetables in my diet. I know if I lost at least 25lbs; I would feel better and hopefully get my A1C down. HELP - What else can I do to loose weight?	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I just realized that I haven't seen my diabetes specialist in about three years. On my last visit she ""discharged"" me to the care of my internist. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 5 years ago; at age 62. My glucose levels are stable at around 110; hB!ac 5.9. I've recently lost 25 kg; do some mild exercise and feel good. I'm taking metformin twice a day (750 mg). In addition to my internist; I'm followed by a blood pressure specialist (now weaning me of medication); a cardiologist; a gastroenterologist (weight loss program) and a neurologist (diabetic neuropathy- stable). I think I've got everything pretty well covered...but is there anything that a diabetes specialist could add to this mix? This discussion is related to Introducing the Diabetes Tracker."	2009	2009		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	After three rounds of Interferon; Ribaviron; and something else; each for 48 weeks; I am left with high fasting blood glucose and A1C of 6.0. My fasting sugars range from 134 to 160. They used to be 104 or less. I went to diabetes center for diet counseling; I walk and ride my bicycle 6 times a week; weather permitting and still may have to get pills to control this blood sugar problem. The diet modifications have not helped. I have no family history of diabetes. MCV is also out of range. I have been considered free of the Hep C virus for 2.5 years now. Had stage 3 plus liver damage with type 3 then was told it was type 1. Who knows? Any comments? Thanks. Bobbie	2016	2016	64	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	When I had a heart attack (MI) in 1992 I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic and was advised of the need to take insulin for the rest of my life.As the years went by and my insulin intake increased along with my weight but my sugar level remained fairly consistent HbA1c approx 7.2. In 2005 I decided on a life style change predominantly targeted at reducing my weight and found that I could reduce my insulin intake.Within six months I no longer needed to take insulin at all and my HbA1c went down to 6.1 and now for two years I still don't need to inject insulin or take any insulin type medication. This year I started to explore if it was possible to lower my blood sugar levels to an non diabetic level and have made progress in that direction by adding alpha lipoic acid to my daily intake and almost immediately saw by blood sugar drop and have a average reading of 5 which should mean my next HbA1c test is much lower than previously ; namely in the region of 5 . As I have been making this change my cholesterol medication has dropped from 40mg per day to 5 ; with the hope I can get off it completely and blood pressure medication reduced by 50%. I am curious to know of other peoples experience with alpha lipoic acid.	2007	2008		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 6 months ago and placed on Metformin 500mg twice a day. Within 30 days I was experiencing frequent nausea (with no vomiting). My MD thought it might be caused by Metformin so he changed to Glucotrol XL 10mg twice a day. For a few days it appeared to work; but the nausea returned and seem to get worse. I had been doing a very poor job of controling what I eat. Could my nausea be caused by high blood sugar ?	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am new here and have a question. I am 22 and have never had a period. I was diagnosed with PCOS three or four years ago. I never really thought anything of it. I was never sure if I wanted children and I had no problems with not having to deal with a period. I have moderate hirituism but I could deal with it. Recently I was in the hospital for another condition I have had since birth; everyday when they did the normal labs my blood glucose came back high. Doctors never mentioned it then and I had no clue that was the case until my sports medicine doctor at the university I attend mentioned it during my yearly sports physical. She tested my blood sugar that day and it was high again; yesterday I did the glucose tolerance test and I am waiting for the results. I am not sure if I am over reacting or if it is valid to be worried. Has anyone here been diagnosed with diabetes with PCOS? Did you know you had it/did you have symptoms or was it found with normal testing? What were the symptoms if you had them?	2010	2011	13	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed 6 years ago with Graves and treated with radioactive iodine. Seemed to do the trick and I went hypo; then treated with levrotyroxine. 6 years later I develop type 2 diabetes. Both these diseases by different doctors were treated like a cold; take these pills and call me in the morning. Another words; I was never told how to care for either. Went I went to the hospital my diabetes #'s were 1000 and my cholesterol was 1200; blood pressure 150 over 98. They recommended metformin; glipizide; lisinopril; aspirin; and cholesterol meds. Now; I have low blood sugar down to 30 by the time I treat it; hurting calves all the time and either feel nausea or crappy all the time. the Doc can't seem to get them both under control and is constantly testing while I feel like ****. I am going to see another Endo; but is there any advice out there?	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; my fasting blood sugar was 175. I am sure that these are on the higher side of the scale. My doctor adviced me to go retest after 2 weeks of exercise and strict diet control. Hence i completely changed my diet; no sugar; substantial decrease of carbs; relying on vegetables and sprouts or protein contents with additon to the 5-6 KM of walking. After two weeks when i went on re test; it was 140 on fasting. I have not used any medicine. But my question is how long i have to adopt ? is it reversible can i get back to < 100 ? BTW I am a vegetarian; 40 years old an 82Kgs in weight.	2017	2017	39	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have weened myself off Lantus Solostar insulin and have not taken it for months. I got my A1C's down from 12.2 to 6.9 in 3 months and normal BS every day. Ate healthy..

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 61 yr old woman. For about 2 years I have had type 2 adult onset diabetes. Food mangement with Metformin and Glyburide. MG. usually 80- 140. Yesterday I was sick with flu like symptoms including a fever and chills. I slept off and on for 36 hrs while getting up to eat what I could. My left foot and ankle have been swelling for about 3 yrs and more so for the last yr as I now sit more at work. This morning I got up to find my left foot; ankle and lower leg with a red rash somewhat raised; and tender. My (Dr.) is an ARNP and has been for around the last 2 yrs. I have asked her about it and the off and on tenderness in my right lower back. She told me to buy compress socks and ordered a urine test. The socks I did not buy and the test was okay. I have wondered if it has something to do with my kidneys? Probably would have shown up in routine diabetes blood tests? I am having mixed feelings about finding a Dr. that is more experienced. What do you think about my foot; leg swelling. my lower back and getting a more experienced health provider? Thanks so much.	2011	2011	60	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi there; I'm 26 and I have been diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I can't get much out of my doctor; so I wanted to ask you to tell me your experiences with this syndrome -- What are your insulin levels for instace? Mine was 3 times higher than normal when I checked it 2 years ago! How many of you have already developed diabetes? Does everyone with PCOS develop diabetes and; if so; when? At what age? I'm taking Metformin; Spironolactone and Yasmin everyday. I also have a very health diet; with roughly 120 - 140 gr carbs per day. I have a normal weight of about 55 kg at 165 cm. Even so I get hypoglycemic spells once in a while - with all the symptoms; cold sweat; blurred vision; trembling; faintness etc...And many times during the day I feel weird - I have many lows with no energy at all and again blurred vision...I almost feel the effect of every food I take in; which is horrible! I get sleepy and dizzy after eating sometimes. I know I get hypoglycemic often; I wonder if I get hyperglycemic also. Last time I checked I had normal fasting glucose levels but I know that only the tolerance test to know for sure....What's your experience with diabetes? Please advise; thank you!	2009	2009	25	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm in my early 50's and have never had blood glucose problems. I had blood work done a few months ago that was normal except for very high triglycerides. I also have asymptomatic gall stones. A few weeks ago I notice that there was an increase in the frequency of urination; I was losing weight and vision had become blurry - although not consistently. Recently my doctor found glucose in my urine and a stick test showed the level to be 270. There have been no major changes in my lifestyle. I have been less active than usual. I haven't exercised regularly in several years. What would account for this sudden and dramatic change - from normal fasting blood glucose a few months ago to a reading of 270 now? I have the metformin that was prescribed; but I would much rather be able to regulate my insulin sensitivity naturally. Any help understanding this change would be appreciated.	2008	2008	51	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes when I was Pregnant with my Twins in 2012 after having the Glucose Intolerance Test it proved I was slightly over the threshold. I was given Metformin tablets to help bring my Blood Sugars down; and was told that once the twins were born it would go.....But it could come back one day. After having the twins at my 6 weeks post natal check up I had another Glucose Intolerance test done and it showed things were within the normal range. But last year I began showing signs and symptoms of diabetes and went to my G.P who sent me for tests that came back as positive for Type 2 Diabetes. I am currently taking Metformin 500mg 2 tablets twice a day. Anyone else been through the same as me? Will I always have diabetes?? When does it become Type 1??	2015	2015		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had idiopathic angioedema attack as far back as early 1980's; it will flare up and in the past has gone dormaint for years. Now it's back and worse than ever. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about a year ago. So far the diabetes medication seems to cause the flares to be worse. I've tried metformin; actos; glipzide; and the latest one glimepiride (which seems to have by far the worst reactions thus far). Once a flare hits it last for more than 72 hours. I have had all kinds of allergy test run; nothing. I have had all kinds of blood work done. I have a high sed rate and high c-reactive proteins; high cholestrol and triglisrides; severe sleep apnea. The doctors have checked for autoimmune nothing shows. Does anyone have any information on idiopathic angioedema and diabetes combined? I am a 51 year old woman. Any ideas?	2009	2009	51	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am getting these dark red blister looking things on my right foot only. They show up several at time; usually on the sides of my foot and in the arch. They are hard and don't seem to have any fluid in them. One day it will show up and in a week it will go away and there will be lots of dry skin to peel away. Now on the right side of my right foot there is a place the size of a nickel that must have been dark red at one time and now the skin has come off. Its hard for me to get to that side of my foot due to my weight but if i stretch my leg out I can see it. Well; last night I saw that it was like a patch of dry skin and it was like a couple of layers of skin had been removed and the ""inside"" of the spot had a red tint to it; like sunburn; not like a red blister; but it is sore. It never happens on my left foot. Do you know what this might be and how I should treat it? My friends daddy had diabetes and had a sore on his foot and later in life he had to have his legs amputated. This scares me. I have a doctors appointment in about 2 weeks; and will ask him then; but was wondering if I could get some advice here until then. Thank you."	2012	2012	44	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was prediabetic 10 months ago. And I have been walking for 60-90 minutes daily and sometimes body weight exercises. Now the way I feel like tired in morning and through out the day (first day today August 30) I am concerned I might have this disorder because I started to eat sugary foods for few days in last week at night like mangoes; bananas milk; dark and milk chocolate and worst of all; I ate KFC chocolate cookie which I hate most.. If I can't sleep I start eating at night How can I reverse this I know some say its impossible. From this website and doctor say that fasting can help reverse this condition by burning off excess sugar. It does make sense. Is this legitimate. And there are certain supplements like Alpha Lipoic Acid; Chromium Pliconate; Magnesium; etc. I have NOW Magnesium Also I used like to carry groceries from shop to my car and from car to my home. I find it hard to do that as well. I don't know what should I do.	2009	2016	27	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi there- have type 2 diabetes and am doing well on metformin and lifestyle changes. Numbers are well within range now. My question is - even though my diabetes is ' under control' right now- why do I still have urgency to urinate and frequency? I thought that would be controlled as long as my diabetes is controlled. Have not had a uti since way before diagnosis.... and last month when urgency started - went for a urine test which came out clear -- they gave me cipro - which relieved it for a while- but now the urge is back. Any advice is welcome and thank you.	2010	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a Type II Diabetic. I currently take 1000mg twice daily of Metformin. Worked pretty well for me. Last week started on levothyroxine and now my blood sugar is through the roof. Anyone else have the same problems? It says I might have to alter my diabetes meds.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Im type 2 diabetic ; latest ac1 is 9.5; I was on metformin 1000 mg and glypicide 10 mg; They have now added apidra 5 to 7 units after each meal; and taken me off the glypicide. My blood sugars are usually between 200 to 300 dome times they get as high as 400 for the last year; But the sugars are always higher when i wake up after fasting which doesnt make sense to me? Also is there any risk of accelerating my type 2 diabetes by injecting insulin at this stage?	2008	2008

It only lasted three days and then stopped but my mild cramping; bloating; back pain; gas hasn't stopped and three days ago I had a very sudden on set of a runny nose and scratchy throat that is beginning to finally subside.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I've been gently bewildered on the subject of hcv and its relationship to type 2 Diabetes. I have always understood that HCV can cause 'blood sugar abnormalities'. Now that I am svr and expect to have fibrosis improvement (bx revealed 'early cirrhosis'; is there an expectation that the healing of the liver can; in itself; cause an improvement in blood sugar conditions?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello. First time posting as I've been diagnosed diabetic only 2 weeks ago. I'm a 30 year old woman; in good health with no other known medical issues; until now. I recently found out that I am diabetic but the doctors can't detemine which type. (I know they can do an antibody test but for some reason it was cancelled.) Here were/are my symptoms so I want to get opinions on type 1 or 2...extreme thirst; fever; sluggish and tired; loss of appetite; keytones in urine; KDA; A1C was 7.9%; low potassium; resting heart rate above 110; extreme vision change and vitamin d deficiency. Blood sugars were anywhere from 300's to 506 at highest point. I had flu-like sickness with a sinus infection and bronchitis earlier in December. Can a sickness cause diabetes to appear out of nowhere? This was just something that hit me out of nowhere...other than my parents being diasgnosed diabetic in their 50's and 60's. I'm on insulin for now and metformin trying to get my sugars under control. I spent a night in hospital trying to get this sorted out. I just want opinions while I wait to get into a specialist. Thanks! :-)	2016	2017		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I am not sure where to post this. I hope this is the right place. I was diagnosed as transitioning to cirrhosis in 2008. I treated over two years ago for HCV and am now cured. About 6 weeks ago I started taking Metformin for Diabetes Type 2. I was a little concerned to take it since my liver is damaged but was told the benefits outweighed the benefits. For the first couple of weeks the side effects were really bad as far as gastrointestinal disorder. I called the doctor and she said that this was normal and to give it time; I would adjust. While that calmed down a bit I continued to feel nauseated and started to have muscle cramps in my shin; rapid heart rate; feeling out a breath; etc. I looked up adverse reactions to metformin on WebMd and saw that many sx were the same as what I was experiencing. My question is this. Is it safe to take Metformin when a person has cirrhosis? I am thinking of stopping the metformin; controlling my sugar level with diet and a supplement called Nopal cactus. I have read that this supplement can help with various problems. I would really appreciate any help you can provide; Dee	2007	2014	2	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My mother is 57 years old. She was found diabetes type 2 in 2010. In 2010: Blood sugar is 7.3 mmol/L before meal and 9.8 mmol/L after meal. The doctor didn't give any medicine or treatment; just give advice to control sugar input and do some sport. In 2012: Blood sugar is 8.9 mmol/L before meal and 10.0 mmol/L after meal. The doctor gave Metformin and three pills a day. But it was not that helpful...Blood sugar is always 8.3 mmol/L before meal and 9.5 mmol/L after meal. In 2015: Still use Metformin. But blood sugar is 11.8 mmol/L before meal and 13.0 mmol/L after meal. The doctor thinks it is too high and gave Recombinant Insulin Glargine Injection and my mother does 15 unit injection every night. But blood sugar is still like 7.3~8.3 mmol/L before meal and 9-10 mmol/L after meal. Is this often to see among diabetes type 2 patients? Can some one give me any advice about how to improve my mother's condition? Sincerely thanks.	2018	2018		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am type 2 diabetes and sometimes I get the shakes and lightdeadedness and feel like i am going to pass out. When I check my blood level it is usually around 5.7 and I have had symptoms and my blood levels have been up to 7 at times. I thought that when you get the shakes etc it was because your blood levels are low. My doctor thinks that I am crazy when I tell him this.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My grandmother; 75 yrs of age; is a diabetic for past 15-20 years; taking metformin (2g daily) plus insulin (40+35). Where I am from we don't usually give a basal bolus regimen; just 70/30 in morning and evening. She also has history of IHD one year back. Recently; her renal function tests revealed a creatinine of 2.0 (178micromole/L). Her GFR according to MDRD equation is less than 30. This clearly means metformin should be stopped. However; when I stopped her metformin; she developed high blood glucose (9.7 fasting); so now I am not sure what to do? Are oral agents really needed with insulin for glucose control? And if not; how many units am I to increase her morning/evening insulin dose on each adjustment? How frequently to monitor? I myself am a doctor; so I know to always get the patient checked before any modification in treatment; but I just thought to also obtain the view of any experienced doctor over the internet as well. Any help would he appreciated.	2016	2017		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My parents are lot concerned about type 2 diabetes (cause of heredity) of my boyfriend. My parents are worried and concerned about our marriage. Looks like they are unhappy; feared about the complications; Child birth and may reject the proposal. Recently; a doctor advised my family on marrying a diabetic. She has insisted on my boyfriend developing complication in future ; may be within 10 years and he is only 22 now. Her talk was so scary that she insisted on the partners sacrifices for the diabetic and health risks and also lesser life span Because of this; my parents are not willing to go ahead in this wedding talks. I'm totally upset and worried. More than anything; I'm worried on his healthy life and future. He is not on insulin but on medication that too not heavy. Is there high risk factors in Type 2 ? I will be happy to see the posts on the positives of life. Also; I would like to know the complications; child birth; chances of child/Spouse developing diabetes; precautions; preventions and so on... Please help! My heart goes out for all the diabetes affected people. I understand the pain and life you all go through. All you are loved and Blessed Children of the Lord. My prayers will surely touch your happy and healthy life ever. Never leave your hopes. You all will surely succeed!	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was recently diagnosed the end of June of this year with Type 2 Diabetes. I am on metformin 100mg in the evening with dinner. My question is that whenever (most times) I eat; I get very sleepy. Doesn't matter if I am eating something that is basically carb free; I get to the point where I can't keep my eyes open. This is very unusual for me because I have had problems with sleep due to another medical condition for years. I lay down because I will go to sleep sitting up (and have) sleep a couple of hours and be fine. Again; this is not after eating sweets; or starches; but something I am supposed to eat. Anyone else have this problem? My A1C is just barely over what it is supposed to be; and my BG levels other than first thing in the morning are great. In the am they are in the high 120'/low 130's. Anyone else have this and what can be done to help it? Time of day makes no difference.	2009	2009	51	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed June 5; 2007. My eyes were always very good until 2003 i started needing glasses and forever they pretty much stayed as bad as they have been til i was diagnosed. My doc sent me to get my eyes checked when i was diagnosed; doc told me no blood vessels popped but needed major correction. I never got glasses so now more then a year later my eyes are really bad; seems every month for sure they are getting worse. I use to have trouble reading far; like a billboard with small letters. But now even seeing 3 feet in front of me looking at the calendar across my desk is where squinting wont even let me read it. My sugar has been out of control for past 2-3 months because i just havent had a chance to get to the doc.. last time i went my A1c was 7.5 from 8.1 so it went down but i know its gone back up because during the last month i've gotten 300-400's and thats with taking 1000mg of metformin twice daily; 45mg actos once daily and taking 12units of Lantus in the Morning and 8 at night. My doctor gave me humalog for fast acting but its not in the pen form like Lantus; and i dont have access to a fridge everytime im gonna eat. so i never do it. I wanna ask him for the Humalog pen i've even printed out a free trial coupon to go with the prescription. But im scared to go because i know he'll be upset i didnt go sooner. SO i got 2 questions. #1: Do you think i could have Type 1 instead of Type 2 cause how could i progress so fast in not even 2 years yet; going from great control with just the metformin to poor control with so much; i've heard type 2s go to insulin but over 20 years not 2. And im only 22 and weigh 176; i've lost 20 pounds since diagnosed. So shouldnt i be needing less insulin not more if im a true type 2? #2: Could my eyes go this bad this fast from my sugar; am i looking at blindness at a young age? Sorry for rambling..	2008	2009	22	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Now a dx of Diabetic Type II has been made based on a 3-hour Glucose Tolerance Test. Told that Dr a year ago there was more going on that merely Thyroid and Perimenopause. Was I ever right! Turns out that in an overview of regular blood tests; I don't indicate any problems. Because of that; he turly believed nothing would be found abnormal. Fasting blood glucose is still in the Normal range despite it takes 3 hours on the GTT for my glucose to get back to a normal level. Fasting Glucose - 100 1 Hour - 204 2 Hour - 181 3 Hour - 125 So now it's Diabetes; Hypothyroid and Fibromyalgia Any thoughts to be shared are appreciated. This is all new to me! Sal	2009	2011		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi Folks; I have prediabetes for the last 8 years or so and have been controlling with diet so far.I was doing lot of excercise and physical stuff for Initial 4 years but 4 years or so have been quite lazy and not doing much excercise due to my work routine as I work shifts and can not manage to maintain same routine everyday. As a result my A1C numbers have been going up. Last year in December my A1c was 6.5 and this year 6.1 (slight improvement but still much higher). In addition I also had low Vitamin D last and doctor asked me to take Vitamnin d regularly which I did not take seriously. Had my tests done again including Testesterone levels this time and my Sugar is high ; Vitamin D is low and Testesterone is also quite low ( 190). I am going to see my doctor next week and will discuss the options for Testesterone injection. In addition to the blood tests; I also feel some symptoms of arthritis like condition in my fingers and get tired very quickly. I would like to know what folks think on this forum with regards to my treatment options; Should I go on medication for Diabetes or just treat the low T and control the diabetes with diet alone? I am only 38 and have very active life/marriage. What does the future look for me ? How long can I go on like this and will be recover the low T or will be on meds permanently? Thanks.	2009	2017

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 23 year old female with type one diabetes. I've been diabetic since I was 3 years old. I am extremely onto health and fitness; and have been most of my life. ;As I'm sure most of other diabetics I've always struggled with weight loss. Currently I am 5'9 and 188 pounds I have probably gained about 40 pounds since I was 20 years olddue to lack of nutrition from the age of 18 to 20. I exercise five days a week I run I wait live for about an hour and a half to two hours a day. I am on the Paleo type of diet and eat around 1600 cal per day I cook all my meals to eat fresh vegetables nothing processed and a very rigorous with my diet but yet I have still been gaining weight uncontrollably. Now I know I am by no means I did not look overweight but this extra weight is just not normal for me has anyone else been having issues with losing weight and being a type one diabetic my blood sugars are and moderately decent control and I put a good amount of effort and taking care of it this weekend has been a huge burden on me I put more effort in that most people I know with eating and exercise and I'm not getting the desired results that I want it or even any type of weight loss.	2015	2015		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 66 y/o newly diagnosed diabetic. Went to hospital with chest pains and found out I was diabetic. Miraculously no damage done to eyes; feet; kidneys but discovered a heart anomaly. I started out at 254 lbs and I dieted all last year and was unsuccessful with losing weight. On Dec 5 my doctor prescribed Metformin 1500 mg at night; but I have been taking in the morning. I was extremely nauseated and had diarrhea the first two weeks; but now I'm only have nausea very occasionally and getting better. The most amazing thing (I thought) was that the weight started peeling off me 2 weeks ago. I now weigh 238 lbs. That's 16 lbs since Dec 5. I got very anxious about the weight loss and thought I had cancer and then went to the pharmacy and started research and found out it was the met that was doing it. One morning I woke up and had shed 4 lbs overnight. I generally have very little appetite - use to lick my plate and now I don't finish even the smallest meal. I do seem to crave sweets late in the evening. (Maybe I SHOULD take it in the evening! I try to drink more water and eat a lot of yougurt but I'm not on any particular diet. My blood sugars are running 120 to 150. My problem is starch. I'm sure if I had stayed on a strict diet I would have lost 20 lbs. I haven't had diabetic counseling so I've been hunting here and there trying to figure out what to eat. I will say this - I'm not severely out of breath as I was before I lost these 14 lbs. It's 27 degrees F. out right now and I'm sweating at the nape of my neck. I had to turn heat off in the house and don't feel cold at all. Has anyone else had sweating? I know I need to start exercising more and get a better diet; so I'll be working on that after the holidays. What I'm amazed at are the people I've met who have had diabetes II a long time and have never really got into trying to figure out how to eat; etc.; etc. I would not be nerveous about taking met.	2009	2009	65	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 21 years old in college; and I have had type 1 diabetes for 12 years now; and i have always eaten good; and exercised regularly; but just recently; i wanted to lose some weight; around 10 pounds; but for some reason i am finding it really hard to lose weight. I work out about 3-4 times a week. Usually i do a lot of cardio to burn the calories; so about 2 miles on the treadmill. But i still cant lose any weight.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi everyone; Thank you for taking time to address my question. I have been a diabetic for 26yrs (I am presently 29); and have tried desperately to lose weight. I have been on different types of insulin (currently prescribed Humolog and Lantis); and have tried working with nurses specifically involed with diabetic nutrition; but; it seems like an endless cycle in regards to losing substantial weight. So; I am hoping someone out there can help me. I'm looking for information on the effect of diet pills on type 1 diabetic's. Specifically; I'm thinking of trying a product called cylaris. If anyone can give me any type of information; good or bad; or otherwise; I would truly appreciate it. Thanks again! Regards; Mississaugaguy	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 49 year old woman. I was diagnosed w type 2 diabetes two years ago. Since that time I have been taking metformin 500x3per day w 'permission' to take a 4th if a social situation should require further food intake. I am VERY careful what I eat; and I exercise and get enough sleep and try to take good care of myself. I have a new doctor who ran all his own tests. I also have Hashis hypothyroid. My thyroid #s came back high so I have to lower them asap. But what has me concerned is that after seeing the HA1C result {0.054 (range 0.043-0.060) - dr is saying that he does not think I have diabetes at all; and he wants to withdraw the Metformin. (I am in Canada if that makes a dif in reults). My question is - isn't my A1C good BECAUSE I take the Metformin? I mean; isn't that what its for - to get back within range with blood sugars? Does this result say to YOU that I do not have diabetes after all? What will happen to me if he withdraws the Metformin? I should say that along w other risk factors; my family runs rampant w diabetes both Type 1 and Type 2 & there are members who have lost toes and limbs to it. I had gestational diabetes w both pregnancies & I also have high BP. My chol & triclycerides are good. If he withdraws the Metformin will my blood sugars go way up real quick? what will happen to me? Is he doing the right thing in taking me off Metformin? What are my risks if he does? What arguments might I present in favour of staying on Metformin? What risks are there if I take Metformin & DON'T need it? So confused! Thanks!	2002	2003

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My Doctor put me on Metformin for ""borderline Type 2 Diabetes"" (my blood sugar count is 6.5). About 3 months ago; he started me on one 500MG at bedtime. My blood sugar count remained the same; so a month ago he doubled the dosage to 1000MG (once during the day and at bedtime). However; I am not experiencing any weight loss; but I am experiencing hair loss. Every morning I brush out lots of hair and the texture of my hair has changed. I have stopped shampooing every day and just water rinse my hair every other day; but the hair loss continues. Has anyone had hair loss while on Metformin? Is there a connection between Metformin and hair loss? If it isn't lowering my blood sugar and is causing me to lose my hair--then I am considering discontinuing the Metformin.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My testosterone level and triglycerides level are high. The doctor ordered glucose tolerance test and sure enough the results came back that I have insulin resistance. The doctor then put me on Metformin. I have been on Metformin for almost a year now and my dose was increased from 500mg to 1000mg a day. I am have several dry skin; my hair keeps falling off; and diarrhea. But one thing I don't understand is that since I have been on Metformin for so long; it does keep sort of regulate my period every month. But my testosterone and triglycerides are still high. Now; I have to deal with this sort of kidney pain and back pain everyday. Does anyone out there just like me? I am also hypothyroid. I am on Synthoid; Metformin and Lovaza (basic Omega-3 acid to help lower triglycerides.) If the medication does not lower my level; should I ask the doctor to look at other underlining causes?	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello Doctor; How do you distinguish between Type I and Type II ? I am a 48 year old male of Asian -Indian ancestry. I was diagnosed in my early 20s but had symptoms (increased thirst & urination ) since my late teens. Before diagnosis I may have been overweight but not obese (BMI 26) . when I started taking medication for my condition; it was one month of pills followed by insulin (aged 29). I now take 135 units of insulin every day & other medications (lissinopril; metaprolol; lipitor; Syntheroid & aspirin) for heart & thyroid related problems. I am still not sure what type I have but since i have high cholesterol & hypertension as well so I guess I may be Type II My question to you is if I am Type II then would adding metformin to my medications reduce the amount of insuln I have to take ? Thanks.	2007	2007	46	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have recently been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I just started taking the metformin and after three weeks have run into a problem. I am not sure whether I have a stomach virus; a reaction to increasing the metformin (1000mg to 1500mg) or if it was the ice cream I had but I can't stop going to the bathroom. The diarreha has been excrutiating. Any suggestions; other than I probably shouldn't have had the ice cream to begin with. Thanks from a newbie.	2007	2009		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 26yo and have tried clomid (up to 150 mg) and it was not successful in producing ovulation. I have never been diagnosed with PCOS. I went today to see the RE for the first time. I have always had irregular periods. He gave me the option of trying metformin for a couple of months. Has anyone had any success (ie: it unduced ovualtion and/or got you pregnant) with metformin? How long did you have to take it? Were the side effects bad? Should it be taken in conjunction with clomid (he did not say anything about taking it with clomid)? He also gave me the option of skipping the metformin and going straight to injections (however they will not be covered by insurance). What should I do? I would love some advice!	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with Type 2 last year. I moved to rural Pennsylvania and do not have access to a diabetes specialist or center and I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out what I can eat. I only drink diet soda; milk; tomato juice and tea and have cut out cake; ice cream; candy; etc. I eat low sugar cookies when I need something sweet. I'm at a loss as to what to eat for breakfast. My cholesterol is high so eggs are out; bagels; cereal; pancakes and french toast also push my blood sugar over 200. What's left? I've read where I can have potatoes; peas or corn with dinner but my nurse practitioner says no. Is there any web site that has a simple to understand list of what is O.K. and what is not? I'm taking 850 mg of Metformin once a day in addition to Lipitor and blood pressure meds.	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Sadly I have been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes; they've put me on metformin which is making me feel quite ill. I'm glad they caught it; but disappointed as it means I will not have the normal birth I was hoping for. I was really hoping for a water birth; but they will now most likely induce me early so I give birth to 'normal' sized baby. They are sending me for a growth scan at 36 weeks where they will make the decision on whether they will induce me early or book me in for a c-section. Has anyone else had this?	2010	2012	29	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi...I have been diagnosed with Type II diabetes . Fasting Blood sugar 2 weeks ago; taken by general doctor; was at 470.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Recently diagnosed with Type 2. Doctor started me on Metformin (Glumetza) about a one week ago. 500MG 2x day. I'm getting some nausea that seems to continue all day and just sort of a general light headed feeling. Not dizzy per se and haven't vomited yet but it's disconcerting and not good for someone who needs to spend time outside in the sun etc. I'm just not feeling right. I'm taking it after I eat in the morning and evening and I'm really make an effort to stay hydrated. The doctor indicated this will go away after I get used to it and he said that Glumentza was actually better for his as it's extended release. But wondering if anyone else had the same problem and what your experience and suggestions are? Many Thanks.	2015	2015		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am on 4 metformin a day; 500 mg x 4. My doctor at first said take one with each meal and so eat four small meals a day. The bottle from the pharmacy says take two twice a day; no one seems to really care how I take em when I ask about this. Sometimes I seem to get metformin that are coated and sometimes they are not; have bin given three or four different brands over time and seems to be whats on the menu when I order my prescription; who knows what brand it will be next. What is better? the coated ones or non coated; is there a difference in how they work; ie; time release vs instant absorbtion and therefore a certain way to take em? Should I take two in am and two in afternoon for the day to help my blood or one per meal during the whole day? Reason I am asking is I went to a group cook-out and it was Kentucky fried chicken and lots of fresh veggies; I decided to do the right thing and ate the veggies and got sick possibly because the handler might have done something wrong where the chicken was done at the kentucky place and maybe woulda bin better luck for me; Anyway; we ate around 1 pm and around 10 pm i got sick and tossed my lunch and at the end of a violent two hour session of throwing up I could taste a chemical fishy taste and burning in my throat and back of mouth and sure enough; up came two half dissolved metformin; Why was it not absorbed and are they not supposed to be gone through the system by that length of time? I have heard about metformin causing people a bad taste and odor of fish but I never noticed it till this event with this brand and now when I open the bottle it nearly makes me sick to smell it; plus a very bad memory of that night hits me too. I hope a doctor can give me good advice on this cos I dont seem to get an answer around here from my diabetic team. This discussion is related to Drug interactions.	2010	2010	46	Female

I am type II diabetic and take Janumet. I think I remember reading in the side effects; warnings and uses pamphlet that there were some tests; proceedures and surgeries which you shouldn't have while on the medication. How long should I be off the medication before and after the MRI? Are there any other things I should consider before the test? Also; when Dr's ask about vision problems; changes and such what type of things do they mean?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My daughter has had diabetes for 10 years and has experienced significant weight gain. She has tried over the years to lose with diet and exercise but to no avail. She has recently done Weight Watchers for one month and followed it religiously. She lost practically no weight. She also exercise at least five times a week for an hour and a half. She is very frustrated and I don't have any answers. Unfortunately; her doctors over the years don't seem to be able to help. Should we be looking at type of insulin? She presently talkes Lantus and Humalog. Does high protein help? Her weight is in her back across her shoulders; in her middle and thighs. She usually injects in her stomach and sometimes her thighs. Does site matter? Any suggestions would be so appreciated. Thank you.	2004	2004

My blood glucose level has been stablized and between safe range; 70 to 85 for fasting test and 80 to 120 at 2 hours after meal. I believe the improvement in blood sugar is because of exercise and diet rather than medication. My question is: should I stop taking Metformin 500 mg?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just wanted to let everyone know that at least for me Metformin really works for losing weight! I started at 206 lbs in the beginning of May & I've lost 28 lbs to date; 178 lbs now. I was never officially diagnosed w/pcos but the doc suspected it & prescribed Metformin. It has also helped with making my period more regular. I'm about to start exercising so hopefully the weight will really fall off soon!

Last week I went to the lab for tests and all those problems are alot better than they were in Nov. However; the thyroid tests came back not so good.

I had blood work done this week and it showed improvement in all those areas. BUT the thyroid tests were: T4 .99 TSH 5.531 and TPO 912 What does all this mean? Is it hypothyroidism or hashimotos?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	3 months ago my Dr. put me on 500 mg Metformin. These last three months; I have worked very hard to cut carbs and loose weight. Well; I went back today; and my A1C is the same value; 6.7. I lost 9 pounds (I am still chubby at 5'4'' and 165 lb); my lipid panels had improved quite a bit (from total Cholesterol of 260 to 217) and I feel so much better than before. I am discouraged though. My Dr. says that this is just fine; as long as my A1C is under 7.0. But; somehow I was hoping that I could recover from this if I worked hard enough. I know that I can improve my health with more exercise; more weight loss. My carb intake is low (typical day would be around 350 cal of bread group type carbs; I don't count vegies or milks). I could also lower my saturated fat intake. But; I don't understand why my A1C remained the same. Does this mean that if I didn't take Metformin that it would have gotten drastically worse?	2013	2013		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My 15 year old son's doctor confirmed my son had diabetes yesterday. I'm waiting for a consult with an endocrinologist however the pediatrician was confused about my son's diabetes and I am too. Here's the issue. HUGE family history of Type II diabetes. My son is a tall (5'10""); slender (128lbs); athletic boy. He has recently been having symptoms of dizziness and fatigue (which we chalked up to all-night video game playing); eats and drinks like a horse (he's grown 6"" this year); no excessive urination; and is gaining weight (8lbs in 2 months). He doesn't really fit the text-book profile of Type II (his age and he's so young and slender) or Type I (gaining 8lbs in 2 months). How do doctors determine if a teenager has Type I or Type II diabetes? As a side note; his blood sugar (checked on two different meters to ensure the readings weren't off) has bounced between 68 and 266 over the past few days. Even though he's really limited carbs today he bounced up to 185 after water; salisbury steak; and an orange at school. The doctor suggested this could be rapid onset of diabetes that we caught very early and his A1C today of 4.9 confirms that may be the case. Thank you; I appreciate the advice. I can manage my diabetes fine and my son is taking all of this in stride along with the diet change and hourly glucose readings (the pediatrician asked him to log them for the endocrinologist) but we're confused if he's headed towards insulin or metformin."	2006	2006	39	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had Type 2 diabetes since October 07. I was put on Amaryl then and now am also on Metformin. I have since gained almost 5-8 pounds. Is this normal? I can't find this listed as a side effect in the drug info. I am about 20 pounds overweight and have been trying to lose that to help with the diabetes. I have a healthy diet and try to exercise as much as I can. I also have Crohn's disease (which may have contributed to the onset of diabetes); so heavy exercise is out for me. I am young and rather active; but have a bad family history with diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases. Sometimes I feel like no matter what I do my genetics always win. Just wondering if I am alone here or if others have the same problems.	2008	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I have told many times in the past that I am pre diabetic as my fasting blood sugars run anywhere from 107 to 118 when cked every three months. Then in January she started testing A1c levels also and said they were high (6.1; and then 6.3. but this last time my fasting level was 118 and my a1c came back 6.5. She said now I was diabetic and put me on Metformin 500 xr once a day and told me to lose weight. I forgot to mention she was concerned I gained 16 lbs within same time period (even with change of diet and exercise). I am also Hypothyroid and on Levothyroxine 115 mg. I have 2 questions; If I take Metformin with evening meal and thyroid in am is there still a chance for interaction? Is there a good diet that works for people who have somewhat high blood sugar level but not at extremes that will help me lose weight. Sorry for the book; but am really concerned as I am a single mom with a 15 yr old still to raise and I must be able to keep working to support both of us.	2009	2010	46	Female

My sugars have always been higher in the morning (fasting) than any other time of day; but lately these fasting BS are even higher. I have been reading about dawn syndrome on the ""net"" and think that might be what is going on. However; I have not come across much in the way of specific management plans.

I recently have been struggling in terms of my ketone levels jumping up the the Moderate level while have my sugar being stuck between 160-250; I typically had had my sugar go down as far as 80-90; but now it never seems to go down; even if I dont eat or do anything. I am 25 and very confused. I also have binge drank a bit over the past weekend. I wonder if that is connected? I currently do not take any drugs; I am holistic.	2009	2014	25	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am not sure if i am a type I or Type II diabetic. I am 53 yrs old and have had diabetes for 8 years. When I was first diagnosed they said it was type II and gave me oral meds. They did nothing. I finally went to the Joslin Clinic in Boston and they immediately put me on insulin which i have been on since. I always thought because of my age I was Type II but then I read somewhere if i was taking insulin I was a type I. I am so confused. Can anyone help?	2008	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	The doctor has prescribed Losartan Potassium 100mg; Metoprolol Tartrate 100mg & Amlodipine Besylate 10mg all together; are all these three really needed ? There is a lot of pain in the legs; weakness & headaches since the doctor added Losartan on the list.. My dad is also taking Diabetic medication: Metformin HCL 500mg & Glyburide 5mg? Some of which were replaced for hypertension and type 2 diabetes and the usage of taking these medicines are not working the way the doctor has suggested. He is overweight so what kind of foods or nutrition plan should he follow to stay healthy with consuming so much of the various drug prescriptions.	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I know this sounds strange but where do you begin. I was diagnosis with type II diabetes fall of 2007 after I was admitted in the hopsital for chest pain. I was also put on lopresser 25mg PO BID and norvasc 5mg PO QID. The hospital didn't realize my sugar was up in the hopsital but my family doctor seen my lab results from when I was in the hospital. She started me on metformin 500mg PO BID due to my A1C being 7. I didn't like how it made me feel but continued to take it. Summer of 2008 I had surgery and my sugars dropped so I stopped taking the metformin. Advised my doctor and she left me do it as long as I would follow a diet and exercise. The only problem is she gives me this paper about carbs; calories; fat and doesn't explain it to me. Never told me to check my sugars even when she put me on metfromin. I asked my place of employment for a meter and only test once in a while due to the expense of test strips and lancets. I don't feel well; I'm always tired and seem to pick up every thing that goes around in the community. This is the second time I'm fighting an upper resp infection and it's been over a week. My family doctor put me on bactrim for it but still not feeling good. I know I need to get on track with my diabetes but don't know where to start. My doctor only wants to give me pills and pamphets. I wish someone could help me learn how to be a diabetic. I'm not sure if you know what I mean?	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I'm new to this forum; but thought I'd ask a couple of questions. I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with Type 2 Diabetes (I'm 33); and I've never really been under good control. I have been prescribed Metformin; but it always makes me so sick (Low Blood Sugar feeling as well as diarrhea) so inevitably I stop taking it. My first question is; does anyone know how long it typically takes for these side effects to subside? I want to keep taking the medication; but it's so hard when it makes me feel so sick. My second question is that recently I've noticed that my 5th toe (pinky toe) on my left foot won't move. I try to move it but can't. This understandably has me quite worried; and obviously I want to get my BS down; but with the Metformin making me so sick; I feel like it's impossible. Does anyone know what might be causing this problem with my toe? Thanks so much.	2011	2011	32	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello all. I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 moths ago. All my labs tests were normal except diabetes. I had pain under armpits on chest and thighs n groin area. My internist told me its muscular neuropathy caused by diabetes. Put me on citalopram and painkillers. My 2HR glucose was 117 and after 2hrs 170 .generally my sugar level is higher above 150 at random. I still have under arm pain and thighs pain though it has lessened now. But when it returns ;I feel bouts of anxiety and stress. I'm not on diabetes treatment. I believe I had diabetes since long. I have lipomas; when they form I'm in extreme pain. Can Neuropathy be caused by sugar levels like mine?	2013	2014		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My sister is schizoaffective/bipolar and now had type 2 diabeties from the antipsychotics she has taken over the years. She is 42 years old and keeps landing back in the hospital with psychotic symptoms. There have been times in her life where she has functioned quite well and even worked part-time. Now; she can not take Lithium any more because she gets into toxic levels (due to the diabetes-the kidney's can't brake doen the Lithium) and whe has tried every medicine under the sun. She is currently on 2mg of Risperdol b.i.d. 400 mg. Serequel at night; .05 kolonopin b.i.d; for diabetes; 1000 mg Metformin; b.i.d.; Zocar; Glipzide and Aticand (need to get dosage on those.)

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed as T2 about 2 years ago and began controlling by diet. Every 2-4 months; the disease has worsened and each time we change or increase the meds. I am 55. At the next increase; I am nearing the limit of metformin dosage and the last dosage implementation lasted only 70 days. I am not and never have been obese; have 100/60 blood pressure; exercise 5 days a week (for the last 10 years) and have healthy cholesterol levels. I have a number of food allergies and control my diet very stringently. No history of T1 or T2 in my family. I had my Dr. test for antibodies about a year ago and all were negative. So; why is my diabetes worsening against this evidence?! I expect to start insulin in less than 12 months at this rate. Any thoughts; explainations; similar experiences or wise medical observations would be greatly valued.	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I kind of have a handful of question.. I am T2. diagnosed jan. 2014 I have gotten off insulin and now am down to 3pills - metformin a day soon to be 2! :) my husband and I are talking about having a child. I have ben doing all kinds or research but I cant seem to find any answers to theses questions hope some one here can help me;.... has anyone (preferably females) with t2. had any kids? (I know some one some where has!) do you have to go back to shots? if I can get off the meds altogether before getting pregnant; then will I have to start them again when I get pregnant? is it possible to have a vaginal delivery? will my child be born with diabetes? I know it is likely that they will at some point get diabetes; I wonder if it will be from birth or a very young age? is metformin safe to take during pregnancy? is it possible to keep your numbers under control during pregnancy? is there anything you couldn't find online or that no one told you abut t2 and pregnancy that you wish you knew before you got pregnant? if so please do share! thank you for all your help; tips and advice!! thank you! :)	2014	2014	27	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My son; 18; has just been diagnosed with having Mild Diabetes; with A1C of 6.3; and daily glucose readings 70s through 80s. The doc has prescribed Metformin. My son is not overweight; and has always been very health-conscious; so we are stumped by this finding. Is there anything else that can mimic diabetes? We are trying to figure if it would be possible for him to get on a rigorous exercise program; along with meticulous dietary regimen; and if that will make a difference. It is just so weird because he does not manifest the typical signs and symptoms of diabetes; except for the findings of these tests. My husband does have diabetes type 2 which started when he was in in forties. There is no one in the history of the family who has had diabetes at such a young age. Any thoughts?	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 55 year old; 40 pound over weight; black male that has never smoked and drinks alcohol occassionally. And; about years ago I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and perscribed 1- 10 mg tablet a day of Lipitor for treatment. I've since been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed 1 - 1000 mg tablet twice a day of Metformin for treatment. For the past several years; I've been focused on lossing weight with little results. The things that I'm doing routinely are: 1) reduced intake of processed carbs; 2) walk for 45 minutes 3 to 4 times a week coulped with a 15 minute exercise. Are there naturalistic treatments that can reverse and/or cure high cholesterol and diabetes? Can the medicines be hindering my ability to loss weight? What else should I be doing?	2013	2013

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	my husband (60) has Type II diabetes; high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are being managed very well by Lipitor; Lisenpril; Actos and Metformin. Before he was diagnosed (2004) we enjoyed Ecstasy maybe once every 1 or 2 yrs. It was an amazing experience for both of us; our relationship; our communication. As older adults we managed the experience (reliable source for E; hydration; calm location) carefully and respectfully. We'd love to do it again once or twice; but can't seem to get any information about drug interactions; so given his drugs - can you see any immediate danger? Most doctors would say don't do it based on fear or lack of knowledge; but is there anyone out there that can give us reliable; good advice based on experience?	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello...in 2008 I had a gastric bypass. I was so excited about the possiblity of being ""cured"" of my type 2 diabetes....but at no time; even during the phase where i was on all liquids and immediately after my surgery while i was in the hospital did my glucose numbers drop...they were even higher in some instances. I didn't lose that much weight either in the first phase post op. I think I may have dropped about 20 lbs the first month after my bypass. My family physician said he didn't really understand how i didn't react better to the surgery. I am 60 years old on disabilty for COPD (not dependent on O2 ) but still am limited to how I can exercise though. Has anyone had this experience? Especially because of all the news of how this could be the standard to treat diabetes reports on the evening news...i am really upset and somewhat depressed. Has anyone had the same results as myself or have an idea why i reacted this way? The best thing that happened to me is that I am on Januvia (added to Lantus; metformin regimen) thats a good thing!!"	2006	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Some background first. I am 41; Male; Indian. Vegetarian (eggs occasionally); alcohol 3-4 times a year; non-smoker; refrain from junk food; sodas & fruit juices. BMI of 22; though not athletic. I was diagnosed with Vit B12 deficiency around 2010 - level was around 96 or so. I was given 1000 mcg orally. After about 2 months the level did not rise significantly so I was asked to take injections. I delayed and took injections in early 2012. The dosage was daily for a week; weekly for a month; and monthly 2 months. The B12 level increased at that time. Now to 7 March 2014. I went for a routine health checkup (complete blood count; lipid profile; fasting blood sugar; liver function test; HBA1c; EKG); & also B12 test. B12 level came to 122 pg/ml (normal marked is 180-914). So evidently I am deficient in B12. And my symptoms of tiredness; lack of focus; disturbed sleep; etc. are back. In the Lipid profile; Total Cholesterol; Tryglycerides; HDL; VLDL and Cholesterol to HDL ratio are all within the mentioned normal range; but LDL is 116 with a normal range mentioned of “<100″. Liver function test parameters are all mentioned within normal range. But yesterday for the first time my Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) was above the normal level 133 mg/dL (normal mentioned as 70-100) with HBA1c at 6.7%. On 08-Mar I went to another lab and repeated both tests. FBS was 108 while HBA1c is still showing as 6.7%. The last time I did a health checkup was in Jan 2012. Fasting was 90 and HBA1c was 5.7%. The doctor whom I met on 07-Mar was seeing me for the first time. He has prescribed Metformin 500mg once daily; telling me that I have Type 2 Diabetes. The questions I have are: 1. Is it the B-12 deficiency & not diabetes that is causing high HBA1C? 2. Given B12 deficiency; should I start Metformin (I have read that it can cause severe B12 deficiency); or should I first try with diet control; exercise and a repeat course of B12 injections? Thanks in advance.	2008	2014		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My father has had psoriasis for the past 15 years. He uses topical steroids.( triamcinalone) Two years later he developed Diabetes type 2 ( runs in the family-his mother suffered from it.) He is on Metformin; Pioglitazone 15 mg once a day; Glyburide 10mg two times a day; Lisinopril 10mg once a day; and Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10mg/80 mgs once in the evening. Using the Glucometer at home he checks his glucose regularly but it fluctuates greatly. On days where he does strenous exercise ( yard work) it goes to 70g/dL and when he completely does not exercise it can go to 220mg/dL. But most days it's around 120mg/dL He exercises 4 days a week on the treadmill. He has a comparatively normal lunch; but a very small dinner. He drinks 2% fat milk 1 glass. He eats veggie esp. for dinner. He is very good about not eating sweets; cakes; and certain fruits. However he has a very stressful high profile job and has been living by himself for the past 5 years. He has to frequently fly. He has had central obesity since his mid 30s (and his limbs are also lean) and we first noticed that his upper back near the nape of the neck has enlarged. He has complained of problems in getting a full nights sleep and subsequently told he has sleep apnea and needs a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine at night. Now he also complains of dull aching pain near the right upper thigh. Recently he went in to the Dctors office about the controversy over the Avandia and his Pioglitazone for which he wanted changed to another appropriate drug. His doctor said that he must continue the drug and that if he stopped he would then have to move to insulin. ( That's definately not something we want.) He had his blood test done and his TSH is high. His reports as of July 2007; Result Normal LIPIDS: HDL 34ml/dL > 40 Triglycerides 185mg/dL <199 Total Cholesterol 131mg/dL LDL 60mg/dL Creatinine with GFR Kidney Creatinine 0.87mg/dL 60 mL/ min > 60 Urine MicroAlb Albumin/ creat ratio 3.3ug/mg 0.0-29.9 Muscle enzyme (CK) 49U/L 0-200 Fasting glucose 113mg/dL 60-99 Potassium 4.2mEq/L 3.5-5.3 ALT ( liver) 20U/L <36 TSH 6.4uIU/mL 0.2-5.5 HGBA1c 7.7% 4.6-6.0 Questions: 1. How is the thyroid related to this disease process? is it due to the drugs e.g ADR; interactions 2. What else should I do to better help him? 3. Is the steroids for psoriasis causing all these problems? Can I just have it apply when it gets worse? I really am very confused. I would be very indebted to you if you would answer these Qs. Thank You	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Our 38-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a few weeks ago. Of course; my husband and I are very upset and shocked since she was always extremely healthy until recently. She also has been very moody and irritable. We were hoping that starting insulin injections would help relieve the moodiness; but it seems to have continued; even though her sugar levels have been kept under control. Is this a common occurence at the beginning phases of Type 1 diabetes? We so much want to help our daughter--and to relieve our own anxiety-- but she seems not to like our asking her about her health or making any suggestions. We are also concerned about our two little grandsons. How likely are they to develop Juvenile Diabetes?Thanks so much in advance for your kindness and patience.	2004	2004		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"How do diabetics lose weight? Is it slower than normal people? I also have an autoimmune disease (mixed connective tissue disorder). I was normal weight a little over 2 years ago before getting pregnant and got gestational diabetes and gained 90 pounds while pregnant. That turned in to type II diabetes after I delivered; and I feel like I'm stuck at too high of a weight right now (just over 200 pounds at 5'5""). I have taken a little off since being on metformin; about 5 pounds in 6 weeks. Is it just going to take a while? Can my doctor recommend a weight loss medication since I have diabetes? She was reluctant to even talk about it with me and said I needed to focus on getting healthy instead of getting thinner right now; and focus on getting my autoimmune disease a little more under control. But; isn't staying fat not healthy either? My blood sugar levels are controlled well with metformin and low carb dieting. How low carb can I go? I am eating about 12 carb choices per day; with a caloric intake of around 1400 calories; with high fiber. It is hard to exercise in winter and I can't afford a gym membership with all my medication copays; plus I have a 2 year old with autism who has therapy 4 times per week plus it is just tired mommying. Is exercise essential for diabetics; or can you lose weight without the exercise? Is stress bad for diabetics? I notice when I get really really stressed; my blood sugar levels go higher quite a bit; even if I've eaten not many carbs. I realize there are a lot of questions I have. I just have not been able to ask my doctor everything because I had so many other questions for her to answer and there's only a certain amount of time they have to see you during the visit. Right now I am not seeing an endocrinologist for my diabetes; just my primary care physician and my rhumatologist."	2007	2008	107	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello everyone. I'm new to this forum. I've had diabetes type II for 4 years but only recently got the wake up call to take care of it when my blood sugars hit 300 and I was having a hard time staying awake. Up until 3 weeks ago; I was taking 750 mg of metformin ER once a day and a ridiculously high carb diet...everything that is bad for me. 3 weeks ago; I radically changed my eating. I now only eat proteins; vegetables and low sugar fruits. I drink unsweetened iced tea and water. For 2 weeks I was on 1000 mg of metformin ER per day; and for the last 3 days I've been on 1500 mg of metformin per day. I'm also taking Lantus 12 units per day. I definitely have the dawn phenomenon because my fasting blood sugars are now between 160 and 180 (used to be around 250). After I eat in the morning; it's around 150. Throughout the day it wavers between 120 and 170-180. By the time I go to bed; it's back up to the high end again; despite the low carb nature of my diet. If I do eat something that's sweeter; like a nectarine versus an apple; it really sends my blood sugar up; so I know that low carbing it is what works for me. So in spite of all the changes; my blood sugar is not yet at a normal level AND I have only lost 4 pounds. With such a dramatic lowering of my calorie intake; I am surprised that is all I've lost. So my question is 2-fold: Did you find that your new way of eating took a while to kick in terms of weight loss and evening out of your blood sugar? Did you find the same thing if you are on metformin ER and/or Lantus? Could it be that because I'm not evened out yet that my body is still making too much insulin and therefore my body is still holding on to fat? I'm confused; and I'm getting really frustrated that this is not kicking in faster. I am about to start a water aerobics class. Though I am only 41 years old; I also have MS and autoimmune arthritis with a leg that does not allow me to walk or bike; so I'm getting back into the water. I know that exercise will also help. I'm still interested in your answers to what your experience is with the above. Thanks! Jayson	2009	2009	41	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I routinely have blood sugars in the 150 range my A!C has been 7.7 and 8.2. I was suppose to have some foot surgery; but it was cancel because of the A1c. It is the 1st time I was told I couldn't have surgery because of the diabetes. My regular doctor signed off on me having surgery. The foot surgeon wouldn't do it. I just didn't think my blood sugar level was of any concern.	2008	2012	50	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I am a 40 year old male who; and have been fit and healthy until a few years ago. I started getting pains in my stomach and back (right side) and down the front of my right leg; no pressure when urinating; and feeling generally unwell (sick; dizzy). I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last year and have been on metformin for about 2 years. This has controlled the blood sugar levels but all the symptoms are still present. My doctor has taken blood and urine tests; all of which have come back clear. I have been to a urologist and had an ultrasound on my bladder and prostate and all is OK there. I now also have a perminant rash on the glands of my penis; which my doctor tells me it thrush; but no creams clear it up. I would be forever greatful if you could give me some advice to what is wrong with me.	2011	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi all. I've posted about this a few times so I'm sorry if it seems repetitive; but I have my appointment with my RE today and am trying to figure out what I should do. Once again; I have polycystic looking ovaries (which my RE claims is normal and probably good; but I don't really believe as I have long cycles; unpredicatable and 3 miscarriages at 24 years old); no insulin resistance or elevated male hormones. I am also not overweight. As long as I have no large cyst I'm going to start clomid soon; but should I push for Metformin? WIll it really decrease my chance of miscarriage? I just don't want to have another one. Does it have horrible side effects? WIll it hurt if it turns out I didn't need it at all? Also; it's a cat B and not considered totally safe for pregnancy use though I know people take it. I just need to consider the risks. Thank you!	2006	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 5 years ago. I was placed on avandamet; but was changed to metformin and avandia when they stopped manufacturing it. My blood sugar started flip-flopping and got so bad that it was dropping into the 20's and 30's. I got my gp to send me to an endocrinologist and he did a lot of test (including two seperate stimulation tests). He said my body was producing no growth hormone and no steroids. He placed me on both and I have been taking them for over a year. During this year I have gained 30 pounds; my stomach is hard as are the muscles in my shoulders. I have constant back pain and my blood sugar is once again fluctuating from the 30's to the 300's. The endocrinologist wrote down a diagnosis of Addison's disease. I have read all about it; and think it could be the answer. My problem is with the fluctuating sugar levels and weight gain and muscle tightness shouldn't another stim test be done to make sure I still need the growth hormone and steroids. I also have multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Since all of these are autoimmune diseases should my adrenal and pituitary glands be checked out? I have been to numerous specialists and it seems they all find something within their specialty; give me medicine for it and think that's it. Is there such a doctor as a diagnostician that can take everything wrong with me and tell me what is wrong? I was also diagnosed with celiac's disease and vitamin d deficiency. I am desperate to find an answer. I am worried about continuing on the growth hormone because I have heard it causes cancer to grow at an accelerated rate. I don't have cancer now; but did in 1976 *(cervical). I feel like I am dying and they will find out what is wrong with me after I'm dead. If you have any suggestions; please reply. Thanks.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm still new to diabetes type 2. Within a year as I know; my liver enzymes have elevated. My stomach has lost of contraction. I don't know it affected my heart or my heart affected other organs. Very confusing! 1. I took half a tablet of MiniDiab if I ate a little large meal or sweet food. Metformin not work at all and it makes me SOB. Now my stomach is a bit lazy (hugh bloating stomach). It didn't contract as it should be. I took the MiniDiab which it didn't work straight away. Well; after 4 hours it worked then I was shaking and floppy. I took a bar of chocolate and it still shakes. Because it shakes; dizzy and floppy then I'm panic. (I'm afraid I can't drive home) I keep taking sweets then I end up later in high sugar (after about 4 hours)! How do I adjust it? 2. I'm always dizzy (like walking inside the spaceship) Floating! The vision is blurr. I wonder is blood sugar too high or too low with this kind of symptoms? While I'm at home; I tested... Sometime it was just after meal (slightly higher). Sometime it comes while I wake up and my heart was running like a train. Sometime it comes when I was hungry. OR it got nothing to do with diabetes? 3. What is the diabetes Dr can do or should help me other than she prescribes the medications and give script to do blood tests? Thanks for looking at my post. I wasn't sure there were enough information for you to look into my case. I always can write back and provide more details if you need to.	2005	2007		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I recently was diagnosed with Type II and so I am trying to understand testing. The way I found out - the company I work for did a trial biometric screening because the insurance company is going to charge a surcharge if you fail during the real testing in the fall. My fasting result was 135 so my doctor administered an A1C test and it was 6.5% which I guess is right on the edge? Well; I have been testing every morning per doctor's instructions and it ranges from 112 to 132. Today I tested when I woke up (112); after breakfast of an English muffin and a hard boiled egg (176) then again after lunch of a turkey sandwich (198). No snacks; only water to drink. So; I am guessing I had too many carbs? Each test was 2hrs after I ate. Anyway - just looking for info about testing and what to expect. Thanx! :o)	2011	2013		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	This is the first study showing that taking insulin sensitizers (like Metformin) to decrease INSULIN RESISTANCE; increases SVR. I have waited a long; long time for this study. Now we can use this study to get doctors to test people for insulin resistance and prescribe Metformin. Success rate is about to go up.....yes!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have not been diagnosed with Diabetes. For about the past year or so; I have been a lot less active than I usually am and as a result I've put on some weight. I wouldn't consider myself very over weight; but I do need to get back into exercising and eating right; which I have started to do recently. I've been doing a little research on the signs of diabetes; but they don't seem to be very clear. I've read things like: Being more thirsty and urinating more. Also fatigue. I'm a somewhat lazy person and I feel tired sometimes; but I am being too hasty to think that this could be Diabetes? I drink a lot of water; not because I'm necessarily more thirsty; but because I like to be well hydrated; but as a result I urinate more; which would be excepted. Are there any more specific signs that I could look for? And is exercising less for roughly a year so a long enough time to develop Diabetes? Or am I simply being paranoid? Also; if I am starting to develop it; can I reverse this by starting to eat right and exercise? Sorry I can't give more description; but it seems like most of the early symptoms of Diabetes are things that most people deal with every once and awhile. Thanks.	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My wife will be seeing our doctor tomorrow (11-21-07) He's going to discuss with her starting tx. My wife is Type 1; Stage 4 and her Viral Load is over 2 million. She also has high blood pressure and diabetes. Does anyone have any advice for us? Will diabetes make tx harder for her and should she do different things during tx? I know the doctor will answer these questions; but I'm so worried about my wife; that I'd like to hear some words from people who have been there. Thank you; Joey	2007	2007	50	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi Everyone; Well my hubby has been dx'ed with diabetes. He had been having excessive thirt; URGENT urination; and had lost 12 lbs without even trying. I kinda knew what it was before we even went to the doc; so I prepared him for it. Basically; nobody likes to be dx'ed with anything; but this is not too bad. It just means that our eating habit must change for the better; I have to stop whining to go out to eat all the time for a while; and he HAS to start taking daily walks with me; as I have been begging him to do forever :) As long as he keeps his blood sugar under control; I think he'll be fine. But I do have a lot of learning to do. I did a quick search online and found a couple articles linking hep c infection to diabetes type 2; which is what my hubby has. My questions are; has anyone else been dx'ed with diabetes 2; and do you have any advice for us? And; had anyone tx'ed for hep c with diabetes? Are there any special complications? Thanks! -Dee	2007	2008	38	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello. I am a 32 year old woman that has PCOS. I was diagnosed around 11 years ago. I was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago. My Dr. put me on Actos plus Met and I started having a regular period immediatly. I was amazed to find out that after 3 months I brought my A1C test results down from 13.8 to 7.8. My Dr. was amazed at this. I have never ovulated as far as I know and my Dr. seems to think since I started having a regular period I should start ovulating any time now. Me and my husband are trying to conceive. I have been taking at home ovulation predictor tests but so far I have had no positive results. Has anyone started ovulating after taking Metformin with your PCOS? And how long did it take? Maybe I'm worrying for nothing and just haven't given it long enough. Thanks for any help.	2009	2009	32	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I went on insulin two months ago. I have early kidney disease and diabetic neuropathy. My ankles and feet are so swollen I can't find shoes. My feet and ankles sometimes hurt so bad I can't sleep or walk. I am on Lyrica for fibromyalgia and it makes the swelling worse.My blood sugar is coming down slowly with the insulin.I was put on another blood pressure pill but it made the swelling worse. I take Lisinopril and a water pill and am trying another new pill. My blood is still high. I wonder if I should go off the Lyrica? I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 40 years ago. I have lumps in all the adipose tissue on my body. They are extremely painful and I have bands of them everywhere. My hips and lower back hurt so bad I can't walk more than a few steps. Some of the lumps are so big that you can see them like on the back of my neck. If you press on me anywhere you can feel them.I think that I have Dercum's but my rheumatologist said he has never seen a case of Dercum's. I have Sjogren's and IBS and migrains. I have to drink water all the time and still feel dehydrated. I have gained 100 pounds in the last five years. It hurts so much to do anything that I don't exercise. I had to quit working and am 62 and on Social Security.I have sciatica so bad I can hardly sit upright and lots of lumps in my lower back and buttocks. Do other people with fibromyalgia have lumps? This is the one question I would love to have answered. I of course have all the pressure points associated with fibromyalgia but also I have lumps from little to as big as walnuts in all of my fat especially around my joints and rib cage.I don't feel up to working on my diabetes as I am in so much pain from the fibromyalgia or Dercum's.	2007	2007		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Does anyone know what type of reaction one is likely to get by mixing Metformin and Victoza with meds for Hep C? These are non insulin meds. I am particularly interested in the interaction with Victoza which is a good stabilizer. Both of these meds can cause some stomach distress.	2011	2011

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just wanted to continue to post and diatbetes and hep c into sunday. I have read here more then once of someone who had diabetes treated for hep c and then there diabetes cleared. sounds to good to be true although I hope it is. Does anyone have any links to share about studies in regards to diabetes and hep c. I asked by by diabetes docotor and my hep c doctor about a link between the two diseases and both said there wasn't one. Since I am not over weight and there is no diabetes in my family I am inclined to think there is a link. Also have read here more then once about those of us who crave sugar while on tx; a side effect I have been going through and giving into recently; not good for my diabetes. love to hear others on this subject	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I went in for a physical 3 weeks and found out that my A1C was 10.7! They immediately put me on metformin and I have changed my diet. I use to be a heavy drinker (like 5-10 a day) and ate very horribly. It has been about 3 weeks and I have cutout all alcohol; sugar; and white bread. I started exercising everyday and have felt so much better. I recently just tested my blood glucose levels and I'm averaging 120-130. When I first measured my blood glucose it was near 300. Has anyone been able to get of medication and how long did it take? Thanks for any advice anyone has to offer. I cannot get in to see a specialist for another month.	2017	2017		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I do not have a thyroid. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced diabetes insipidus? The reason for the test is because I have been extremely thirsty and urinating almost every 1.5 hours a day. I received a copy of the test results. They tested my ADH level (arginine vasopressin) The results are L<1.0 Range:1.0-13.3 They say there are different types of diabetes insipidus; basically that the kidneys are not doing what they are supposed to do or a pituitary issue. Has anyone experienced this or have any advice? Also; my thyroid levels are actually very good and I feel they are where they need to be. (Taking 1 grain Naturethroid and 50 mcg levothyroxine everyday) I haven't heard back from the doctor since they were just finalized yesterday. From looking this up; I may need further testing to rule out exactly what is going on? -Osmolality; elecrolytes; water deprivation test; MRI to show pituitary?	2010	2013	28	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My mother (75yrs) goes in for a bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection tomorrow morning (July 17th) ; it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently. Presently her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency?	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I JUST WENT TO A NEW ENDOCRINOLOGIST- HE WANTS ME TO GO ON GLUCOPHAGE SO I DON'T NEED MORE INSULIN AND TO PREVENT ME FROM GAINING WEIGHT.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My doctor told me I've had problems losing weight the last couple years (haven't lost any really) because of PCOS (something about polycystic ovarian something or other) and because of my diabetes and insulin resistance. I can't take stuff that would speed up my metabolism or diet pills because I also have an autoimmune disease (mixed connective tissue disorder) and the doctor is afraid it might mess up my thyroid function or something so won't prescribe any weight loss medication. Being on metformin for my diabetes I have dropped about 6 pounds in the last 6 weeks; since my blood sugar levels are more under control. That's a lot better than before. Is it just going to take a long time? So; I am if weight watchers won't take the weight off (not to mention throwing my money away every week having done that); what type of diet will work? I can't do too low carb; but I have cut the carbs way down because of the diabetes; but don't know how far to push it. So; I'm a little over 200 pounds and am 5'5"". And what kind of low impact exercise is good if you have joint issues? I am only 34; but with my health issues sometimes I feel like I'm more like 80 or 90. I gained 90 pounds being pregnant (gestational diabetes which turned in to full blown diabetes) two years ago; and before that; I was normal weight. I have been watching calories the last two years; maintaining a diet of around 1200 to 1400 calories; but the doctor said that caloric intake with the insulin resistance thing was not going to help me; it's the carbs. So; how do you do a South Beach or Zone type diet with getting enough to have energy to chase after a 2 year old with boundless energy and not pass out? Well; I guess before when I was normal weight; I was eating too many carbs and sugar heavy stuff; so I guess it's better I had a wake up call gaining 90 pounds during my pregnancy to get me to start eating healthier. And even though I am overweight; I am eating healthier now than I was 2 to 3 years ago. But; it's still depressing to be 80 pounds or so overweight."	2007	2008	107	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My height is 5;6"" and I had been maintaining my weight between 55 kg; to 59 kg for the last 10 years. Its looks to me that I am losing my fat and muscles after being on metformin and asprin which I started in November 2004. I had been on Synthroid on last 18 years and lipitor (10 mg) for last 4 years. The dose of metformin is 300mg; 1 tablet 3 times a day. Synthroid is 125 (micro-mg) 1 tablet a day. I take my Synthroid early in the morning and metmorphin after meals and lipitor in the night. It looks like for the last 3-4 months my weight has come to 55kg. I think last year my weight was 59kg. So what could be the reason for my weight loss? I walk everyday; my diet is good and healthy; my times for eating meals are very much on time; I am a strict vegetarian; milk; once a week tofu are the main sources of protiens. There are almonds; veggies; and fruits are included in my diet. Though my own business needs a lot of physical work too; but has been for 10 years. So what is the reason for my weight loss.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi - I have just found out that I am insulin resistant - I am obese; hypertensive(on Cardura 1mg and Amiloride 5 mg daily) and only have one kidney due to renal cell ca. My TC is 216; LDL 112; HDL 68 and Trig. 138; CRP 3.5; Homo 11.8. I am on folic acid 800 mcg per day. I am now exercising 1/2 hr on treadmill and starting to add some resistance training and of course watching my diet to lose weight. My PC dr started me on Lipitor 40 mg and took me off my Vivelle (ERT) patch. I am miserable - I ache all over and feel terrible. I am 54 yo; menopausal symptoms are returning - sweats; insomnia; nervousness besides the side effects of the Lipitor. I have no family history of heart disease or diabetes. Do you think it is possible to control the glucose - which runs between 100-126 and the lipids by diet and exercise alone? Are there any other options besides statins that can help? Is it absolutely necessary to do without the estrogen patch? I am concerned about my cardiac health but also quality of life. I did have a normal EKG recently and normal thallium stress test 2 yrs ago. Do you think a consult with a cardiologist is appropriate? This is my second question recently so I appreciate your help.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi forum members. I'm new to the site & hope that some of you might help enlighten me as I'm feeling pretty much alone about now. I'm 47; caucasian male; weigh around 118 kg; smoke 20 a day and 188cm. I've just found out I've got cirrohsis & about 6 months ago earlier that I have diabetes type 2 which I have under dietary control & so far so good - I've read diabetes medications are a big no no for compromised livers. I've had hcv since around 1984 I guess; making it some 25 years. I found out about the hcv around 1999 & had first treatment of rbavirin and interferon in 2000 and at that time was told after biopsy that I was a stage 2. I was a breakthrough after 48 weeks. Life went on and in 2005 I managed to get onto a Pegasys treatment (full dose - I think 800mg peginterferon and 1200mg ribavirin) at the time I weighed around 138kg. I broke through again after 12weeks and my specialist thought it best I stop to avoid any build up of immunity to the interferon therapy in case I got another chance at treatment. I tolerated both treatments pretty well. Anyway; again life went on and late last year (2008) after finding out I had type 2 diabetes (I found out as I was feeling pretty poorly - typical symptoms) my doctor noticed a low platelet count around 120 & thought I better touch base with my specialist. I did & new biopsy was ordered (more fun!). Now biobsy says cirrohsis & specialist (registrar) says lose weight (ie at least 20kg) in next three months & maybe you'll get a third treatment of peginterferon. All good & well; I think I can do the weight thing - believe me I'm motivated. What i can't work out at this stage is (and given my luck; I probably won't get the third chance & if I do I suspect I'll just breakthrough again anyway) is how much time do I have left? The registrar kind of dodged the question but said worst case scenario might be we are talking about a liver transplant in 5 years time! Does this sound about right? I've progressed from stage 2 to cirrohsis in 9 years. Is that as good as it gets or is the specialist being pessimistic? Anyway; all and any thoughts/ advice would be greatly appreciated.	2009	2009		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hope you can help.... I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. I take metformin for the diabetes and simvastatin for the cholesterol. Recently; (just the last few days); my ears have steadily grown in ""fullness"". It happens mainly at night when I lay down to sleep. Most times I just fall asleep and wake up fine. But tonight; when the fullness came on; I started feeling dizzy while laying down and that started a litlle anxiety episode and here it is 3+ hours later. So; the question is; can either of these prescriptions cause the fullness in both ears like this? Other info that might help. The weather changed here about 5 days ago from freezing and snow to just above freezing and rain. Could this just be some kind of sinus infection brought on by the change in weather? I tried holding my nostrils and mouth shut and exhaling slowly to see if it would ""pop"" the ears; yawning; I even sneezed a few times and nothing seems to be able to break it. I took an aspirin thinking it may be blood pressure and that didnt do the trick either; it did seem to help a little but not enough to alleviate the symptoms. At this time; I take 500-750 mg of metformin per day and 20 mg of simvastatin at bedtime. Any answers could help. Thanks in advance."	2010	2010	48	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have taken for 3 years metformin for tip 2 diabetis.I have a burning foot for 3 days.What I can do?	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. I also put a post in the Pregnancy Forum. I'm deperate for information. I found out I was pregnant with baby #3 on July 4. I had my first pre-natal exam today (July 19) and they found sugar in my urine and did a finger stick and it was 300!! I also had high blood pressure. I was unaware that I was having these problems. I thought the dizziness and headaches were pregnancy symptoms (I'm 7 weeks 3 days). My doctor didn't seemed concerned and said they'd discuss everything at my next visit when the blood work came back. However; from what I've been reading I need to get this under control NOW and not wait 3 weeks. Is it possible that my baby has already sustained damage? I have no idea how long or high my blood sugar has been getting. I'm so worried that I may have caused harm or defects to my baby without knowing. I can't believe my doctor just said to wait til I see them again in 3 weeks. Diabetes II runs in my family and I did have a problem 10 years ago with being pre-diabtetic but was fine with diet/excersice. I had no problems with my other two pregnancies. I know that I have to stop eating out and cut out all refined sugars and eat whole grain but what else can I do to control it? I don't have a monitor and can't afford one right now. I know my insurance will cover it but my doctor has to order it. I'm so frustrated. I just want to take care of this baby and I'm so afraid I've already harmed it. Please if you have any suggestions that would be great.	2008	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Pre-treating with Metformin or Avandia for 3 months before tx lowered IR and viral load and resulted in an EVR of 71%....and the patients were co-infected (more difficult to clear) and some non-responders. (from AASLD meeting Nov 2008)..... ""In Chronic Hepatitis C (HCV); Pretreatment with Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) or Metformin Decreases Insulin Resistance (IR) and HCV Viral Load and Increases Early Virologic Response (EVR)."" M. Adler; J.L. Matloff; A.S. Boxer; H. Han; M. Vachon; D.C. Carriero; D.T. Dieterich; ; Mount Sinai School of Medicine; New York; NY; M. Vachon; D.C. Carriero; D.T. Dieterich; Division of Liver Diseases; Mount Sinai School of Medicine; New York; NY; Background: Chronic HCV is associated with increased incidence of insulin resistance (IR); which leads to a lower rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) following treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin (IFN + RBV). Romero-Gomez et al. reported an SVR rate of 32.8% in genotype 1-infected patients with IR (HOMA-IR > 2) compared to 60.5% in those without IR. In addition; IR is associated with increased liver fibrosis and is characterized by a higher viral load; two other independent risk factors for decreased response to treatment. A recent study showed 0/5 EVR in patients with IR who were given a TZD at initiation of IFN + RBV. It is unknown if therapeutic intervention to improve insulin sensitivity prior to anti-viral treatment increases response to HCV treatment. Aim: To evaluate the effect of treatment with TZDs or metformin on IR and viral load prior to IFN + RBV and the impact on EVR. Methods: IRB-approved; we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with chronic HCV from a liver clinic in our center. We included patients with IR treated with either metformin or a TZD for at least 3 months prior to initiating IFN+RBV. We compared HOMA-IR; HCV viral load; liver enzymes and BMI at baseline; after treatment with an insulin sensitizer (IS); and at week 12 of HCV treatment. Results: 17 patients met inclusion criteria. 10 were co-infected with HIV. The average age was 52.2 years; and 82% of patients were genotype 1. 11 patients were treatment-naïve to IFN+RBV. The mean stage of fibrosis was 2.7 on Metavir score in 12 patients. 11 patients received a TZD and 6 received metformin. The mean HOMA-IR decreased from 7.99 to 6.06 after treatment with an IS to 4.60 at 12 weeks of IFN + RBV. There was a significant mean decrease of 0.52 log in HCV viral load on each patient after treatment with an IS (p<0.01). An EVR was achieved in 12 patients (71%). The mean ALT value decreased from 86.2 at baseline to 72.5 (p=0.02) after treatment with an IS to 34.1 IU/L (p=0.01) after 12 weeks of IFN + RBV. BMI significantly decreased from 27.9 to 26.8 kg/m2 (p=0.02) following treatment with an IS. Conclusion: The use of a TZD or metformin improved insulin sensitivity prior to treatment with IFN + RBV. The baseline viral load; a risk factor for decreased response to treatment and until now referred to as an unmodifiable factor; was also significantly lowered. This intervention allowed a 71% rate of EVR in a population of mono and co-infected patients; the majority being genotype 1. This small pilot study suggests that targeting insulin resistance prior to treatment may enhance the chance of response to traditional treatment for chronic HCV. http://aasld.scientificposters.com/epsAbstract.cfm?id=3"	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm having a real dilemna here; and I would really like to see more discussion of this topic. here is a great synopsis I just found: http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n9/full/nm0900_998.html WOW; that was a mouthful!! in light of the findings from all those studies listed I would think this needs much closer examination. In light of the fact that I am currently UND and have no virus; the reversal of fatty liver and less necrosis and less HCC all sounds very appealing; not to mention any reduction in IR would mean ones own Interferon response would be better post tx. and this alone may increase ones chances of an SVR even if begun at the end of an SOC regime. Perhaps now; more than any other time it could help insure one will recognize any lingering HCV and seek and destroy as designed. As long as one kept the dose low; monitored the liver; and watched for lactic acidosis; what would be the harm in trying? arguments in favor or opposed please weigh in; if obese women went from 20% to 60% SVR that should tell us something?? mb	2007	2009	57	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello; I am a thin and highly active 20 year old male who was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The diagnosis is weird because I've never had a poor diet; I played sports; and have little family history of the disease. I should mention though that my father has been ""borderline"" since the age of 12 and now he is 51 and his condition has not changed. I'm not in denial but recently I've been beginning to wonder if I truly have the disease. You see my first fasting glucose test showed that I was high but still below 100 mg/dl. So my doctor ordered glucose tolerance test. The morning of the test several things went wrong and I believe that they merit a retest. I also confess that these things were my fault. First I was massively late. They wanted me there no later than 12-14 hours of fasting when I accidentally slept in and showed up at after 15 1/2 to 16 hours of fasting. The second mistake is that I think I accidentally broke fast. You see I almost reflexively grab my huge mug of coffee every morning without thinking and that morning I did. I had the equivalent of two cups of black flavorless coffee. I am not entirely sure if that affects the exam (my doctor doesn't think so but a lot of the nurses and lab techs do). Anyways I showed up and failed. My number was 220 mg/dl 2 hours after the glucola was administered to me. So my doctor puts me on metformin 500 mg for twice a day (I was also ordered to only take 1 a day for the first two weeks). He also gave me a glucose meter. A few days later I find that I am having the easiest time in the world keeping my numbers in the normal range (at this time I had not started metformin). When I started metformin; I had an adverse reaction and was ordered to stop. A month later my averages are about 108 my fasting is 81-95 and my 2-hour postprandials are almost always below 120 unless I load up on carbs; then they can go anywhere from 125-160 and this is all without medication. Should I demand a retest?"	2012	2012	19	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; My husband was diagnosed with Type 1 at age 29. Thanks to Lantus; Metformin and a very smart diet he has his numbers under control & very rarely has issues. We had our son just months before he was diagnosed and had always planned to have a second child. Now we have reservations about growing our family. What is the lieklihood that our children will inherit the disease? Would it be irresponsible to try for another child? How do other couples make this decision? Thanks; Confused Mom	2010	2010		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; my name is Linda; I live in Australia. I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for five years with cortisone steroid injections for the first four years. Not once did anybody bother to monitor my blood sugar levels; and I was unaware that they could be affected by them. I have recently been diagnosed with High Blood Pressure; and Type 2 Diabetes; my Doctor was aware of all the medications I was on. I was taking Prednisolone 5mg for 1 year; Diclofenac 50mg twice daily for five years; and Perindopril 8mg once daily for a month. About two weeks ago; after feeling sick from the cocktail of medications I was taking. I made a rash decision to ditch all of them except the High blood pressure medication; my blood pressure was 150/109. Since doing so I feel amazing. Four months ago I decided to change my eating habits; quit a 20 year addiction to Coke Zero and started exercising everyday about a month ago; this was very difficult to start with RA; but I already feel amazing differences in my fitness. I have gone from 315 to 292.9 pounds. Since being diagnosed on the 22nd October this year I have cut out all trans-fat products; all artificial sweeteners; and anything made from a factory. I have noticed radical improvements in my weight loss. Half of my weight loss has occurred in the last week. Getting back to my diagnosis; with my OGTT my fasting score was 126; and two hours later it was 257.4. My doctor immediately put me on Metformin 500mg twice daily. He did not discuss any attempts for me to try to manage with diet and exercise. My mother developed Diabetes 4 years ago; she lost 132 pounds and manages her diabetes well. I borrowed her level checker and have been testing myself at fasting; and 2 hours after each meal. My fasting was 108/108/113/95. My 2 hours after lunch were 104/88/91. My 2 hours after dinner were 93/108/122. I read diabetics are unable to come down to fasting levels before a three hour period. Is it possible that I was misdiagnosed? Sorry about the length of the question.	2012	2012	40	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Just watched a short clip on CNN that says based on a population based study; (whatever that is) we have an significantly increased chance of developing diabetes 2. Not a lot of meat to the article and it wasn't even specified whether it was related to interferon use or not. Now; I'm wondering if some of the symptoms I've been feeling is NOT fatigue from Hep C; but diabetes 2. I know I gained too much weight back after failing treatment in 2003; but I am still pretty active and push myself a lot to do THINGS; mow the lawn; take the stairs; etc. Does anybody else wonder about diabetes 2? Sometimes; I get a kind of dizzy feeling; sort of woozy; but it passes quickly. I watch the sugar I eat; but still have a popsicle every day. I'm working on losing 30 lbs; I lost 50 lbs during tx but gained it all back over the last three years; it was quite insidious; very slowly creeping back to my bu tt and thighs. It pops into my head that I am carrying around 30 extra 1 lb. new york strip steaks and no wonder I am freakin tired. I've upped my veges and fruit and have cut back seriously on portions. So I'm thinking I need a glucose meter; take the blood sugar now and then and see what's up. Every once in a while; I will read something that talks about ""insulin-resistance"" and am wondering if this is one of the gifts left to me by IFN. Anybody have any experience with this? Let me know; before I go see my GP; I need to know what to tell him. He is very scared to treat me because of his lack of knowledge about Hep C and is always grateful when I tell him what I need. Sad situation; but my infectious Doc is in Seattle; about 300 miles away. So I am on my own and I don't know about the rest of you; but since I was diagnosed with Hep C; a lot of my treatment has been in my own hands; my own research and I'm glad to do it.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Many scientists believe that diabetes can be prevented. Because the causes of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are different; approaches to preventing each form of diabetes are different. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an allergic-like reaction; probably to insulin; the pancreas; or some substance in the pancreas. If this is true; then it is likely that diabetes can be prevented by giving the vulnerable person miniature shots of insulin; a great deal like allergy; shots may avert fever. This advance has been triumphant in animals that were bred to acquire diabetes. However; this approach was not successful in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial. Other approaches; such as oral insulin; are still being investigated. Type 2 diabetes does not appear to be founded by an allergic response. The cause is probably related to a hereditary defect that reduces a person’s sensitivity to insulin. New medications used early on may avoid type 2 diabetes. In addition; lifestyle changes; including exercise and weight loss; may prevent it. The Diabetes Prevention Program has recently shown that diet and exercise prevent the incidence of diabetes by about 60%; with the oral medication; metformin; preventing about 30%.	2010	2010		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 50 year old man and have been diabetic for 5 years now; I have also been diagnosed with hypertension about a year ago. When I was diagnosed I was 5'9"" and 180lbs. and in decent shape. Diabetes is rampant in my family with both my parents and half of my grandparents and plenty of my uncles and aunts are and were diabetic so I know genetics is a big factor here to. I have just started a diet and exercise regime where I'm eating less than a thousand calories a day( no starches; pasta or other high carb food only oats and lean meat and green veggies) and working out with weights for 1/2 hour the running for a half hour ( I can still bench 250 and run a 6 1/2min mile). My next A1c check is in June and I'm hoping that my A1c will be under 6 but half of this one will be before the diet started so I will be patient and also wait till the next and hopefully it will be closer to 5.5. I am on glyburide 5mg 2x a day and metformin 1000mg 2x a day and just started losartan 50mg once a day. Was taking lisinopril hctz 20-12.5 once daily but had some side effects that I didn't like. I was wondering if by doing this I could put my diabetes into remission like some of the participants in the Newcastle study did or if genetics might have me screwed. Has anybody else had any experience with being able to get off there meds with a lifestyle change. I know according to the charts I was overweight by about 12 lbs back then;I wasn't going to the gym at that time but I was far from a couch potato. I'm not sure what is causing my insulin resistance and hbp. I'm just very unhappy with how things have turned out. Turning 50 has caused me to rethink my thoughts on taking meds and winding up like my most of my relatives who take 10 or so meds daily. Three to me is three to many. I was hoping my biggest mid life crisis decision would be what type of sports car to buy not this. Any personal experiences with being able to get off meds or not would be greatly appreciated.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am on 500 mg of metformin once a day. My doctor said my a1c said above 15. I already have nerve damage and other symptoms. I want to know if this an appropriate treatment; and when i can expect my glucose to return to normal. Also they said my vitamin D levels were extremely low; is that caused by the diabetes? Also; i'm bewildered by this. But they said after my high a1c test; i got blood drawn 10 minuters later; and they said the results of that blood test is that my glucose levels were low 10 minutes later.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I was diagnosed with this I guess about seven years ago. I'm at stage three. 60 years old; male. Geno type 1. Pegasus was mentioned. I haven't asked further as I wanted to review the treatments. Peg-Inton with Rebatol was mentioned as possibly more effective.. but I'm not really sure what exact treatment the Dr. talked about. 48 weeks was suggested. A 30% chance was suggested. I'm talking this over with my family doctor first; but fully expect to jump in. I have only one symptom; which is really mild. Occaisional sort of stabbing in the liver area; lasts about a few seconds.. lays way back.. may repeat one or two times.. and is over in minutes. Never hangs on. Isn't daily. sometimes I go weeks with nothing at all. 48 Weeks seems a long time.. and I'm wondering about the side effects; and how they will affect my daily life. I also wonder if the treatment of those side effects isn't also troublesome in ways I'm not aware of; drugs being what they are. How knocked around should I expect to be during this? 160 lbs; 5' 10"". I am hypothryoid; but it's been perfectly managed with no trouble for 20 years. I'm also diagnosed type II diabetes; but no meds or symptoms. Diet and Exercise with some supplements has given me consistently good tests. For all these conditions; I still feel just fine every day.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My 6 year old grandson was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He was admitted with a blood sugar level of over 2500. After 3 days in intensive care; his CK level rose to 78;000. He tested negative for the diabetes antibody. Two days ago; after 10 days in intensive care he was moved to the regular pediatric floor however his ketones are still at 2000 and the doctors are puzzled why they keep going down then up for no apparent reason. His blood sugar levels vary (400 down to 150) based on what he eats and how much insulin he is given. Still working our the kinks in getting him stablized. Does anyone have any idea what else may be going on to cause all this? We are puzzled and concerned that he may have something else going on that is being missed.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My glucose level one hour after dinner was 260. At two hours after dinner; it was 222 (I know; I know....I shouldn't have had the pizza and popcorn). My fastings have been recently up to 118. Should I be on medication? What levels do most doctors look at when determining to put their patients on medications? I was dxed via the O.G.T.T. going on 11 years ago (I was not pregnant...it was ordered after a routine physical found my fasting at 113). Those results were: fasting 97; 1/2 hr. 220; 1 hr 218; 2 hrs 219; 3 hrs 115. I've lost 30 pounds and kept them off since then and have experienced normal levels (fastings around 97; and under 140 most of the time; sometimes over 200 depending on what I ate; and most a1c's in the 5's). Over the past 6 mos; I've had fastings up to 118. I'll be going in for a new a1c and other bloodwork soon. My last a1c in July was 6.1%. Advice would be appreciated.

Really need advice because I'm really worried and scared as to what is going on with my body! Thanks for taking the time to read the above info: This is rather long so please bare with me I'm sorry about it being so long: Here is my question I'm new to the pcos I actually just found out Wed I do indeed have pcos ; I had been seeing a ob since 2004 which at that time I had my second son the past couple of years seemed fine but my periods just went obsalete and it took me until now with the new obgyn to get answers! They did my blood work last friday and the new ob called me wed to let me know the results he said due to my insalin being up there ( excuse my typo's) he can go ahead and diagnose me with pcos ; he had put me on Provera that made my third time being on that I told him in the past it didn't help but he still insited me try it again so I am ; Well Wed he told me he would like to put me on Metformin which I just picked up last night ; I never been on this medication so I'm not really educated on this ( I hate taking any type of pills) ; So I looked it up on the net and it says its for type 2 diabetes but has been given to women with pcos so I was like ok then there was a rare condition called lactic Acidosis but apparently not common ; so that had me worried a bit ; also he has me on this for 12+ months taking this ; I didn't know that this drug was going to be taken for a long period of time; so that meaning do I have to take this for the rest of my life ? ( he didn't say anything of the sort to me ) He did say this would help me with my weight problem and I would have to becareful because I could get pregnant with this medication which we want to try for another baby but not until I lose some weight ( due to highblood pressure ) with my last pregnancy they had to induce me last time due to that;! Now here is another kicker : I was reading it said to watch my blood suger levels ( obgyn never said anything over the phone ) does that mean I have to check my blood suger everyday ? is there certain types of things I need to watch out for like food wise I don't drink beer or wine anything like that! Any help would be great thank you for taking the time to read all this Thank you ; Amanda	2006	2009	24	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. My name is Summer. I am 30 years old. In November 2008 I went into the hospital with pancreatitis. I knew nothing about pancreatitis before that day but that day changed my life forever. I went into the emergency room 3 times before they finally figured out what was wrong and admitted me. Once they realized the severity of my condition they said if I had waited even 24 before getting treatment I could have died. I was there for 10 days. I spent my 30th Birthday and Thanksgiving in that hospital. I couldn't eat or drink anything for 8 of those 10 days. When I got out I was put on a low fat diet. Tricor to lower my Triglycerides and Metformin to Control my Diabetes. I went through extreme frustration and felt overwhelmed and at times I still do. I never really worried about what I ate before that so now not only watching my fat but also my sugar and carbs is very difficult. Since I've been on the low fat diet my weight has gone from 186 to 146. My family has very low income and there are periods of time where I have to go without the Tricor because we can not afford the $150 dollars a month. I started using NuvaRing in July of 2008. I started having problems of missed periods and horrible cramping pains that had never been that bad before. A few days ago I went online to try and search what could be causing these problems and if they were normal. I found this under possible side effects: In women with inherited defects of lipid metabolism; there have been reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides during estrogen therapy. This has led to pancreatitis in some cases. I stopped using the Nuvaring immediately. Never during that whole time I was in the hospital or months afterwards did any doctor link the pancreatitis to the NuvaRing. I remember having bleeding in the hospital a week early even though the ring was still in. At that time I just thought it was because of the catheter and the nurses did not think it was anything to worry about. My questions are: 1. If the Nuvaring was what was elevating my triglycerides is it possible they will go back to normal and how long after being off them should there start to be a difference? 2. Is it possible that if the Birth Control was causing elavation in my triglycerides could it also be causing my Diabetes? Thank you; Summer	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My mom who is 93 and suffers from type 2 diabetes. She went into a care home five months ago weighing 9stone 4lb. Her weight has increased to 10stone l0lbs in that short time and she is very uncomfortable and breathless. Prior to her admittance into the home she was in hospital and before she was discharged the ward doctor reduced her Metformin from 2 tablets a day to one. Could this be the reason she is putting on so much weight so quickly? I am really worried; as I no longer have control over her health issues; as her GP has been changed to the practice the home has for all their residents and she has not seen this new GP since she moved in. Any suggestions; anyone?	2015	2015		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Greetings During a yearly check-up; my bloodwork showed higher than average glucose levels (7.1). I was then asked to take a GTT ( 2 hour) and the lab results came back as 10.8! My husband is a Type 2; uses insulin and has glucose monitors. They do appear to be working. So; for the past 4 weeks I have been taking morning readings and after meal readings and they are in the 4-6 range which I gather is normal. The A1c test registered 5.6. My GP is convinced I have diabetes and when I did a follow-up appointment and showed her my levels that I put on a spreadsheet; she said she didn't have time and dismissed my concerns and queries. She wanted to put me on Metformin even before the A1c. Is it possible that the first two tests were wrong? I have another appointment with a new GP who was highly recommended to me and I would like a second opinion. It is not that I am in denial; more like the lab findings and the weekly/daily readings tell me something otherwise. This is rather perplexing. Anyone else have this experience? I suppose I would rather this scenario be a proverbial wake-up call than something definitive for the time being. Thank you.	2010	2010		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have type 2 diabetes for about 2 1/2 years now and my medicines have been working until recently. About 2 weeks ago; my blood sugars have been higher than normal; between 200 and 400 all day. Normally they run about 70 to 200. There has not been any unusual stress; nor have I been ill; occassionaly I have eaten things I should not have or more than usual; but not excessivly. I did the same with the food around Thanksgiving and it did not affect the blood sugars like this; I had the occassional high; but not daily and all day like now. A couple of days ago I started to feel shakey; thirsty; urinating alot; nausea; headache; blurred vision; I called my Doctor and he said to go to the Emergency Room to have my urine checked. At the ER; they checked my blood sugar and it was 475; they gave me IV fluids and a shot of insulin which brought it down to 214 two hours later and down to 61 by the time I got home 6 hours later. At that time; I ate dinner and it went up to 89 after dinner; but before bed it was back up to over 200. What else can cause the sudden change in the readings being so high? I take my medicines everyday like I am supposed to. I am not on insulin.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am concerned for my daughter in law. She has not been diagnosed with diabetes (adult) but the doctor says she is borderline and has a ""marker"". The doctor put her on diabetic medication anyway. I feel this is wrong and her body will become dependent on the medication so she will need it. I think she is at a point where it can be controlled by healthier options. I have mentioned this to her; she is watching her diet now and not eating a lot of sugar; but it really doesn't mean anything coming from me. I think she is being ""set up"" to be dependent on medication. Please give me your thoughts so I can pass them on to her. Also; is a ""marker"" nothing more than "" other family members have had it?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hey; welcome to the busiest board in the group; I bet. I tried Pegasys tx in 2002 with viral breakthru at 30 weeks...lost about 40 lbs but have since gained it back. I'm going to the gym and have RADICALLY changed the way I eat......but have a question.........when NASH is combined with Hep C; how much more scared should I be as far as the condition of my liver? I'm dieting and exercising...and the pounds are going away very slowly (five pounds in two months) ; but should I be working harder? No diabetes type 2...never been a drinker....other than having hep c; i have no health issues. Are there any symptoms of NASH? My last biopsy showed something like 20%....my doc was pretty laid back about it; but he's pretty laid back about everything; so I got busy myself. Just wondering if I am on the right track; he didn't really have any advice. Willow	2006	2008	56	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"not really a question;... just wanting some opinions... I figured when she told me ""all of my patients clear"" ; she meant the ones that last the duration of 12 weeks with svr.... well duh... .. talk about spin. cw - I am exercising now on a treadmill that they have set up for the teachers where I teach.. even has cable tv! very cool. my glucose is still high in the morning; 110-120; even thought the metformin has been doubled and I am exercising... maybe it takes awhile? HI apache! yeah; i remember all that. I am just hoping and praying that IR is the reason I failed. As far my doctor goes... of course I am getting a new one... and am seriously thinking of trying to talk my pcp into treating me; as he is quite open to all options. I think he would probably do anything I asked as long as I can back it up with studies ; etc. It is just too hard to run around trying to find a gastro or hepa that is willing to work a little outside of the box... many seem to be content with just following standard protocol.. I guess they reluctant due to lawsuits. My liver doc does want me to come back in ; in april for an ultrasound... probably worthless; although I have had an ultrasound tech that an ultrasound will show a fatty liver as well as liver cancer. I am going to try an wait on the polymerase/protease inhibitor combos for round 2. I just don't have much faith in the infergen; or a retreatment with riba/inf. any opinons? thanks; bandman"	2008	2009		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a Type 2 diabetic for 10 years and on Diamicron (4 tabs) and Metformin (3 tabs) medication daily. My glucose tests has dropped from range of 14-16 middle last year to range of 6-8 this year. Latest Hb1Ac is 6.5 done 2 weeks ago. Beginning this year; I realised I have pain on right side of my body just below the rib cage. Its like needles poking from inside my body. When I walk I feel the tightness around the area and esp after meals; but it will go away after a while. Now the pain is spreading to the other parts of the body on the right side. I find difficulty even wearing my clothes as the pain is sensitive to even my clothes. I am also suffering from erectile dysfunction. I have done ultrasound test; chest x-ray for other major organs and all is ok. I went to see a neurologist who gave me gababentin to help me to sleep as suspect could be my nerves. My neuro mentioned that could be nerve regeneration and to control my diabetes. Gabapentin is costing me a lot and I am not sure how long I need to take this med. Any other forms of help/info - like physiotherapy- to reduce this pain is appreciated. Thank you I need some information and help. Thank you.	2008	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am Diabetic Type 2 on Metformin and Hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure. I have on occasion had fluttering and skipping in my heart beats and shortness of breath that comes on when my heardt acts up. (not neccesarily with exertion) It seems to happen along with pms type symptoms. Bloating; abdominal cramping; depression....and then slight spotting. I have had pelvic ultrasounds...normal; echocardiogram..normal. What could be going on? I tend to have them at the first part of the month; sometimes monthly sometimes several months apart. I am 54 and have not had a period for 8 years now. Some times it lasts for about an hour and sometimes it last for 3 to 4 hours and will be very painfull. Like very severe menstral cramps and coming on like contractions in labor. my blood pressure goes way up ..150/120 and I feel extremely tired and sweaty. Then it all just sort of goes away. Then I will have slight spotting.	2010	2011	54	Female

Her finalization could be any day now. I am now 8w3d. I am on z.ofran for my m/s and still on progesterone. Our next appointment is Monday with our RE!!! . luvkayln ; 1 hour ago Rachjas- I had morning sickness from like 6-8 weeks; but barely...! Guess I'm getting lucky this time around; hehe! ;) I just feel completely different this time around; totally different then when I was pregnant with the girls; and I know each pregnancy is different but it just amazes me at how different each one can actually be! :) Can't wait to hear your update from your apmt on Monday! I know you're anxious to see that lil bean! ;) How are you feeling? Guesito- The baby's room is adorable! :) I'm glad the contractions have stopped; what a relief!! Wow; you're good!

You're on it! ;) 7 weeks will be here before you know it! ************************************************************************************************************************************ Guesito: Oh my; I hope you stay contraction free! As for the backaches; be careful because you could be contracting in your back (back labor); keep an eye on it. Also; be sure to tell your massage therapist of the GD and high blood pressure and contractions. Chances are (sorry!) that you will not be able to get a massage. I am a massage therapist and if you have any of those; we require a note from your OBGYN stating it's okay to recieve a massage. I'm not sure of the massage licensing laws in FL; but here in OH we are the strictest state and the hardest tested state throughout the U.S. Rest up and make sure you are drinking enough water. Luvkayln: 12wks?!! Geesh! It seems like just yesterday you told us! I'm glad you aren't having much morning sickness...although we are relieved to get it; it's just rough lol! We got hit by the same snow storm you guys did - except here we got at least 1-2 inches of ice. It was nasty out. Rachjas: How is the zofran working for you? I had it with DD but quit taking it when it made me sooo completely constipated (TMI sorry!). Ginger ale works really well and small amounts of carbs at a time; like toast or small bagel and such. Hope all is well and I can't wait until all the papers are finalized! trh: Almost there!!! How are you feeling? Are you getting really excited yet? I can't wait to see pictures!!! Has anyone heard from Keyan lately? The last I heard was she needed a biopsy and haven't heard anything yet... AFM: Well; Peyton turned 1 yesterday... :-( I can't believe how fast time has gone by!!! She is walking everywhere and getting into everything lol!!! She's getting so big too; she has her 1 year well check next Tuesday. Besides the ice storm we had here; we are all doing well. DH went out and bought a generator in case we lost power b/c of all the ice accumulation; but thankfully it didn't go out. We are expecting more snow this weekend and again Monday and Tuesday. Oh joy lol! I'm ready for warmer weather!!! I hope you all are doing well!! Hugs; Love and SSBD to all :-)	2008	2011	25	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"by Richard Knox Most people wouldn't think diabetes and cancer have anything to do with each other. But a group of experts from the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association thinks they do. A consensus statement from that panel says there's accumulating evidence that people with diabetes are; in fact; more prone to certain cancers. The analysis is published in the latest CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. It turns out that diabetics are twice as likely to get cancer of the liver; pancreas and uterine lining. Their risk of colon; breast and bladder cancer is 20 to 50 percent higher than non-diabetics'. There doesn't seem to be any higher risk for others; such as lung cancer. And the risk of prostate cancer is actually lower among diabetics. Doctors have noticed since the 1950s that their diabetic patients seem to get cancer more often than usual. But it wasn't until last year that researchers pulled together data from various studies and found an association. Also last year; several epidemiology studies got a lot of attention when they suggested that a synthetic long-acting insulin called glargine seems to increase the risk of cancer. But that's still highly debatable. Other studies indicate that metformin; the most common drug for Type 2 diabetes; may actually reduce the risk of getting cancer or dying from it. And just how might diabetes increase the risk of cancer? On that point there's only speculation. Here are some possibilities: Shared risk factors: Both cancer and diabetes become more common as people age; gain weight; eat diets poor in fruits; vegetables and whole-grain cereals; or smoke. Men have higher risk of both diabetes and cancer. Off-kilter metabolism: Many cells in the body have surface receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factors that have been shown in the test tube to stimulate the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. About half of Type 2 diabetes and all Type 1's take insulin daily; and their blood-insulin levels spike higher than normal. Diabetic patients also have episodes of higher-than-normal blood sugar; which might promote cell cancer growth. The fat-tissue hypothesis: Being overweight and obese is the most prominent risk factor for diabetes; and scientists now know that fat tissue is like an endocrine gland; putting out a number of hormone-like substances. These might play a role in turning normal cells into cancerous ones; or promote cancer cell growth. Cancer in overfed laboratory animals behaves more aggressively. All these questions need a lot more research. But the consensus panel says it will be hard to do good human studies because the issues are so complex and lots of people would have to be followed for many years. They call for more good ""observational"" studies comparing cancer incidence in diabetics and nondiabetics and correlating cancer incidence with blood chemistry and different treatments. Meanwhile; the evidence so far justifies even more attention to healthy diets; weight control and physical activity among diabetics; the consensus panel says. And doctors should look carefully for any signs of early cancer in patients with diabetes. npr.org"	2008	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a 42 year old female with high blood pressure. I am taking hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) and benazepril (20mg). My pressure is currently under control. I also was diagnosed with diabetes but not my fasting sugar is down to 103 and 2 hours after a meal my sugar is 120. I was prescribed metformin and the dose has been cut in half since my sugars have gone down. I was originally 204lbs. and now I weigh 167; so I'm loosing weight by watching my diet and walking 5 days a week and cardio 1-2 times a week. I've recently been having chest discomfort (not pain) between the breast area and some discomfort in various parts of my arm. I sometimes feel like I have to vomit and go through the motion but nothing ever comes up. The doctor says that's symptoms from the metformin. My LDL is 87; HDL is 56; & Triglycerides are 110. My Dr. feels like everything is ok by insisted on a visit with a cardiologist. So next week I'm scheduled for a strees test. My concern is that there could be something wrong with my heart. I'm concerned that this could be the begining stages of a heart attack. Oh; I've been battling panic attacks on and off for the last 3 years.	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Most of my teen years I was obese. I weighed atleast 200 pounds at 5'2. I ended up having 2 children and got to my lowest weight after my second child which was 145 pounds. I only stayed that way for about 2 years and then I ballooned back to 220. My doctors told me that I had type 2 diabetes; polyistic ovarian syndrome and thyriod problems. I have never had any problems with cyst but i have been irregular every since I started. I will only have two periods a year. My doctor put me on metformin; but i can not tolerate it. I would eat with it but still get very nauses and weak. I struggled for 2 weeks on it thinking my body would get use to the medicane but it didn't. I ended up loosing 7 pounds; but the symptoms were unbearable. I ended up having to stop the metformin. My weakness is sugar. I hate this. Is there any other people suffering with the same problem with metformin? Is it normal to get sick with it?	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello all; I am just writing to get aquainted with PCOS. I have a Prolactin Producing Pituitary Tumor; Hashimotos Thyroid; Type 2 diabetes; Depression; High Blood Pressure; and now apparently PCOS... My dr. has been testing for Cushing's but has decided PCOS to be more probable. I have always dealt with endometriosis and cysts. I was on birth control for 2 years and my symptoms decreased; but I gained a lot of weight. (40 lbs) Since beginning treatment for the tumor and thyroid condition I had ceased the medication I was on for Diabetes and just been controlling it with diet and exercise. (I was started on Metformin and switched to Janumet). My dr. has suggested I go back on Metformin for weight loss; regulate my periods and help with unwanted hair growth that has begun. Any suggestions; tips or other would be appreciated. PS. I have a 7 year old son from my first marriage. I am 30 and my husband and I started trying for a baby about 6 months ago.	2008	2009	30	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I had a question...I resently have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was put on Metfomin; 500mg 2 times a day. And so far I don't feel like it has helped me at all. The side effects that I got from Metformin have not gone away yet; I still have nausea; I'm never hungry; and to top it all off my BG levels are still very high even with my diet. I have been taking it for about 2 months now; but I don't know if i should go see my doctor already or keep waiting for the whole 3 months he prescribed the pills for. What should I do?	2009	2009	18	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Im a type 2 diabetic my a1c tested at 6 .3 after using metformin and glypicide increasing doses my A1c test 6 months later is 9.5 Nothing seems to work. I have altered my diet get an hour walking everyday. Now my doctor has put me on apidra insulin injecting after meals 5 to 7 units. I also have neuropathy extreme burning in my feet. My fasting sugar levels are always at least 100 points higher than when i go to bed. My question is Is there any thing wrong with a type 2 diabetic using insulin after meals; will it accelerate my disease? Also i used the atkins diet for 2 years prior to being diagnosed with diabetes; being in ketosis much of that time could that of brought on type 2 diabetes?	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Is there a relationship between untreated insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes and hyper-acidity resulting in a bloated stomach causing breathlessness and tachycardia? The reason I am putting up this question is that my OGTT indicated insulin resisatance/diabetes (blood glucose 202 mg/dl at 2 hours) and I started on metformin 500 SR + light exercize; the result was complete remission of the acidity and the bloated stomach and the resulting tachycardia and breathlessness [ I had been suffering from this condition for over a year ].	2012	2012	64	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was just diagnosed with type II diabetes. I have been taking 500mg of metformin 2X a day. I took my medicine this morning at 10am. I felt thirsty and had dry mouth about an hour afterwards. At 12:30pm I took a glucose reading. It was 149 mg and I had nothing to eat prior to that. Is my blood sugar high? Do I need to go back to the doctor and have him up my metformin? I don't want to be like this and I am worried sick about it. Please advise. Thank you in advance.	2007	2008	41	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes; 7 years ago; while pregnant with my son. I continued to have problems after the pregnancy and was told by all who tested me that I was a type 2 diabetic. For nearly 7 years; I lived believing that I was diabetic; testing my daily sugars; attemping ot make healthy eating choices (that was not easy for me); and exercising as much as my schedule would allow. I moved from one city to another. I told my new health care phsycian about my condition. She did a work up on my blood; etc. As I was getting ready to ask her for the prescription that would allow my diabetic supplies to be covered under my health insurance...She tells me that I never had diabetes; and then prescribed two months worth of metformin. I have never been on ANY type of diabetic pill or insulin either before or after that. When my test results arrived back at her office. She said I was fine except there were traces of protein in my urine. Since going off my somewhat healthy diet; I've experienced..mood swings; a rash (that was common when my sugars were off the charts); fatigue; lathargic;etc. I relaize that those may all be symptoms of just not eating right and exercising... But should I have cause to worry about this Doc's Diagnosis? She is supposedly a Specialist in the field of Diabetes... My sugar tests are recently around 150 and have been as high as 185 to 195. Is there cause for alarm? I sometimes sleep immediately after a meal; experience dizziness; wake in the middle of the night and lose feeling to my hands. Thanks; TAZ	2004	2004

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes with blood glucose of 506 with eGFR of 70. When I went back 2 days later to do additional blood work (I had been on Metformin for 2 days); my blood glucose came back at 246; microalbumin at 357; creatine of 156 and eGFR at 89. What does this mean? Do I have kidney disease for sure since my microalbumin was so high? Or do they have to redo labs or do other labs to confirm? At most I have only had diabetes for 2 years; my routine blood work showed blood glucose of 124 in 2010 although I was never told till now. Please help. Thank you.	2012	2012		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 22 years old. In the beginning; I used insulin for almost 3 years. Then I realized I can control it with oral drugs; so I changed insuline to actoplus and metformin 15/850 twice a day. Now; my A1C has been keeping at range 5.8-6.2 for the past 2 years. I read some paper about MODY a few days ago. Now I am worrying about if I have MODY. I am 29 now. I am the only one with diabetes in my family history. I am overweighted and my BMI is 2.75. Both actoplus and metformin work very well for me. Will you please give me any advice if I should go to do MODY tests? Thank you for your any help.	2011	2011	29	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I`ve lost 30 pounds in the last 3 months without wanting to. I`ve just been diagnosed diabetic type 2; but unlike most diabetics who are trying to lose weight; I want to STOP losing weight; mainly because a lot of it is muscle - don`t mind the fat going; but I want to keep the muscle :-) My new meter shows my blood sugar levels are pretty high (average about 450 or 27-ish; tho` have been off the scale of the meter once or twice.. So I have to watch the carbs; but is there any reason why I should not start eating a lot more meat to stop losing muscle? losing 4"" off thighs and 3"" off biceps is no fun. Any other suggestions? As I understand it my insulin is ok at the moment but my body is not communicating with my blood and not taking nourishment from it. I`m 200 pounds now (over 6 foot) Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I don`t see a type 2 diabetes forum."	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Several months ago during some routine testing the doctor said my insulin level was too high. On the report it did not show outside the normal but she said the usually accepted cut off for insulin resistance was lower than my level. I was placed on 500mg metformin; told to cut out process/refined sugar; carbs; and be re-tested. This process has continued and now I am on 2000 mg of metformin and my levels are actually higher. I have not been perfect with the diet but certainly much better than before. I actually had recently lost 50 lbs on a high protien diet before I had the initial tests run. My weight loss physician had told me I was losing the weight kind of fast and I needed to gradually bring back in good carbs. So I started that; maintained the weight loss for 3 years and now am told I am insulin resistant. So now I am trying to increase my exercise and back off any carbs as much as possible. I guess my questions are 1. what are the ""numbers"" I am looking at? My glucose was not high on the tests but she said my insulin was. She kept mentioning number sin the teens; like she said 14 was a cut off and I am at like 15; then 21; then 19... 2. what am I supposed to be eating? I am afraid to eat anything. 3. Why would the metformin not be working? Any help would be great!!"	2009	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a Type II diabetic (diagnosed 10 years ago) on metformin (1;000 mg. daily) and prandin (2 mg with meals). I have been diagnosed with a heart problem and have been exercising regularly as part of cardiac rehab. I have been experiencing frequent sugar lows; resulting in blurred vision and dizzyness. Last week; I awoke in the hospital after having diabetic seizures. I remember feeling weak and taking some glucose tablets. Apparently these weren't enough to ward off the seizure. I am worried about future seizures. Specifically; I am wondering if the seizures might aggravate my heart condition. I have a fully blocked coronary artery. I am also worried about possible brain damage. Should I continue with my exercise? How can I prevent future seizures; given that blood sugar monitoring has not helped tip me off to these sudden drops in blood sugar. I have been told not to drive for six months. Are there other activities I should curtail? How common is it for these seizures to recur? I have eliminated the prandin but remain on metformin. Any info would be appreciated.	2005	2005

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Over several years my FBG numbers have been in the 100 to 116 range. Six months ago my A1c was 6.2 then it was retested in June and again it was 6.2. My doctor says this means I do not have diabetes. Since the beginning of June I have tried to lose weight and have been checking my FBG every morning. After 1 1/2 months of low carb dieting my FBG is getting worse. The last six days FBG has been between 127 and 141. Another confusion for me is that I don't have spikes in BG during the day. I have tested 1hr; 1&1/2 hrs. and 2hrs after eating and I never go above 145. However; if I eat a regular carb meal my BG will spike at 145 and then stay above 125 for 3 or 4 hrs. I have not had one BG test below 100 since I started testing in June. What should I do or What can be done about this?	2013	2014	65	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosied with Type II Diabetes 2 years ago. I am having a wide variance in the fasting blood sugar results each morning. If I test just as soon as I get up my FBS is between 130-150. If I wait about 30-45 minutes; shower and get dressed the numbers increase to between 170-190. I haven't eaten or had anything to drink in this time period. Is there a reason for this sudden increase? Which number is my real FBS? I stopped taking my Metformin when I was only testing first thing in the morning because my numbers were lower (and I couldn't remember to take it after eating something). Now I wonder if I did the right think in stopping. Should I go back on the Metformin and what numbers do I report to my doctor?	2008	2008	55	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Mid last year when my A1C was 6.9 and I went on a very low carb diet I had taken another A1C at home 3 months later and my A1C went to 7.3 around December 2012. I kept on the very low carb diet; eating mostly proteins - fish fish and more fish I started losing weight really fast. I was originally at 112 - 115 keeping my weight at that by eating a ton on carbs. As soon as I was diagnosed I cut out carbs and now my weight is at 92 - 95 pounds. I am very small boned and when I was younger I weighed between 90 & 95 pounds until I turn 40 something. My morning blood sugar fasting when I was first diagnosed at hardly ever below 135 in the morning. Even the first 3 months with a high protein low carb diet my sugar was staying about 125 in the morning. Now it is between 105 and 119 every morning but I have to hardly eat to maintain this blood sugar fasting. I am not on any medications at this time. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can keep my weight from going down any further without my blood sugars going up? My last A1C was 6.2 - Thanks so much; Julie	2011	2013		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	[I] [B] 3years ago I had a mild stroke; and since that day; ive been having TIA type attacks near daily. WHY? I need answers and help PLEASE[/b] I am requiring any help feedback; as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms; 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others in Doncaster; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company;I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully more than 23yrs and a director of my own businesses; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old.Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago; whilst out with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. My 24year old daughter said; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; [b]‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’[/b] I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. However from the moment I had this mild stroke I have been getting recurring stroke like type symptoms; for now 3years after from 3 to 7days a week during my sleep and frequently during the day. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months;its virtually stopped. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a heavy attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; dizziness; pain in my head; pain in my left eye socket; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so.

Then 3years ago; whilst out with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have a pituitary tumor; hashimotos and type 2 diabetes. My A1c is 5.5 at most recent testing and my highs up until recently have never gone above 180. However; I started having really bad lows frequently so my dr. said I could stop taking my Janumet. Recently she suggested going back to Metformin for weight loss and PCOS possibility. I have stuggled with the Metformin gas; stomach cramps and loose stools. However; I really want to make it work because lately I have been having high blood sugars. Tonight I got up to 300 for the first time ever. (when testing anyhow). I have been drinking gobs of water and retesting and it is coming back down; still at 220 right now. Any suggestions? (PS.. yes I did eat dessert tonight... and that is the cause of the high). When I was pregnant 8 years ago and had gestational diabetes; I had no problem controlling my blood sugars and always staying below 120; but I am really struggling with it now.	2008	2009	30	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hey; just wondering if i could cease taking metformin for type 2 diabetes and lisinipril and if it would be beneficial for me to replace them with a natural Taurine supplement? I've read studies that suggest Taurine helps high blood pressure and diabetes among a ton of other illnesess; the reason I ask is because lisinipril has some rather severe side effects; I don't want to be taking a lot of chemical tablets when they could be replaced with something that is natural for my body instead of something that could be detrimental to my health in the long run; doctors nowadays seem to like to give out other drugs to treat side effects which in turn causes other side effects in a vicious cycle; they are also trying to get me on statins (surprise; surprise..). Any advice would be welcome; thanks in advance :).	2014	2014		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	i was at a party and a girl who had recently became a mother; put breastmilk on her finger and put it in my mouth; I have read that enzymes and stomach acid would kill the virus; but I am on anti-depressants; tablets that reduce stomach acid and metformin for type 2 diabetes; would I still have the neccesary enzymes and stomach acid to kill the virus taking into consideration my medical conditions; I also do not know her HIV status do not know a lot about her	2014	2014		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 5 years ago. My care is currently through my Family Doctor. My last two HA1C tests were 7.2 and 7.4; and creatinine was 1.1. I am taking Metformin XR; 1 gm twice a day; total of 2 grams (four 500 mg tablets). I take 1 gram in the morning and 1 at night. My blood sugars tend to run high in the morning and decrease during the day. I have no specific instructions whether to take at meals; with water; etc. Would it likely make any difference to take 1.5 grams at night and 0.5 in the morning; or take it with meals or with water. I asked this of my family doctor and she was uncertain if it would make a difference. I also take glimperide; enalapril for hypertension and Crestor for high cholesterol.Although I have great trust in my Family Doctor; I am making an appointment with an Endocinologist to get advice on my medications; but that is not for 5 weeks. I would like to know your opinion on how to take Metformin; although I realize ultimately I need to follow my Doctor's advise.	2006	2010

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 42 year old female; married and in a monogamous relationship. Last week; I noticed a fairly round; brown dime-sized splotch of skin in my groin in the upper; inner thigh region. It does not itch and does not appear to be scaly. I also have had intermittent diarrhea for the past few months; although my gastroenterologist attributes this to irritable bowel syndrome. I am on Metformin for being in a ""pre-diabetes"" state and take birth control pills for PCOS. Finally; I have lost ten pounds in the last few months; although my doctor attributes this to the Metformin. Could you please advise as to what this brown splotch could be? I am wondering if it is some type of fungal infection (or something worse?) Thank you."	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have developed diabetes type 2 one year ago (aged 54) Hb1ac <6 on metformin 500mg/day; losartan 50mg; & simvastatin 20 mg/day. Have oedema on pads of fingers (developed over last 6 months) which is worse on thumbs which causes the skin to be fragile. Have tried steroid ointment but does not seem to help so just use E45 ointment which keeps the skin from becomming too dry. GP seems to think it is ematitis but have not been able to find specifc agent causing problesm - any ideas?	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 3 months ago. He has been able to control his sugar levels very well and is currently taking 1000 mg of Metformin daily. Within the last 3 weeks he has started having joint pain and now his ankles and feet are swelling. We have been to the doctor and they have run several blood test and have found no problems but yet he continues to be in pain. He can hardly walk on his feet. They did give him something for inflammation but it is not working. Does anyone have any ideas or has anyone experienced the same symptoms? We are desperate to find out what is going on. He is not overweight and does not have high blood pressure. The pain is also in his elbows and knees.	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	A few months ago I was diagnosed with PCOS; and I'm insulin resistant. My doctor told me that I need to go on Metformin and a low-glycemic index diet to avoid getting type 2 diabetes (and other problems) in the future. So I have been on 500mg of Metformin daily; and I've followed a low-glycemic index diet. I recently went back for testing and all of my levels are back to normal. My question is; every once in a while; if I want to splurge; is it ok? For example; could I have a slice of chocolate cake and a scoop of ice cream on my birthday; as long as I restrict carbs and sugars for the rest of the day? Thanks!	2008	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Due to undiagnosed hypothyroid I gained 75lbs over a few months. With this weight gain I was then diagnosed with diabetes type 2. I have since lost half of the weight and have been able to reduce my metformin. One dr tells me I will probably never be able to stop my metformin and an other states they think I could lose 10 more pounds and not take any meds for my diabetes. Really confusing. Question is: After I eat my blood sugars go into the 200s and this lasts a couple hours. I feel so confused and drunk during this time. Then my sugar goes back to a nice 80-100 bld sugar level. My A1Cs are great between a 5-6 every month. I really do not like this feeling and makes me plan my outtings so I dont get into trouble driving or being embarassed around others as my speech slurs. Is there anything I can do? I wish I knew if this was damaging me during these two hours.	2011	2014		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	No one ever answers the type 2 diabetic forum so I thought I would try here. I have been a type 2 diabetic for 8 years. For the last year I have been on metmorfin 1000 mg a day. increasing everyday I have severe painful bowel movements. So bad that I have to curl up into a fetal position to get releif. I saw my dr on apr 30th and he took me off the metmorfin and put me on Actos 30mg. Been on if for a week now. My painful bowel problem went away and I finally ventured out of the house and did a days full of activity without have to keep running to the bathroom every 5 minutes. My blood sugars during this week have shot up above 300 but below 400. So yesterday I called my dr and he told me to go back on metmorfin plus the actos. He wants to start me on an injectible med but I am going out of town next week so he won't start it; that is why he told me to go back on metmorfin. I just started to cried because I was just starting to feel better and now after being back on the metmorfin for 24 hours I have having my issues again. Not to mention I am going on a cruise next weekend and I don't want to have this problem. I don't know what to do;;; my dr. told me to just suck it up for a few more weeks and we will get off the metmorfin in June and go on the injectible berrta med. What would happen if I just waited for the actos 30mg to take effect and no take the metmorfin. I restarted it yesterday and today I feel like ****. My stomache hurts; I have been in the bathroom almost all day.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My mother (75yrs) goes in for a bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection tomorrow morning (July 17th) ; it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently. Presently her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency?	2008	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My A1C has been improving slightly through weight loss; diet and exercise. It is now at 6.6 At its highest it was 7 or just under. I am not taking medication at present. My daily readings are slightly high in the morning at approx. 130 (dawn effect!); but normal the rest of the day at 100 or less. My GP prescribed 4x500 mg of Metformin daily which I am too hesitant to take. Any thoughts please?	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi! After a really bad SVT where I ended up in A& E; my Dr perscribed Labetalol 400mg per day. I have had three bad SVT's over 5 years; which lasted between 2 and 3 hours; but hardly anything in between; but since taking the meds for a month I have had a few very small SVT's which last only seconds and stop when I hold my noise and blow. Would the meds be making this happen.	2010	2010	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Ok; I am type 2 diabetic. I am currentlyI taking Metformin 500mg (take 1 table by mouth every morning and 2 tablets with supper); Glipizide 10mg (take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day); and Pravastatin Sodium 20mg (take 1 tablet by mouth daily). Last night around 9pm I eat 2 pieces of fried chicken with red beans and white rice; season fries; coleslaw. I did not eat all day to I guess you can say I over did it. Anyway; after two hours my blood sugar was at 350 (that's the highest i've ever seen it) so I took 2 more of my metformin. In the morning I woke up with abdominal pain and diarrhea. I ate a 1/2 of a oatmeal cook and after a few seconds I had to go to the restroom. As I was using the restroom I notice 3 yellowish oval shaped stool; I went ahead a examined it. When I sliced it the middle I saw it was white inside and the texture of the yellowish oval shaped stool was almost fatty; liver like. Can anyone please let me know if this is serious? Or is it ok and most likely it well go away after a while?	2011	2011		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	About two months ago my dr told me I had type 2 diabetes. This was based on a fasting 3 hour glucose test and likely my weight. Since then I have been checking my sugars at least twice a day and making better choices when eating. Nothing too restrictive; just less stupid. She also put me on 500 mg of metformin once a day. In that two month period my blood sugar has never measured over 119. My fasting BS (in the morning) is almost always under 100 and never over 119. Two weeks ago my A1C was 5.6. Am I truly diabetic and just doing a good job at managing it or did I just need to wise up on what I ate and when? Thanks!	2014	2014		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I found out I had Diabetes type 2 in October 2007; I am still learning to find out what I can eat to control my blood glucose levels. My doctor put me straight onto Metformin. 12 years ago I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid. I was diagnosed by tests that I had an underactive thyroid for which I have been treated for ever since. I have never weighed anything more than 144lbs. I am 5 ft 5 inches tall. When I was put onto the medication for Thyroid the weight dropped off and stayed off. I then weighed 135lbs and managed to maintain this weight until October last year when I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. First I didn't believe the doctor; but high glucose levels were found in my urine and blood; so I started working with him. I am not overweight problem and have no other symptoms. My doctor tells me I'm the fittest diabetic he has. But I am still confused. Did they misdiagnose my Thyroid problem? I'm still losing weight too. Will I stop losing weight that I can ill afford to lose at somepoint and how do I manage to juggle maintaining the weight that I have and my blood glucose levels. I've accepted that I have diabetes.. but still don't understand why?.. especially since it seems I am the first member of my family to get it.. I have found no links to genetics at all. And as for the tyroid.. I'm still unsure of the diagnosis as when I started on the Metformin the doctor lowered my dose of Thyroxine by 50 micrograms and this had no ill effect on. Can you help?	2008	2008	47	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"It seems this forum is becoming an alternative / supplement forum so I hope it is ok to post this. Here is an interesting article about a prescription drug; the diabetic drug Metaformin. An old drug that has been around a long time. And is very inexpensive. They are finding it has many uses including anti-cancer properties. I think it is great when an existing drug is found to work for other diseases. Especially drugs that patents have run out and are now inexpensive. Also Metaformin has shown promise against many cancers. You will hear more about off label Metaformin use in the near future. Research led by the University of Leeds has found drugs such as anti-diabetic drug Metformin and AICAR; used to combat obesity; can prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating in the body. Hepatitis C virus affects an estimated three per cent of the world's population and there are four million carriers of the virus in Europe alone. The virus affects the liver and recovery rates are low: only around 40 per cent of hepatitis C sufferers will fully recover; with others developing cirrhosis and in many cases; liver cancer. ""We're very excited about these findings;"" says Professor Mark Harris from the University's Faculty of Biological Sciences. ""These drugs are already on the market; and whilst substantial clinical trials still need to take place before they can be used to treat hepatitis C infection; we think it could be an enormous step forward in the battle against the virus."" The research was supported by the Wellcome Trust; the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. Drugs such as Metformin and AICAR work by stimulating an enzyme called AMP kinase (AMPK) which regulates energy within our cells - the very enzyme that hepatitis C virus represses to enable it to replicate. AMPK's usual function is to conserve the energy balance in cells; which it does by temporarily shutting down the production of lipids (fats) and membranes when it senses an increase in energy requirements. Professor Harris and his team have now shown that the hepatitis C virus switches off AMPK so that the cell continues production of lipids and membranes; both of which are vital to its survival. ""You'd expect AMPK to be activated when a cell becomes infected by a virus; because it would sense the increase in energy required to enable the virus to replicate. In such cases; AMPK would shut down certain functions of the cell temporarily until the cell's energy is rebalanced;"" says Prof Harris. ""We found that hepatitis C virus; because it needs lipids and membranes; causes the opposite to happen."" Building on this finding; the research team were able to examine how cells would react when treated with common drugs that stimulate AMPK. They found that in infected cells; the drugs were able to halt virus replication; enabling cells to clear the infection. A patent has been filed on the discovery and the team will shortly embark on a small-scale clinical trial with The University of Nottingham. This will provide a greater evidence base upon which future clinical trials can be based. More information: This research is published in a paper entitled Enhanced hepatitis C virus genome replication and lipid accumulation mediated by inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase in the latest edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)."	2006	2010	52	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 53 year old female with a family history of Type 2 diabetes. In the last two years; I have put on a significant amount of weight (probably 35-40 pounds); almost all of it in the belly. I seem to be hungry all the time and I'm fatigued a lot. I keep reading about belly fat and insulin resistance and hunger; so I got myself tested for diabetes. My numbers came back as follows: fasting glucose was 86; insulin was less than 2.0 and Hemoglobin A1c was 5.3. For good measure; I bought a glucose meter and my fasting glucose is always normal; although after eating carbohydrates; my glucose will rise to about 122 one hour after a meal and then instead of falling; at two hours; I will be at 126 or so. My doctor said these numbers are completely normal and; in fact; given the excess belly weight that I am carrying; I must have a gene that is protecting me from becoming diabetic. I have a few questions. Do you think any further diabetes testing is warranted? Could a drug like Metformin help me lose weight even if I am not diabetic? I am really at wit's end with my weight gain. I had two Cushing's workups which came back negative. I was diagnosed last year with Hashimoto's; but I am on thryoid replacement and with replacement have a TSH of 2.75. Am I just wasting my money with more diabetes' tests? I just don't know what is wrong with me.	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Recently; after a very long day (about 20 hrs.); I began to notice that my vision was similar to that when I am cross-eyed. After resting sufficiently; I am still having the same problem 2 days later. The best that I can see in the mirror is that 1 eye is not always moving as quickly as the other; but a lazy eye doesn't seem to be realistically caused by fatigue. Otherwise; my eyes do not visually appear to be crossed; but my vision comes off as such. Is this something that will go away; or should I see an optometrist or physician? Is there anything I can do to improve without seeing a dr.? If it helps; I have both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and take a whole lot of insulin as well as metformin and actos (also for low HDL). I also have hasimoto's disease.	2009	2009	23	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello; My mom just turned 50 this year. She was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes two years ago and was 168 pounds at 5""5'. Her doctor put her on Metformin; and she is supposed to be on it for life. Her doctor told her that she would lose weight on it; and the lowest she's been so far is 143 pounds when she weighed herself within the past couple of days. She was at the doctor in December because she had laryngitis and she was weighed at 150 and he was glad about the weight loss. However; I am worried because she lost 6 pounds in a month without even trying. She tells me that it's from the Metformin and because she just started working two jobs last month and she moves around a lot; rather than her staying at home all day like she used to. She has always eaten healthy so I can't say that her weight loss is from a change in eating habits. She is also on medication for overactive thyroid; asthma; and high cholesterol. I just can't help but be really worried about this. I know her doctor told her that she would lose weight on Metformin; but wouldn't she have seen the weight loss right after she started it? And not continue to lose weight 2 years later? She had a colonoscopy two years ago and her doctor said she looked great and he wants to see her in 10 years for another colonoscopy; however; she had some type of bacteria in her stomach that causes ulcers so she went on meds for a week to get rid of it. I did some research on unexplained weight loss on the web and I am really worried that it is cancer; particularly in the stomach. Please help me out! Thank you. She also has been getting hemorrhoids about once or twice a month; is that normal? or a symptom? I know I sound crazy right now but I just hate worrying."	2009	2010	19	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; Heres the background Am currently being checked for PCOS. Have had a brain MRI to r/o pit tumor and MRI and CT scan of the adrenals. All are neg. I failed the 24 hour urine for cortisol but passed the dexamethasone suppression test. On the CT scan cystic adnexa were found bilaterally on the ovaries so now the endo is looking at PCOS. I have a infertility hx; was eventually able to concieve with added progest. due to a short luteal phase. If it is found to be PCOS.....what are the chances of having insulin resistence (what is this anyway) and developing type 2 diabetes. What would the symptoms of insulin resistence be? How is it treated? can it be managed by a PCP or should an Endo oversee care? Thanks	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Was diagnosed 4 years ago w/diabetes type 2. Went to all the classes; was put on Metformin and a couple other meds. Taught to check my blood sugar a couple times a day. Knew I had to lose weight; change to a healthier diet; and get exercise. Was noncompliant with education/meds/blood sugar monitoring/weight loss/exercise/dietary recommendations. Now I have swollen feet and I feel terrible. My feet became very swollen for the first time yesterday. Gained more weight over the past couple of years; instead of losing it. What does this swelling mean? Are my kidneys and heart failing now? I'm scared; and don't want to go to the doctor; who will just tell me everything all over again. Please help!.	2014	2014		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 45 year old woman; 60 pounds overweight. I am losing weight and currently take 2500mg of metformin per day. My blood sugars are never over 200 and usually range from 90 to 150. Recent bloodwork has shown that I am positive for GAD antibodies. I have been told that <2 is normal and mine was +12. I have been put on a very small dose of Lantus as well! Am I becoming Type I? I know that I am insulin resistant; and borderline Type II...my highest A1c within the last year was 6.2. It usually stays at 5.8 or 5.9. Will the Lantus stop what the antibodies have started...will my pancreas completely stop making insulin due to the antibodies? Can anything stop it? I know continued weight loss and exercise will help Type II; but what about Type I. Am I doomed? Thanks for any assistance!	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Haven't yet been in to see an endocrinologist or a dietary person to talk blood sugar levels and diet. Am having problems dealing with my insurance company who won't even cover my stupid testing strips. They basically are $1 a strip. Expensive. I had gestational diabetes several years ago (gestational diabetes was covered 100% for supplies and visits); so I am aware of how to do all the blood testing and have been doign fine about that. I also know that gestational diabetes is more strict with blood sugar levels than regular type II diabetes. Now that I have type II; what are the ranges to aim for for blood sugar levels for fasting and then for 2 hours after a meal? Right now; I'm testing about 100 to 110 in the morning and about 110 to 130 after meals. If I forget to take my metformin at night; my fasting level is usually around 120 to 130. But; with the medicine it is 100 to 110 fasting. Is this good? Is it supposed to be under 90? Or can I not aim for that goal since I'm a diabetic and is it unrealistic? When I was gestational diabetic I had to aim for under 90 fasting and under 120 for after meals; which I ended up on insulin while pregnant to do so. My Dad says he has to aim for 90 to 110 fasting and under 140 after meals. Does gender and age matter for what you aim for as well? I'm 34 and female; so not sure what my goals shoudl be. I'm taking 1500 mg of metformin with dinner every night. No insulin; at least not yet; hopefully not for many years since I'm young; well at least younger than my dad. The doctor wasn't much help. And the book I got with my tester said to aim for under 170 two hours after a meal. That seems really high to me.	2007	2008	107	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My face is red; hot and itchy - could this be due to Diabetes or the medication I am taking? Two years ago I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes. My cholesterol and blood pressure are both high (blood pressure has improved this week since my GP increased the Ramipril to 10mg and added Amlodipine 5mg). Does anyone else get a red face?	2008	2008	55	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I was just diagnoised having type 2 diabetes last Friday. My blood levels were at 345 after fasting. Doc put me on 500mg of metformin twice a day. I begin dieting Saturday. My sugar levels are dropping rapidly. Just after 3 days; about 30 minutes ago; my results were 132. This is 4 hours after eating lunch. My question is; is it normal for it to drop this quickly? Do I need to be concerned that it drops to low? Also; I was using the restroom up to 7 times a night before; and now just after 2 days on this medicine; I only went once the past 2 nights. Is this normal? Sorry with all the questions; but I am new to all of this. Thanks for any advice.	2011	2011	52	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband has adult type 2 diabetes. I took him to the hospital on friday night with an outer and inner ear infection. While there his blood sugar was in the 400s. It was brought down befor we left. I was told to keep a close eye on his levels and to follow up with his primary doctor. The soonest they can see him is the 8th. He just checked and his blood sugar is 452. He took his meds. (metformin and glipizide) What can we do? Should we go to the hospital?	2010	2010	29	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been on 2500 mg of Metformin for 13 years now due to being insulin resistant BC of Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Have been on several other medications for insulin resistance that did not work. The Metformin doesn't really work but works better than anything else I've ever been on. My sugar still runs 200 after fasting for 12 hours. Are there any tests that can be done to tell if you really need insulin? The only two other people in my family that were diabetic were my great grandmother one on my dads side and one on my moms and they were both insulin dependent.	2018	2018		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Well im new to the forum; this is actualy my first post. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes late summer last year; im 17 about to turn 18 soon. I started by monitering my diet and still I needed medication; so my doctor prescribed me with Glucophage XR 500mg; 2 pills a day taken at same time. They worked great; I never had a problem; then last month my glucophage was substituted with Metformin ER 500mg; same dosages; I noticed changes after about a week; my sugar was higher then it was on average with Glucophage; so I mentioned it to my mom; we kept monitering it; after about a month of being on it my blood sugar level was getting pretty high.. 2 hours after a normal sized meal(only 60-70 carbs) my bloodsugar was about 250-350; so we got the glucophage back finally; its been three days now and my blood sugar is still staying pretty high. What im wondering; is it common for this to happen? is it because of medication switching(ive heard that metformin is **** compared to glucophage)?.. Or maybe is my situation getting worse and my body isnt able to produce insulin as well as it was when I was first diagnosed? Thanks for the help; it is much appreciated; Michael	2004	2004

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My doctor put me on Metformin 500 milligrams. I have always been checking my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning and they always stayed between 100 + 108. I wanted to get my blood sugar levels below 100 but was unable to. That what is until I started using stevia in my diet. Stevia is an all natural sugar substitute which comes from a plant in South America. There are some studies out there( although the studies are limited) that shows Stevia has an effect on blood sugar in a positive way. I started using stevia for about 3 days now. For 2 days already my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning dropped to 94 and 95. Does stevia have anything to do with it? So far I think my research is inconclusive as I have not been using Stevia long enough to determine this. however I am watching this closely. Has anyone noticed a positive change in their blood sugar level using stevia?	2016	2016		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	[Im 31 and a Type 2 Diabetic (2 yrs.). I take Insulin and Metformin daily. My diabetes are uncontrollable and this year Ive had recurring yeast infections everyday. I scratch a lot & it got to the point of me shaving constantly to relieve my itch. It became a horrible habit. I never had a menstrual cycle in my entire life either if that helps. ] Last night; I had sex with my on and off boyfriend. Last time we had intercourse was a few weeks ago. Early this morning I developed a pimple on the inner left lip of my vagina. If touched; I experience a sharp pain on it. Later on today; that pimple morphed into a cluster. On camera it looks yellowish on the cluster. Its itchy and it hurts to wipe my vagina after using the bathroom. I went to the doctor immediately! However; although they stated it doesnt look like herpes; I still got tested and waiting for results. Im just afraid thats all.	2017	2017		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Thank you so much for answering my questions.I'm a 48 year old female. Along with the hypothyroid problem -I take metformin (500mg with meals)for insulin resistance. I was told it was 'borderline type II Diabetes'. So; would that be the problem then? If so how would I handle that? I've also had a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia -though a lot of the symptoms have eased (if not abated yet);since starting thyroid med. The only BP that I take is HCTZ diuretic(hydrochlorothiazide) 25mgs in the morning. Would you consider that aggressive enough treatment? I was prescribed Inderal initially; along with the diuretic. But it caused a problem with worsening hypothyroid symptoms;(blocks conversion of T4-T3)- so I was put on the Ace Inhibitor Altace (with HCTZ). After 2 weeks I was tested and showed a marked problem with creatinine levels. I wonder -if I'm only able to tolerate a diuretic (as it would appear) - whether a change to a stronger one like Lasix (Furosemide) might do some good in dropping the extreme BP spikes? Its good to know hypothyroid doesn't cause the BP problem. I'm wondering if levels of thyroid MEDICATION might - even though levels are presently optimized? BP readings done on multiple days. Thanks so much little0ne	2002	2002		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 60 year old female that was diagnosed with Type 2 about 7 years ago. I was on medication to control it but had reached a point to where I should start insulin. About 9 months ago due to finacial problems and I had to drop insurance etc..........my point being I had to quit all my meds (Metformin; Victoza; Cymbalta; Vytorin; Levothyroxin and Lisinopril). I try to watch my sweets and carbs; although I'm not always successful with it; and that is all I'm doing at this point. I have recently started experiencing pains in my legs; even so bad that they hurt to the touch; burning sensations (like sunburn) from middle of body to top of my head; itching when I try to sleep and lately headaches. These symptoms occur mostly at night. I've also have loss 58 lbs without trying. Could this be caused from the diabetes; can I be starting to have a stroke? Is there any OC meds I can take? Please if anyone has any advice; info etc. please tell me. I'm starting to get very concerned.	2011	2011		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My girlfriend has type 2 diabetes and has been unable to control her counts using insulin. Today; her readings are around 30 while taking 12 units of insulin at bedtime; and metformin (500 mg) six tablets per day (BLD) and glyburide (5mg) twice a day. Her specialist is sending her for ultra sound to explore her thyroid. The wait for ultrasound is four (4) weeks. What do you think is happening? Is there anything to be concerned about?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have just had an emg/nerve conduction study and the doctor was clearly biased. There are multiple symptoms that may point to something else. Yes.. I know that diabetes contributes to this... I am tired of being misdiagnosed at every turn in my life. Perhaps someone has some idea of how i should approach this? Or could someone suggest a test that might help? Maybe a list of the symptoms might help. I have spondolitis on the c5 vertebra and it's in the later stage. spondothesis on L4 a double spina biffia occulta on L5 diabetes type 2 auto accident in 2003 which resulted in a major injury to my arm with bruises on abdomen difficulty in swallowing dizzyness/ballance issues (new after accident... very good balance before) chronic edema over L4 area (emg/nerve conduction confirmed nerve damage there) extreme pain in feet pain in upper thorasic followed immediately by body jerk. when I was on metformin/glucophage; i had chronic (24x7) diarreah now that i am not on any meds for diabetes; i have chronic constipation. itchy back for two years (so that there are usually welts all over) butcher's broom herb; which is for circulation; helps more than anything else. a weak aortal valve that i was born with. (i was a premie) I am suspecting that one or more of three things are the culprit... damage to intestines from chronic (5 years) diarreah; circulation problems; malabsorption (diabetes related).

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with type II diabetes 3 months ago. I was started on byetta at the routine initial dose which was increased 2 months ago. I am only taking byetta; and no oral hypoglycemics (metformin; etc.)I have lost 29 lbs in that length of time; primarily due to decreased appetite; nausea; and vomiting. I understand that this is in all likelyhood due to delayed gastric emptying. My question: Is this ever going to get better??? All of the information I have read leads me to believe that it probably should have; but nope....no way....same ol'; same ol'.....shot; eat; nausea; vomiting. Repeat (excuse the pun) ad nauseam.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	hi was diagnosed last year with type 2 diabetes. think I had it for about 15/20 years before that as the consultant said I had prolific diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy in my feet which was signs that I had it for a while. anyway my blood sugars are now under control so why do I feel so ill. I was registered partially sighted in January this year and have regular laser treatment to stop further loss and I can cope with that. I feel tired all the time even though I have regular B12 injections and can not walk far without needing to rest and sit down. Also I go from constipation to having runs regularly. Constant indigestion and itchy skin on my back and legs now all round my mouth is red and sore. I have had quite a few dizzy spells (more feeling funny) with a headache after them. My appetite is poor but I have not lost weight although prior to diagnosis I lost loads. doctor said as my blood count was not bad 7.5 just come in 6months to see how I am then. is anyone else feeling so rough. my wife thinks I should go back before the next blood check as they are only looking at the diabetes not anything else.	2014	2014	69	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was wondering if anyone here has known of anyone who's secondary symptoms with diabetes have been relieved after discontinuing aspartame use? Since being diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic three years ago; I have; of course; dramatically increased my use of Aspartame; in that time I have developed depression; muscle aches; severe fatigue and gastro-intestinal problems; none of which can be diagnosed accurately. I've tried many medications and for these symptoms; in tandem and individually. I have never discontinued using aspartame; although I have considered it after reading a couple of the anti-aspartame websites that suggest some of my symptoms may be related to artificial sweeteners. I am aware that there is no official documentation of a link between aspartame/artificial sweeteners and the many maladies the anti-aspartame sites claim; but; as I said; I do wonder; and wanted to ask if anyone here had any information for me! Thank you; Gina.	2003	2003		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Well 3 months ago my A1C was 6.5 up from 6.03 months earlier; my doctor uped my medication from 50 mg metformin 2Xday to 1 and 1/2 gram 2Xday ( 3 times my regular dose). I am now having to feed the medication to keep my levels from dropping too low ( like 32 to 40). I am gaining weight and my new A1C was 7. I think that I am taking too high a dose; what do you think? I believe in my heart that this is too high a dose!!!! I spoke to my doctor and he says it's not to high. What do you think?? please help	2009	2009	48	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Years ago the drs told me I had type II diabetes. I'm talking 20 years ago. Lost a lot of weight and never heard anymore about it. I went to a new endocrinologist and had the sugar test done. My h1c test was perfect. I had to go back and do the sugar test. When I started the test fasting my sugar was 117. After drinking the sugar drink the first 30 minute blood test my sugar went to 195; then they took it again at the next 30 minutes and again at the 2 hr mark. My sugar at this time was 75 and they had to give me a sugar tablet to get my level up before I could leave. when I went back to talk to the dr he put me on metformine. since then I have not taken the meds. When I get up in the morning my sugar is between 77 and 90. After a regular meal and even drinking sweet tea my sugar never goes over 145. I don't understand diabetes at all I guess. I can't figure out why I would be put on medicine. Can anyone help explain to me what the reasoning would be. Thanks and God bless	2012	2012	45	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism for around 15 years now; as well as Sleep Apnea (7 yrs); and now Diabetes Type II (2 years). I have been under the care of my doctor all this time and prescribed thyroid medicine; metformin; and use the sleep apnea machine when I sleep. I get 7 or more hours of sleep a night and is usually restful. For the past 5 years or so I have noticed my energy levels decreasing quite rapidly. My doctor has played with my meds to keep them within the appropriate ranges and this never seems to help. I otherwise have a healthy checkup when I go in. All other blood work is in the norm; blood pressure is in the normal range. Last year I was diagnosed as having low testosterone. Less than 200. I started injections for about 6 months and my readings only came up to 330. Still feeling lethargic and no improvement the doctor stated my testosterone levels would not increase as they should have but didn't. So i stopped taking the injections as they didn't seem to be working. I don't know what else to do. I have suggested everything to my doctor to do things different. Even going to alternative doctors and such. He said those guys are for healthy patients and nothing they can do will improve what I'm already doing. So geez i'm out of ideas and am really tired of being tired and no energy. And when I mean no energy it's the type where you come home and have to lay down because you are just wasted sort of feeling. I would love to work out and be more active but you need energy to be energetic. Even when i was working out all the time in the last year I was still no more energetic then I am now. And I have no depression issues going on. Any ideas?	2009	2012	50	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 33 yrs old and have always been classified as pre-diabetic with fast glucose between 100-110. But that was several years ago. After my husband lost his job we went several years without insurance and medical care. Now two years later I finally started randomly checking blood sugar levels ( several family members are diabetic). My fasting sugars are 115-130 on 1000mg of metformin twice daily. I am on a strict diet with no sugar; low carbs; and no fat. I also lost 20 pounds so that I would no longer be overweight. THis has not helped. When I was originally placed on Metformin for PCOS and metabolic syndrome 3 yrs ago my blood sugar level was 110 with at least half of my diet consisting of chocolate and soda. So it is very frustrating that I am working so hard on this diet and still having high sugar levels. Last week I was craving chocolate so bad....so I had a hershey bar and a REAl coke...it tasted great but 3 hours later my blood sugar was around 250. I have a dr appt next week but am curios as to what they will say. Will I still be a pre-diabetic or does the higher sugar levels on increased metformin mean I am probably type II?	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm type 2 diabetic. I have been taking Metformin 500mg 1 tablet a day for the last 3 years. My A1C is in control (6.0). It appears that I am hitting so called ""dawn phenonmenon"" whenever I drink alcohol (just 1 drink). Before going to bed my blood sugar is about 110 whether I drink alcohol or not. But my fasting glucose is between 140 and 150 if I drink alcohol and it is from 115 to 125 if I don't consume any alcohol the previous night. In summary the dawn phenomenon is exasperated by alcohol. But every thing I am reading is against this. I'm wondering if any one has any logical explanation for this."	2008	2008		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have hypothyroidism and I have also been diagnosed with PCOS using labs and ultrasound on ovaries. I am still experiencing horrible fatigue and occasional tingling in my hands and feet. I had thought this was thyroid-related; but now I am wondering about insulin resistance. I am concerned since I have PCOS as well as relatives with type 2 diabetes. I asked my doctor about it and he said that my fasting-glucose levels have always been normal (in June it was 81); my non-fasting serum insulin was normal (level was 8); non-fasting c-peptide was normal (level was 2.9); so it isn’t an issue. I requested the 2hr GTT w/insulin check. He felt it was a waste of my time to get this test; but gave me the order to get it done anyway. I did that yesterday. 1) What would indicate insulin resistance with this test? I am considering switching doctors because I am not sure if the doc I am seeing is right for me. 2) Would a reproductive endocrinologist treat both PCOS and hypothyroidism or do they only treat people with issues in trying to get pregnant? 3) I have heard of many people with PCOS taking Glucophage. If this is a proper treatment for IR; is the extended release version better than the regular? Thanks for your help.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a single 30 y/o female. My sister was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease and I have struggled with my weight since I was younger and wanted to have both things tested. I am heavy-set with a BMI of 20% however my cholesterol levels are normal and my blood pressure is 120/70. I am extremely active (baseball/hockey/tennis/running) and exercise daily. I am most definitely not a late night or throughout the day snacker and I also am very cautious about what I eat and do not eat sugary foods (soda; candy; bakery items) and try to avoid pasta and bread (bagels; etc.) as often as possible. My only terrible habit is that most days I tend to go the entire day without eating - only eating a sensible and appropriate dinner when I get home from work. (I was always under the assumption that a person should eat only when they feel hungry) My doctor performed several blood tests and advised that the tests showed that my ""fasting"" blood test showed I had very high insulin levels. She has prescribed Metformin for me; however; I have been trying to find out exactly what this means to no avail. She has confirmed that I do not have diabetes but hasn't / can't give me a name for what it is I do have. I just want to know what this means as far as a diagnosis is concerned so that I can educate myself a little more and determine what lifestyle changes I have to make in order to deal with this illness. I have recently been forcing myself to eat several small sensible meals/snacks throughout the day to try and maintain a steady blood sugar level but don't even know if this is the right thing to do or not either. When I attempted to make an appointment with my current doctor to discuss this matter in more detail; she scheduled one six weeks from now so needless to say I am searching for a new doctor. I would like to be able to explain a little more about my condition to my new doctor however; which is why I would like someone's help in explaining what this condition is called and what exactly this all means."	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi everyone! I'm still kind of new at this so bear with me. My name is Misty and I am 23 years old. About 4 months ago; I was diagnosed with PCOS. I was also told that I had type 2 diabetes that is uually associated with it. I am currently taking metformin for the diabetes and my doctor said in the long run it would help with fertility. I have CRAZY periods!! I'm on it now; and have been on it since May 20th. They never stop! I have to go in frequently to check my blood count to make sure I don't need blood. I have tried depot; pills; more pills; ring; and patch with no success of making my period normal. I have recently had an IUD put in because my doctor thinks that it may stop my period. Has anyone done this? And if so; did you still bleed for 2 months after having it put in? I'm still new at knowing about PCOS and to be honest it scares me a little. I have no children and would love to have some one day. Thank you so much! Misty	2011	2011	23	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Dear Doctor.... My husband is Type 2 Diabetic and was diagnosed approx. 8 yrs ago. He is a 54 yr old African American male..and ever since I can remember....usually within an hour of his eating; he has loose stools. Matter of fact I don't ever recall that his stools are completely ""formed"" but not watery persay; either...Just LOOSE. They are never accompanied by cramps...bloating...pain...no obvious bleeding; neither bright red OR ""Coffee ground"". He is one of the rare diabetics who doesn't gain weight....but is very small framed; 5'6"" and 140 and he has maintained that weight ever since we have been married; going on 24 yrs. My question is...what could be the causes of him never having formed stools...and I know I cannot view this as a diagnosis...but I would like ideas of what to research as to what COULD cause this. He DOES take Glucophage; Amaryl and Zocor....and I understand the meds may cause diarrhea but I believe his occurances of loose stools began long before him taking meds for Diabetes and cholestrol. He is very compliant with his meds and his 3 montly CBCs always check out in the acceptable range. Thank you."	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I had to go to the ER in early May for severe abdominal pain that had me doubled over in pain on my living room floor vomiting into a towel because I could not get up and walk (much less run) to the bathroom. I have had this pain before but it had never become sooooo severe. It always started out mildly between the end of my rib cage and my belly button. It never moved to either side. the worse it became; it would slowly move down into my pelvic bones it seemed & would occasionally cause kind of a numbing feeling in my right leg or foot. SO I go to the ER & they do bloodwork; but no scans of any kind; hook me to an IV & hydrate me & give me pain meds. All they found in my blood work was that my blood sugar was ""a little"" elevated. They sent me home. I followed up the next day w/ my regular doc & he said the ""little"" elevation in my blood sugar was 220. (I had had a yearly checkup in February & my blood sugar was 96 at that time.) So he prescribes Metformin for me; gives me a diet pill ( i weighed 232); and some Nexium for the pain in my gut--he offered no diagnosis of THAT problem. He sent me for abdominal & pelvic ultrasounds--both came back normal. I've now lost 22 pounds. I've seen him a few times since (he took me off the Metformin-it was making me nauseous ALL the time & Nexium cuz it obviously wasn't helping my stomach pain) & then I had to go back in early July for that same pain again & he sent me for CT scan. I do not have those results yet; but in all of my research; I can't find any DEFINITIVE cause for the pain; but i do find A lot of things that scare me when I speculate as to what the pain COULD be. Any ideas or directions as to where I should go or what type of doc I need to see?"	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Type II. After a bad experience with Avandia; I'm starting on Lantus. My doctor's procedure is to stop taking Glucovance and to just be on Lantus; nothing else such as metformin. I am to keep increasing the Lantus until my levels are in the 180s. I am at 30 units of Lantus now; but my levels are all over the board depending on when I test. My doctor didn't say when to test and I think that would make a lot of difference. So; I am doing a fasting test in the morning and then test a few more times thru the day. Fasting levels are around 120 to 150. Other levels have been mostly in the 200s. I just wonder if it's standard to start on Lantus this way. It seems odd not to add in metformin or another oral med and then start adjustment depending on levels. I guess I am concerned about insulin resistance and the part that plays. If there is no metformin to allow the cells to be more permeable; then what is the good of just being on insulin? I guess I just don't see the logic of starting this way and am wondering if it's standard. My doctor says that Lantus dosage can get up to 60 or 70; but I've never heard of it that high. My family is rampant with diabetes and even 30 seems high. I'd appreciate some feedback.	2010	2010		Female

My doctor thinks I am only doing extremely low calories which I am but doesn't know the other. I have tried to stop but can't.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I 'm 66 and have had Type 2 diabetes for about 2 years; and hypertension for about 6; also raised cholesterol. My untreated BP was around 180-200/110-120 - so not good! Back in 2007 I was getting quite a bit of chest pain and was investigated; but with treatment my BP fell to around 115-130/65-80 and I had no problems. (At this time I was not diagnosed with diabetes. I have had a mild cardiac murmur since childhood; but this is considered insignificant. There is a strong history of hypertension - both parents had it severely; several aunts and cousins were hypertensive and died of heart problems. My father had several heart attacks from age 60 and died of left ventricular failure. My mother had congestive cardiac failure. Investigations in 2007 ECG Treadmill stress test Radio-isotope stress test - very slight narrowing of LAD; but considered insignificant Echocardiogram - mild left ventricular hypertrophy; presumably from BP Over the past couple of years my BP has been rising; with my diastolic consistently above 85; and I was surprised that my GP only made one change to my medication. This last couple of weeks the chest pain on exertion or stress has returned; sometimes radiating to my neck. Yesterday my BP was 145/95 and I asked if I could add propranolol - also for my essential tremor. I should like my BP to be below 130/80 as I have diabetes and a the above family history of heart disease. My cholesterol is slightly raised at around 5.5. I had to come off simvastatin because of muscle pain; and was changed to bezofibrate 400mg daily. I've not had a cholesterol reading since then. My blood glucose and HbA1c have been good. Current main medication: Adizem XL 120mg daily (diltiazem) Lisinopril 20mg daily Propranolol 40mg twice daily (added yesterday) Bezafibrate 400mg daily Metformin 500mg twice daily Isosorbide mononitrate 10mg daily; increasing to twice daily (from 5 days) GTN spray as required My GP was unsure whether to refer me again today; but we agreed to see how things go with the added medication and review in a month; or earlier if there is no improvement. Does this seem reasonable?	2007	2012	65	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Good afternoon. I have been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes for about 5 years now...I think I had the problem well before that but I had a doctor who would never run the test (just lose some weight; etc). I'm not very good about keeping my levels under control because I get so discouraged that I just give up from time to time. For example; 3 1/2 weeks ago now I was feeling very disoriented so I checked my sugar (please note that I had not been eating correctly or exercising but I was taking most of my medicine) and it was 458. Needless to say; this scared me straight. For the last 3 1/2 weeks; I haven't missed any of my medicine (Byetta 10(2 X per day); Metformin 500(1 X per day); Amaryl 4 mg (2 pills; 1 X per day)); I have exercised (real exercise; sweat and everything) for a minimum of 30 minutes every single day; I haven't eaten any sweets and have kept my carbs very low (lots of fish; egg whites; and cucumbers). I'm monitoring my sugar 4 times a day right now. My lowest reading was last week and it was 197; my 7 day average is 268; right now (just checked it) it is 325. I am currently without medical insurance and can't afford to go have a million tests run right now. I've called my doctor's office and asked about Novalog Mix 70/30; I was put on it after a brief hospital stay about 1 year ago and it's the only thing that has ever really dropped my blood sugar. I'm waiting to hear back from the doctor now. Another interesting thing is my blood sugar is always it's highest when I first wake up in the morning (well over 300 in the am). I've tried checking it in the middle of the night to make sure that it isn't dropping to low at night (I eat supper around 5:30 and don't eat again till breakfast) and it's usually just in the low 200's. I just wondered if you had any suggestions or ideas as to what my problem could be and what I could do to help bring this under control.	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm wondering if thyroid issues could be causing me to ""appear"" to be on the cusp of diabetes. I was having bouts of hypoglycemia that was extremely obvious; but until I had a glucose tollerance test was completely unaware that I was also having hyperglycemic episodes as well. I was diagnosed as ""prediabetic"" in October. My A1C was a consistent 5.9 until last week when it was 6.3. I have worked very hard at monitoring what I eat and the quantities that I eat. I've totally changed my choices in high calorie foods; opting for low fat; low sugar substitutes. I've given up a lot of foods that I really like for fear that there would just be no middle of the road with them for me. So you can imagine my surprise at the spike in my A1C. Even more scarey though is the way my TSH level has been fluctuating for more than a year and a half now. In January; it was 3.65. Last week it was 32.65. My current does of medication for my thyroid is .125 mcg which I am now taking 2 of every other day and 1 on days in between. Coincidentally enough; my blood sugar readings the past couple of days have been fantastic. Mostly 70's; 80's and 90's. Nothing that would support an A1C level of 6.3. My question.....Could something going on with my thyroid cause me to ""appear"" to be diabetic? For background history; both my parents were adult onset diabetics; my mother brittle. My mother also had a portion of her thyroid removed because of a diagnosis of Graves Disease. I myself have been on thyroid replacement therapy for more than 20 years. My sister (1 year older than I) has been on the same dose of thyroid .025 mcg since she began taking it. I began with .025 and have had increases and decreases in mcg's through out my history with this medication. Any help with this would be extremely appreciated. Thank you."	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 40 yr old female with a growing medical history. I feel like my body is falling apart and although under the care of SEVERAL physicians; I am feeling helpless. I am about 90 lbs overweight and have struggled loosing weight for years. Nothing I do works and each time I have gone to the doctor in the past their answer has been ""loose weight"". After years of stomach issues; I had my gallbladder removed in 2001 (HIDA scan showed it wasn't working). I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2003 (due to clotted periods and extreme hair growth on my face; neck and arms). I have been told I have IBS (but I feel that is a cop out for them not wanting to find the answers to my stomach issues). I had to have an epigastric hernia repair with mesh in 2007 due to 4 tears in my abdomen wall. I was told last summer (after years of bladder/kidney infections) that I have Stage 3 bladder prolapse and that it has also made my uterus fall (Stage 2) in which I still need to schedule surgery. Now recently (2 yrs ago) I have been diagnosed as hypothyroid and have increased my Synthroid does from 88mcg to 125mcg over that time. I was diagnosed at Type 2 diabetes (A1C at 7) about 6 weeks ago. Have issues with high cholesterol and elevated liver enzymes. I was referred to a new Gastroenterologist about a month ago; which ended up with more bloodwork; an abdominal ultrasound and an EGD/Colonoscopy. Results - BLOOD WORK - Inherited liver disease - NEGATIVE Ferritin - HIGH @ 272 ANA Direct - POSITIVE ABNORMAL @ <1 AST - HIGH @ 126 (was 100 the month before) ALT - HIGH @ 101 (was 87 the month before) ULTRASOUND - Liver - Diffuse increase echotexture. Enlarged. Right hepatic lobe sagittal measures 23 cm. No liver nodules or masses. Spleen - Homogeneous echotexture. Enlarged measuring 13.7 cm. Otherwise results were ""normal"" that I can tell. *Being referred to liver specialist and appt is Aug 23rd. EGD - Excess bile in stomach. Erythema; congestion and erosion in the antrum and pylorus compatible w/ gastritis (biospy). COLONOSCOPY - 1 polyp in ascending colon (biopsy). ** Had several polyps in same test 2 years before; benign. Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids. Random biopsies done due to chronic diarrhea including microscopic colitis (biopsy). My health issues keep growing and I keep feeling sicker and sicker. I have no appetite and am having to force myself to eat (barely getting 700-1000 calories if that a day) and still not hungry. Extreme fatigue to the point that I can barely get out of bed in the morning. All of this is making me extremely anxious and obsessing about what is going on. Need help and support on how to view all of this information."	2010	2010	39	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a type 2 diabetic; but am not; and never have been; overweight. It runs in my family; on both sides. My last A1C was 11. I take Invokana and Januvia. Since last month; I've changed my diet the best way I know how. I only have 1 starch a day; and that's a whole wheat starch; 1 serving of fruit; and the rest is veggies; nuts; and seeds. BUT; my readings are still high at times. What else can I do? I go back in another week for another A1C and I really want it to be better.	2016	2016		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hey ladies! I just found out today that I have PCOS! So; losing weight is going to be harder for me than I had hoped. It has always been hard for me to lose weight (now I know why) but I am considering the South Beach Diet. Anyone have good luck with that diet? I already work out; so now I just need to make sure my diet is in check. I have been counting calories and staying under 1300 but I don't think that is going to be most effective for me now that I know that i have severe PCOS. Doc told me that my testosterone level was high; even for a man!! So; as a woman; that didn't make me feel too great lol Anyways; just wanted to post and say UGH!!!!	2007	2008	21	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I am a 40 year old male and have had problems for the last 3 years. It started with pains in my stomach and back (right side); no pressure when urinating; and feeling dreadful (sick; dizzy). I was diagnosed last year with type 2 diabetes and have been on metformin for about a year. I still have the pains in my stomach (right side and sometimes down the front of my right leg) and no pressure when urinating; and I always have a rash on the glands of my penis. I also still feel unwell. I have had blood tests which only show a slightly high blood sugar; and any urine tests are clear. My doctor is no help and I have been to a urologist who says my bladder and prostate are OK and cannot give me any answers. I am beginning to feel that my life is over and will have these pains for the rest of my life. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.	2011	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	So i'm suffering from Headaches that won't go away by pain relivers like Paracetamol ; Dizziness and black out's when standing up ; Eyes pain and sensitivity to light ; Short term memory loss ; difficulties in talking ; Loss of concentration ; Hearing problems and Tinnitus ; Balancing problems; and changes in my mood and personality like GAD ; MDD {Was talking Zoloft and Lexapro} ....... 5 months ago i went to neurotologist and he ordered a CT Scan ; Came out clear and said that everything is ok ..... My question is ; Could a CT Scan detect small tumors ? Like MRI ? What should i do now ? Ps: I'm type 1 diabetic ; Taking insulin and Metformin and my last A1c is 6.3 which is great ; I'm diabetic since march this year... And most of the symptoms i mentioned above are 1.5 years old	2010	2011	22	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. I am a 40 year old male; 190 lbs; active and on low carb diet; who has been on insulin NPH BID 25 units for the past 2 years. Prior to that I took oral medications only(all sorts; metformin; avandia; etc..) In October of last year my A1C was at 6.3. Adjusting my insulin levels seemed to have no effect on my fasting blood gloucose level (typically in 130 range). August of last year I was put on Tricor and added Diovan 160 in Novemeber; and have always been taking 1000mg of metformin twice a day. Since November my blood sugar has become unmanagable (fasting in 150+ range). Recently I stopped taking Diovan; because I noticed that it appeared that this whole thing started after i took Diovan. I tested my blood sugar and my mornings results for two days were in the 130s and went up to 150 again; so I went back on Diovan per my doctor's insistence. Then my doctor suggested about two weeks ago that I switch to Lantus (My A1c is at 7.2 now). I did that and no change. I tried adjusting the amount; almost up to 50 a day; no change. Yesterday he suggested that I inject Lantus U-100 twice a day. I am getting super frustrated with this whole deal. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.	2004	2004		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My RE has been running tests to rule out why I'm having m/c's. Well the Nurse called back yesterday and said HCG is now ""-"" and that they got the results from my fasting blood work. Shows that my glucose is normal; but my insulin is high. I've never had issues with this and the nurse told me ""there's a first time for everything""...which didn't sit well with me; but that's beside the point. They told me I have to exercise more; eat healthier (which isn't a problem; because my husband is a Type I diabetic; so we eat healthy); and start taking Glucophage (Generic Name: Metformin). I asked how long and she told me I'd be on it while I'm a patient with them and maybe after that. How can you have normal glucose and high insulin? Do they not work together? I'm just shocked because I've never been boarderline or anything until now. I thought maybe I had ""gestational diabetes"" and that's why it was high; but with my HCG being normal; that wouldn't be from that...would it? They wouldn't even let me exercise and wait on the medication. I'm not one that likes to use medication when I don't necessarily need to. I'm just confused and wondered it anyone had any insight they could share."	2006	2008	27	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Not so much a question as general venting and any imput is welcome! I'm 26 and found out that I had PCOS at 19 after losing 100 pounds to join the Army (which was done all the wrong ways). Once I got in the Army I couldn't maintain my weight. Had doctor appointment after doctor appointment. I knew that I starved myself to get in; but couldnt understand why I coudnt keep it off. After 1 year and facing being kicked out of the Army; I finally made them send me off post to an endocronologist where they discovered I had PCOS. I'm still in the Army; still overweight; and still dealing w/ the Army not happy with my fatness. I've been on metformin on and off since being diagnosed. I HATE taking it b/c it makes me sick. My body never got use to it. Lowering the dosage does help; but still vomit and/or have diahrrea if my diet isn't 100%. I basically do not take it anymore. I'm also on birth control to help w/ having a period. Which it had always kept me regular; but the past 6 months; that has all changed. At first they were just starting early.. then late.. and now; it's been 3 months; and I know I'm not pregnant b/c I'm not sexually active. I have doctor appoints lined but; but not for another month. I finally got to my largest ever at 310 in January. that was an eye opener. I got a personal trainer and started weight watchers. But; weight watchers actually put weight on me b/c that was WAY more food than I ate before. So; I quit that and start just my own calorie limitations. So; I have lost some weight; but it has taken me 8 months to lose 40 pounds!!! Sure; 5 pounds a month doesn't sound too bad I guess. but; I workout twice a day (all cardio; even the weight training) and eat 1000-1200 calories a day!!! I know; that isn't ""enough"" but if I eat more than 1200 calories; I start to gain weight. yes; my body hates me! I would love to get under 200 since I'm deploying overseas next year and I really don't want to be fat in the desert for my safety and everyone elses! The past 2 monrhs; my weight has platued eventhough I'm still doing the same things if not more. So.... FRUSTERATED!! I though w/ weight loss PCOS should get better! Mine just seems to be getting worse... :( Thanks for listening!"	2009	2009	25	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I arrived at the ER with a blood sugar of 558 mg/dl. I was given 10 units of insulin via IV and was sent home two hours later with a BS of 228 mg/dl. I'm taking 1000 mg of Metformin every twelve hours but I can't get my sugar below 250 mg/dl. I've been eating two boil eggs and one slice of wheat bread with butter for breakfast and chicken salads with no dressing for lunch and dinner yet I can't get my bs below 250 mg/dl. Am I doing something wrong? why can't I get my bs in the 100's?	2014	2016	32	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Is there any correlation between elevated Alt and insulin resistance??? I found out in January of 2013 (almost 1 year ago); that I am insulin resistant. I received my blood tests results; and I am worried. My ALT is elevated. Prior to this it has always been in the normal range...I have recent blood work results from August; May; and January of 2013 to compare it to. What could this mean? It was my Endocrinologist who ran the blood work. I see him every 3 months because I am insulin resistant (not diabetic). He didn't even mention the elevated ALT...but I saw it once I received the faxed results. I also noticed that although my AST and ALK Phosphate are within the normal range; they are definitely a bit higher now than in August & January. Could this mean something? I do have my blood tests for the last few years all the way back to 2007 and my ALT has always been in the range of 12-20 and my AST in the range of 13-15 and my ALK Phosphate in the range of 52-68. Here are the most recent results... November 2013 ALT 47 ""high"" (normal range 6-40) AST 24 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 86 (normal range 33-115) August 2013 ALT 19 (normal range 6-40) AST 13 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 66 (normal range 33-115) January 2013 ALT 17 (normal range 6-40) AST 14 (normal range 10-30) ALK Phosphate 63 (normal range 33-115) I do not drink; I do not smoke; I only take Tylenol or Advil if I have a bad headache.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi - after trying various treatments to shake a four month cough (and about a month of shortness of breath now); my primary doctor thinks it might be related to excess fluids and a potential heart condition. I had an echo; which showed that my heart is enlarged and my ef is only around 15%. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 6 weeks ago (my ac1 was 13+) and I'm obese. However; my bp is normally around 118/80 and I just got my lipid panel back: 102 total cholestrol; 89 triglycerides. My good cholestrol is a little low; but not so much as to be a worry. I'm also very low on vitamin D. My glucose this morning was 160 and so while I'm not in range just yet; it's been steadily dropping with metformin and junuvia. I'm being scheduled for a stress test to see what else might be going on with my heart. My question is with good diabetic control and weight loss can an enlarged heart and dismal ef be reversed to the point of not needing medicine but monitoring instead? I'm a 45 year old female. Thank you for any advice!	2012	2012		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Off-topic perhaps; then again it is a risk sx of tx and rescue meds so perhaps not; it just seems to get better and better. Fasting blood lab today shows Glucose and Lipid panel showing numbers in the diabetic range! Not only does tx sometimes fail; but it seems to also make a bad situation worse. Just thought I'd share another page from my anecdotal life with HCV and it's chemotherapy as something for folks to consider when looking at whether to treat or not.\ I do have a predisposition from family on fathers side and tried to watch closely while on tx; but the few times I could convince; or remember in the brain fog; to have tests run; all seemed copacetic. But being a nonresponder; seems response is go away and come back in 6 months. Until the re-check; your on your own pal!	2006	2007	48	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband has been diabetic for 6 years. His tratment has been metformin 850g tablets. He also has high blood pressure; and takes coversyl 4mg. For the past coulpe of months he has not been feeling himself. He had some blood results which confirmed his medication was no longer controllong his condition. Also his LFT result was 307!! He has now been told he has to stop all his medication - until he has an urgent ultrasound - and we are waiting to get an emerency appointment with his diabetic specialist. I am concerned that he is on no medication at all. But ultimatelly our concerns are with the liver results. What could have caused this?? And can the damage be treated?? Is it likely that he will be put on insulin now??	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	A month and half ago i began experiencing strange movement in my entire abdomen; i ve been pregnant before and it reminds me of a full term baby rolling around in there. I recognized that these are not my normal gas cramps or bloating. I have felt very bloated; lots of belching as soon as i eat; but can be belchy any time. Doc said cramps and bloating could be from diverticulitis and treated me with cipro and flagyl; when no change i went to er. They did ct without contrast and bloodwork and said i had mild diverticulosis and to finish antbiotics. Went back again when cramps; bloating didnt go away; this time they did a pelvic ultrasound and upper right quadrant ultrasound to check lixvliver; pancreas and gallbladder. Only found sludge in gallbladder. Sent me home with more pain meds. I wejt back again when i started to feel the cramping in my stomache and esophagus. They did chest xray; which was normal; ekg normal; and then admitted me for a colonoscopy and egd; both normal with only mild reddening of stomache so then sent home witha gastritis diagnosis. They put me on bentyl; fibercon caps. I ve been having some pain when swallowing food; and cramping of tummy shortly after eating; but egd was normal and so was colonoscopy; wondering why i still have these rolling cramps and bloating and what could this all be? Im on gerd meds protonix and carafate; but havent always been faithful to take them daily. Im diabetic type 2; on metformin 1500 a day and levoxyl due to thyroidectomy 10 yrs ago. All bloodwork and tests have been normal including two cardiolite heart tests.	2013	2013	39	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I went to doctor to be referred to a specialist to find out why my legs go numb and why my back hurts all the time. Have had many many tests in the last 6-8 months and they have found a bulging disc and degenerative disc disease; and spinal stenosis. Anyhow the NP decided to do a complete blood workup. It came back and my A1C was 6... a year ago it was 5.5. She wants to put me on metformin right away and i refuse. I have done finger sticks almost daily for the last couple of weeks and my morning sugar (usually after coffee w/creamer) is between 86-98. I just do not see how after ONE report coming back high they would want to stuff me full of medication. I would say monitor sugar; and retest. Is this the right thing or should i start putting prescription meds into my body that i may not need. Also my triglycerides were a little high; LDC was a little low. And Vitamin D was low. I am overweight; and have been trying to get a referral for weight loss surgery. This NP said that if i don't take the medication then she will make sure that i do not get approved for the surgery.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi Doc; you are a great help to many. Thanks for your support. For about 8 weeks I have been experiencing a sensation on my arms (mainly left elbow area); shoulders; and occassionally my right arm. It feels like mild sunburn. There is no rash or discoloration. Occassionally; it itches; but not acutely. I have been treated for anxiety with lexapro and lorazepam for this period; and am taking meds for diabetes type 2 (metformin; lisinopril; tricor). I had a possible HIV exposure about one year ago; tested negative in May (well outside of window period)...so I don't think that is an issue. But; I am concerned; because I have never experienced this before. In addition; yesterday I discovered a small circular purplish spot (about .10 of an inch) on my penis shaft; topside; near the base. It is flat; not painful (unless I rub it hard; and then it is like raw skin); and a surprise. My doctor has no clue. He feels sure it is not a lesion that is due to STD; but cannot say what it is. I have an appointment with a dermatologist; but it is a few weeks away; so I needed some insight now. Thanks for any help you can give. Any ideas about my skin and that spot.	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Both parents; and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110. It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent for investigation. I had an echocardiogram which showed definite; although slight; left ventricular hypertrophy; and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time. I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan. The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD; but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared. My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg. In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I eat a healthy diet; although overweight (but losing); and it is well-controlled on Metformin. However this; and the family history; mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80; which it was not; and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice daily A month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain; similar to that in 2006; although not radiating; worse on exertion; but sometimes present at rest. My GP would like me to have further investigations. The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above. Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN; which is very rare for me. This relieved it instantly; which would point to angina; and I took my evening medication. Before the GTN; my BP was 170/108; which is higher than it has been for over five years; although I am consistent in my medication. Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.	2007	2012	65	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm not sure if this concerns with diabetes; but it's somewhere to start because I have no idea what is wrong with me. I am unable to see a doctor until next week and I'd like opinions on what might be the problem. Anything I eat; I mean anything (fruits; rice; bread; candy; nuts; anything) it causes me to do into a slightly air-headed dizzy state. Sorta like when you're slightly drunk. I can still concentrate but not as well as I should. Now this happens seconds after I eat anything; and no matter how small I eat. For example the other day I ate about 4 nuts and instantly got this dizzy sensation. It's been going on for about a week now and I'm really worried about this. I am a 20 year old male; who is active in sport; eat normally and is in the right weight.	2011	2011		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed June 2007 with Hypothyroidism. Just recently im getting the symptoms all over again.. cant get enough energy to workout; sleepy all the time; gaining weight. I was able to get down to 173 then now im way back up to 182-183 and i even got down to 179 by working out a couple of times and then next time i wanted to work out my body just isnt letting me and even tho i did the treadmill on sunday and i weight 179.4.. and on Tuesday when i was gonna workout again; i weighed 181.6 and this morning 182.8. Could it be that my medicine has stopped working? Do i gotta push myself even harder with the work outs. I recently lost 50lbs; was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes the same day as hypothyroidism and was told my cholesterol was slightly raised; and im only 21. Funny when i weighed 230lbs; i was healthy felt fine; lost the weight; and now i got all these problems. But now i gotta lose so that i can get healthier like when i was fat. jk.. i know being obese made me get these problems. So anyways.. Thyroid medicine.. how long does it take for your body to need the medicine adjusted again???	2008	2008	21	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Dear Doctor; I am a 37 year old woman; 5'0 115 lbs. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ( I know physically I do not fit the mold; bad genetics) after several years of dodging it. I have three children and with all three pregnancies I had gestational diabetes and was on insulin all three times from the beginning of my pregnancies. I have tried Metformin 1000 mg a day it makes me extremely ill. Switched to Actos; felt great; then started having chest pain and twitching feeling in heart; switched to glipizide 5mg kept having severe drops in blood sugar dropping to 50 at one point; i am not a big eater prefer small meals throughout the day and i have a good diet; switched back to and currently taking metformin trying half pills throughout the day still same issue feel like i have the stomach flu everyday; my numbers are sort of all over the place; with my fastings are the most troublesome always on the high side 130-195. I am very sensitive to almost all meds and tend to just suffer with pain etc.; instead of taking medsm however; i realize i do need diabetes med. can't go untreated. (Big Picture) I have suffered from anxiety and migraines most of my adult life. In recent years (past 5) I have been suffering from widespread muscular pain (myofacial pain syndrome) according to rheumatologist; cannot sit or stand for very long without pain in neck and back; have difficulty holding a pen or typing due to pain in hands and wrists; ankles and tops of feet hurt; wake up with pain all over; chronic fatigue; shortness of breath; dizzines; ringing in my ears; eye pain; occasional numbness and tingling in my hands and feet; hot flashes; memory loss; difficulty with attention span and word recall difficulty. Not sure how this relates but; I had my tsh checked several months and had a low tsh with normal t3 and t4. It was re-checked and they were all normal. I insisted on having it checked again due to recent extreme fatigue;so tired it hurts...and new levels are as follows: last cholesteral 196 last a1c 5.8 iron slightly low tsh .25 t3 2.96 t4 1.01 ultrasound results: mildly heterogenous in echotexture without sonographically detectable focal lesions. right lobe 4.5x1.9x1.7cm; left lobe 3.4x1.4x1.5c.;isthmus is normal in calibur 3mm; no evidence of adenopathy; no extrathyroidal mass identified.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in March of this year. My A1C was 7.8. I was given Metformin to take 2x Daily. They told me they wanted my fasting blood sugar to be 70 - 110; but I can't remember what they told me the range should be 2 hours after eating. I am only suppose to check my blood sugars once a day so I try to do it at a different time every day and I just can't remember what they told me what they should be after eating. Oh; and my A1C was down to 6.3 when they retested it in June. Thank You	2012	2012	56	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I hope someone can help me. For 10 days now I've been experiencing coldness which started from my feet-ankles-legs- thighs; then traveled to buttocks arms --face--head --mouth-ears and nose. I have been having sharp; burning pain in feet. (Thats where the pain started) I only have pain in feet. I went to see my doctor: she gave me blood tests--A1C 6.8; THyroid normal; and Toxoplasmosis test did come in yet. I have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. My cat has Toxoplasmosis and is being treated for it. Do you think I have Diabetes Neuropathy? Doctor isn't sure yet. I at times breakout in sweats ( sugar is at good Range). My body Temp was 96.4 for a little while; then went up to 97.7; it does go up to 98.6. Even my tongue gets cold. The coldness is causing me to sneeze alot and loose sleep. I am scared. If my body is cold; does it mean that it's loosing oxygen? Circulation? I have had nerve damage before from surgery in both feet. And I have 2 herniated disk and a cervical buldging disk. ( Due to a fall.). I can feel my feet; no numbness now. Prior to them becoming cold they did at times feel numb in certain spots. i have to sleep sitting up or I will get colder. My doctor doesn't think that I should go to the ER. Thank you	2008	2008	43	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 41 year old female. I am 5'2"" and weigh approximately 196 pounds. (I realize I am overweight; however; I have been unable to lose weight for some reason). About three and half months ago; I was hospitalized due to chest pain and difficulty breathing. I have been diagnosed with type II diabetes for 6 years now. I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and high tryglicerides at the same time. I was diagnosed with hypertension; depression and anxiety about 2 years ago. I have been on multiple medications for diabetes from oral to insulin (for a short period of time i.e.; 1 year); as well; I have been on multiple medications to treat the high cholesterol; high tryglicerides hypertension and depression. Due these complications; I had to leave my job. My current medical regime is Actos; Metformin; Avalide; Lipitor; Lexapro and Lorazepam (prn). At the time I was hospitalized; I was diagnosed with low potassium levels. I had a stress test completed as well as some sort of nuclear medicine test to examine my heart (sorry; I don't know the type of test; I just know it had something to do with radioactive dye). These tests were all normal. Since this time; I have been sick off and on. It is beginning to cause serious problems in my life to where I am not finding answers to the causes of the symptoms I am having. Recently; I was extremely ill and am currently not feeling much better. I have had a poor appetite; nausea; some diarrhea; extreme fatigue; hot and cold sweats; blurry vision; dizziness; deleria; anxiety; poor response to stress levels; lethargy; extreme pain in my legs and feet; numbness and tingling in my arms and hands I went to my physician and he had know explanation for why my blood sugar levels were high; my blood pressure was elevated despite taking medications. He sent me to the emergency room for iv fluids. Prior to becoming ill most recently; I was retaining water badly. I assumed this was bloating from my pending menstrual cycle. When I went to the emergency room; I was given iv fluids and potassium again. My blood sugar levels have been over 200 and at times beyond 275; despite my poor appetite and at times inability to eat due to nausea. My blood pressure has been elevated despite the use of medications to treat the conditions. I was referred to see an endocrinologist and at this time; paperwork for my referral has to be reviewed to determine if I can be seen by the endocrinologist (as I only have a low income type medical insurance for use at the local university/community hospital). My question is; what would cause the above symptoms to include the low potassium levels; higher blodd pressure and high blood sugar levels? Please help someone; I am so frustrated and exhausted with the lack of answers. Anyone that can help or give me some answers would be greatly appreciated. Prissy825"	2008	2008	41	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I became infected with hepatitus c back in 1995. I did have a liver biopsy in 98. Now about 2 months ago I was taken to hospital because of diabetes and they found out I had a fatty liver and they claimed they tested my blood NO HEP C found. I was told I had NASH which is NON alcoholic liver disease. I had a biopsy done these are the results. Could HEP C have done this even though it cleared itself? I was told in 98 after a biopsy that I had mild to moderate inflammation in my liver. Biopsy is somewhat fragmented; but it appears to have at least some fibrous expansion of portal tracts; possibly with fibrous bridging. Definitive changes of cirrhosis are NOT evident; however; there is marked macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis involving 70-80 % of the liver parenchyma; without a specific distrubution. Neutrophils are few; but lymphoctes are noted and hepatocyte ballooning is evident. Hemosiderosis is absent as demonstrated by an iron stain and eosinophilic globules typical of alpha -1-antitrysin deficiency are not observed on PASD staining.	2010	2010	46	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 52 year old white male; genotype 2. I have completed 19 of 24 week pegasysus+ribasphere 1200 milligrams/day treatment. I have experienced hypothyroidism; and I started taking Levothyroxine 0.05mg/one a day on Jan.24. I sprained my hand and the doctor gave me Naproxen 500mg/one twice a day; and I took this med Feb. 2 and 3. On Feb. 4; I felt stomach pain and nausea all day at work; and had diarrhea beginning Feb. 4 at night; and have had this plus terrible stomach pain and gurgling ever since. Doc had me start on Prilosec OTC for 6 weeks; and discontinue the Naproxen on Feb.5 as well as Immodium but have had no relief from diarrhea or stomach pain yet. I was unable to take either ribasphere or Levothyroxine on Feb. 5. Doctor insinuated that the 2 days of Naproxen could be source of my stomach problems; and could have caused an ulcer; which Prilosec is to treat. I was undetectable at week 12; and my Jan.27 labwork indicated the following exceptions: WBC 2.6 Normal 4.0-10.5 RDW 15.3 Normal 11.7-15 Mono 14.0 Normal 4-13 Neutrophils(ABS) 1.4 Normal 1.8-7.8 Glucose 103 Normal 65-99 ALT 59 Normal 0-55 I should say that I work in a hospital; and know that I could have picked up a virus; but did not have any fever. Due to this diarrhea and painful stomach; I am thinking I cannot make myself take the ribasphere for the remainder weeks. Has anyone else had this stomach pain and what remedies did you have?	2008	2009	53	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; I am new here. I have been anxiety ridden for 2 years after my first episode of severe tacchycardia . After my stress/echo which caught my heart rate at well over 200bpm and seeing 2 EP doctor's they were not too concerned and said it was not the dangerous type..""atrial tacchycardia"". They said I could just live with it ""it would not kill me""; or they would do an ablation if I got tired of it because it will not go away. I am afraid to live since I never know when the bull will want out of my chest. Has anyone chosen to live with this or is an abation the only solution...scary!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed 6 months ago and at that time my A1C was 7.7 and at this months follow up it was up to 9.9 so I'm just wondering what to think about all this and what I need to do. I'm 59 years old; about 50 pounds over weight; down about 21 lbs this year. I exercise daily and will need to work more on my diet. Just increased to 1;000 mg metformin in yesterday's appointment. I'm interested in what your thoughts are on the best way to get the numbers down. Thanks!	2006	2017	58	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I started taking 500mg metforming twice a day this past Wednesday. I'm wondering how long before I start seeing lower glucose levels. My average so far is 322; highest 375 and lowest 330. I might add that I am also taking Sutant for renal cell carcinoma; Hyzar and norvesc for high blood pressure. A side effect of Sutant is a shut down of my thyroid consequently I am also taking synthroid.	2009	2009	63	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am having a hard time finding stuff on the Internet so I thought I'd just ask about peoples' experiences. If you have PCOS and take Metformin; do you have side effects? Does it help you lose weight? The reason I ask is because apparently PCOS can affect your ability to lose weight which is something I've been struggling with. I was 135 lbs pre-babies and I have FIFTY lbs to lose to get back to that weight. I'm 5'3"" so it is VERY important I get down to that weight for my health because 135 lbs is the higher end of how much weight someone of that height should be. I'm just hoping that if I have to take this that it'll be beneficial on that end as well. AND... is there anyone else out there who just has high testosterone and want to chat with me?"	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed June 5; 2007. My eyes were always very good until 2003 i started needing glasses and forever they pretty much stayed as bad as they have been til i was diagnosed. My doc sent me to get my eyes checked when i was diagnosed; doc told me no blood vessels popped but needed major correction. I never got glasses so now more then a year later my eyes are really bad; seems every month for sure they are getting worse. I use to have trouble reading far; like a billboard with small letters. But now even seeing 3 feet in front of me looking at the calendar across my desk is where squinting wont even let me read it. My sugar has been out of control for past 2-3 months because i just havent had a chance to get to the doc.. last time i went my A1c was 7.5 from 8.1 so it went down but i know its gone back up because during the last month i've gotten 300-400's and thats with taking 1000mg of metformin twice daily; 45mg actos once daily and taking 12units of Lantus in the Morning and 8 at night. My doctor gave me humalog for fast acting but its not in the pen form like Lantus; and i dont have access to a fridge everytime im gonna eat. so i never do it. I wanna ask him for the Humalog pen i've even printed out a free trial coupon to go with the prescription. But im scared to go because i know he'll be upset i didnt go sooner. SO i got 2 questions. #1: Do you think i could have Type 1 instead of Type 2 cause how could i progress so fast in not even 2 years yet; going from great control with just the metformin to poor control with so much; i've heard type 2s go to insulin but over 20 years not 2. And im only 22 and weigh 176; i've lost 20 pounds since diagnosed. So shouldnt i be needing less insulin not more if im a true type 2? #2: Could my eyes go this bad this fast from my sugar; am i looking at blindness at a young age? Sorry for rambling..	2008	2009	22	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I'm a 33 year old who until 2 weeks ago didn't know he was apparently quite severely type 2 diabetic. My A1C was 10.1%; and my fasting (20 hours) blood glucose was 12.6 (227 for my US friends). Long story short; my Dr told me I was pretty screwed; and started me on 2000mg of metformin (to ramp up to over 20 days); and said if there isn't major improvement in a month I go on insulin; and then sent me on my way. It seemed like a good idea for me to monitor my blood glucose; so I went and bought a meter; and started testing at least 4 times a day (wake; before dinner; after dinner; and before sleep) just to try to learn how my body reacts to everything. But that's where things start to get weird; because what I'm seeing doesn't seem to match anything that others have said to expect. Here is a typical day for me Wake (fasting about 11 hours): 12.6 (227) Before dinner (fasting 5-6 hours) 10.8 (195) 1 Hour after dinner 10.2 (184) 2 Hours after dinner 10.2 (184) Before bed 10.2 (184) It doesn't seem to matter if I eat nothing but leaf lettuce for 2 days; or try a high fiber cereal or a piece of fruit with lunch; my blood sugar gravitates to 10.2 like its trying to maintain that. Eating seems to make my BG drop just slightly; and I never seem to get a post meal spike. The worst thing I can do is stop eating.. the longer I fast; the higher my BG goes. I've seen this patter every day since I started testing 16 days ago. Is this just a sign that my body went too long with undiagnosed diabetes; my pancreas is dead; and I need insulin? Are these BG levels a patter of an insulin dependent type 2 diabetic that isn't on insulin? If eating doesn't increase my BG; would insulin not be dangerous? Anyone with any insight; I would really appreciate your comments. Thanks!	2013	2013		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello! We have been ttc for over a year now and I'm seeing an RE ( I have endo-severe; and my husband has very poor morphology 2% strict criteria). I went in for an ultrasound today and they said that my ovaries look ""borderline"" polycystic with 10-20 follicles on each (I'm on day 4 of my cycle). I have regular periods every 30 days; and NO other symptoms whatsoever. Can you make a diagnosis of PCO or PCOS just by ultrasound(this is my second one someone has mentioned this)? If so; If I am making a mature follicle every month is there a benifit to going on metformin as well; or will this further affect my fertility? I have used an OPK a couple of times late in my cycle (the last week of it) and had a positive OPK (LH surge) could that also add to the diagnosis of PCO? thank you for any help!"	2007	2008		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 a few years ago. Last year my vision was blurred and my glucose was in the 500s; so they put me on Victoza. It worked like a charm; felt better right away. Now I am in the ""donut-hole"" in my insurance and so it now costs $400 whereas before it was $40. So naturally I had to stop using it and just use the Metformin. I have exhausted my resources for getting free samples of Victoza from my diabetes educator. Now every morning my fingers on both of my hands are so asleep and stiff that I cannot use them. Throughout the day it gets better but still tingles. About every week my left thigh becomes all of a sudden numb and tingly. What should I do? I checked my glucose is normal. What are these symptoms? I am 50 years old.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I was diagnosed with type 2 many years ago but I was in denial. Now I can see ignoring my condition was just about the dumbest thing I could have done. I do take metformin 2x per day but that is about all I do. I am at least 100 pounds overweight have pain from neuropathy and feel tired all the time. When I say ""all the time"" I mean from the moment I wake up in the morning I could go back to sleep. I was given gaba something for pain but it does not work. I take a low dose pain pill only at night which seems to help but not always. My doctor want me to consider having gastric sleeve surgery (claims it will improve all of my numbers to include blood pressure). I guess my question is .... is it normal to be this tired and sleepy all the time? Is it my blood sugar that is causing this? Should I consider gastric sleeve surgery?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi everyone. My name is Pete and I'm new to the site/forum. I recently had a company-paid-for wellness screening. They did an array of blood tests and I wasn't too thrilled with the results. The most distressing of the batch was my Hemoglobin A1c...which was 11%...Some background: I'm 28 years old and have been fairly healthy. My blood pressure has been borderline and in the past year I've lost about 28 pounds and are down to around 264 now. I try to eat fairly well and only really eat out maybe once or twice a week. I don't get too much exercise besides what I do at work; (which involves a lot of walking around but nothing too athletic really). My father is a Type-II diabetic who got his when he was something like 48 years old. Neither my brother; sister or mother have it but I know diabetes runs in my father's side of the family. Needless to say I'm kind of freaking out a little bit because I really don't want to go down the road of having to take insulin or becoming a full-blown insulin-dependent diabetic. What can i do to lower my A1c levels???	2010	2010	27	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	i have been trying to get pregnant now for about 8 months I found out that i have PCOS; i started off taking clomid then had a HSG test done everything came back normal no blockage then i started taking Femera got pregnant ended up in a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. The very next month i got pregnant again but it ended up being an eptopic pregnancy. this broke my heart; 2 days ago they did an emergency lapascopy surgery which ended up with them removing my left fallopian tube. I still have both my overies and my right fallopian tube what do you think my chances of concieving will be only having one falopian tube and pcos. My periods were never very normal and as you know i already had a little bit of trouble getting pregnant in the first place.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 41 year old female with a history of hard to control hypertension (currently on four meds for this). I also have type II diabetes; although it is under control with metformin. I have recently been diagnosed with silent strokes; according to an MRI. There appear to be about 5-6 white matter lesions that the neurologist believes is related to this. A VEP was normal. He also dx me with complicated migraines and periphreal neuropathy (balance problems). Here are my questions: 1) Can they tell; from the MRI; how old the silent strokes are? 2) How low does my BP need to be in order to avoid future silent strokes? 3) My BP does not run sky high; but marginally high. Could this cause silent strokes? 4) Does the brain ""recover"" from silent strokes? Will the white matter lesions go away? 5) Aren't I quite young to have had this number of silent strokes? What should I expect in the future? 6) I have had some episodes of mental confusion and my cognitive abilities seem to be a bit diminished (my typing speed and accuracy have dropped; for example). Could this be from the silent strokes? Can this come and go; or will it only get worse? 7) The doctor put me on 325 mg of aspirin to avoid future silent strokes. The aspirin causes great problems with already heavy menstrual periods. Are there any other ways to help avoid future silent strokes? 8)In the future; when I fill out medical forms; do I indicate that I have had a stroke? Or not? Are silent strokes considered actual strokes? Thank you very much for your time; Ramona"	2002	2003		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	About 3 months ago my husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Recently he started having a lot of joint pain. Now his ankles and feet are swelling. His sugar levels are doing great. We have been to the doctor and he has had several test done. Everything is coming back good. Has anyone had these same symptoms? He is taking Metformin and I am wondering if this has anything to do with this.	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I prepared the following write-up as a reference and introduction for when and how insulin should be started:- This write-up is for general information and should not replace the advice of your Dr. Please working closely with your Dr. for appropriate treatment of diabetes. Insulin should be used by any person who is not consistently achieving target blood sugar goals with lifestyle measures and 1 – 2 oral medications. Persons with Type 1 or Type 1.5 (both of which are autoimmune) should use insulin either alone or in combination with appropriate insulin sensitisers (usually metformin) if there is insulin resistance. So what should blood sugar goals be? These are very individual; but should be formulated with consideration that truly normal blood sugars in people who are non-diabetic would consist of fasting blood sugars typically in the low 80s; and post eating blood sugars that rarely if ever exceed 100 (and then not by much). A truly non-diabetic HbA1c is in the 4s. (Bernstein says 4.3 – 4.6). Consider also that diabetic complications (eye; circulatory; nervous system damage) are known to start occurring when blood sugars are consistently over 100; and the rate of complications increase markedly with blood sugars over 140. Complications are also known to increase exponentially with every 1% rise in HbA1c over 5.0 . I personally believe that optimal target blood sugars should be those recommended for pregnancy:- 80 – 120 (target fasting < 95; 1.5 – 2 hrs post eating < 120); and never over 140. An optimal HBa1c in the low to mid 5 range. This can be a pretty tough target to achieve and takes the right tools; knowledge; and skills; taking a combination of lifestyle measures (diet and exercise) and medication (correct timing; carb counting; etc). As a cautionary note though; such “tight” control may not be appropriate for everyone. However; ADA and other agencies do recommend that HbA1c below 6.5 should be targeted for most people. Insulin should then be used to keep blood sugars as close as possible to non-diabetic blood sugars; but while also avoiding low blood sugar. Insulin should also be used with careful and frequent testing to determine blood sugar patterns and to ensure that highs are treated appropriately and lows are avoided. When starting insulin; there are 3 options:- 1. Add a long acting insulin (once or twice a day) to normalize base insulin levels. This is particularly appropriate if fasting blood sugars are high; but post eating levels are ‘normal’. 2. Add a short acting insulin before meals (or before selected meals) to prevent post meal highs. This is appropriate if fasting insulin is normal but blood sugars go high after eating. It may also be used only for selected meals; if there are only some meals / foods that cause problems. 3. Add both a long acting and a short acting insulin. Initial doses may be very low (even 1/2 to 1 unit is still a valid dose) in cases where insulin is started early while pancreas is still working to some extent. This approach supports the pancreas so it can work comfortably within its remaining capacity (and hopefully will stay working for longer); while preventing the havoc that continually high blood sugars can bring. When adjusting insulin; start low and go slow. Test frequently; particularly when making changes / taking up exercise and work closely with your Dr. or qualified diabetes educator. Diabetes doesn’t cause complications! High Blood Sugar (from uncontrolled diabetes) causes complications.	2007	2013	42	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My mother is 59 years old. No hx of colon cancer in our family; although her father had benign colon polyps in his 70s. No history of any kind of cancer in family. My Mother is healthy except for high bp and type 2 diabetes. She is on bp med; metformin; 1 aspirin per day and i cant remember what other meds. She has been on this medifast diet for about maybe 5 years. She eats this medifast ""food"" and then a salad and chicken for dinner. She is very much a wine-drinker. So anyway; for several years she says that sometimes when straining; she passes blood with stool. Assumed it was a hemorrhoid so paid no attention to it. Just occasional blood in stool. In the past few months; there is more blood with stool and she has mostly diarrhea when she goes. Not a lot of formed stools now. OK so about a month ago; there started to be small amounts of mucous with the stool (and still blood). Now in the past 2 weeks; the blood and mucous are even more volume. and it is every time. She says sometimes she will feel like she has to poop; and goes poop and it is only a lot of blood-tinged mucous and nothing else. Straight pooping mucous. Over a month ago the doctor told her that she has no occult blood IN the stool. So the blood is coming out only when pooping or diarrhea. Blood does not leak out any other time. Only when poop. She has no fever. NO pain whatsoever; no fatigue; same appetite and otherwise feels normal. No pain at all. No weakness. But is very concerned about the large amounts of mucous now and blood; especially increasing over the past 2 weeks. Does this sound like cancer or what does it sound like? She has a colonoscopy scheduled for 4 days from now - but we are all terrified."	2008	2013	40	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	On July 13; my husband had fasting bloodwork done at his cardiologist's office. On Tuesday; July 20; he was told his blood sugar was 312. He doesn't go back to see the doctor until this coming Tuesday; July 27. I'm very concerned - he is taking nothing to control his blood sugar; so will it continue to climb? He has not been diagnosed diabetic (I assume that's coming this Tuesday!); but there is a family history )both parents; aunts; cousins). He's not feeling well at all - no energy; sleepy; pain in his legs all the time. Is it safe to wait until his doctor's appointment or should I take him to the ER? I'm very worried.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	After 6 months of watching diet for diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes; I started taking Meformin. Right before I started taking Metformin; headaches began. They are very frequent; sharp on the right side; feel pressure throughout temple-eyes-ears; have one spot middle of back of head that sort of tingles most of the time - very annoying at night; headaches are horrible when getting up from sitting position and coughing; Alieve helps in about an hour but don't want to become dependent on any over the counter medicine; would rather know the cause and work on that. I have been driving quite a bit (5000 miles each month) in different climates so I have not ruled out sinus headaches - they just don't have a rhyme or reason to when they start or stop. Lying down at night is hard to find a position; sometimes starts a headache. Mornings are typically very good - headache starting afternoon most days. Worried about secondary brain cancer and primary brain cancer or some other disease such as meningitis. Neck is stiff on both sides and also has sharp pain from time to time which also starts a headache. Eyes feel pressure; throat feels thick. I do have a goiter and have been on thyroid medicine for about 30 years - have it checked regularly. Nothing else has changed. Anyone have any ideas or know how to rule out some things;. I don't even know which doctor type to see. Thanks...	2010	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have infertility and miscarriage issues; so after discussing my issues with a doctor I work for; he ran ordered some blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound to look for PCOS.

TSH came back as 7.38 and I am now on Synthroid 0.075 mg. I am also on Metformin 2000 mg qd; started about 8 months ago for a slightly elevated fasting insulin level.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 53 year old male diabetic and have been on insulin for the last 25 years. My current A1C is 7.5 . My average daily insulin requirement is about 80 units A recent test showed the following results: GAD - AB < 5 IU / mL C-Peptide 2.6 ng/ml I had fasted overnight for the tests. In addition to diabetes; I also have radiation induced Hypothyroidism and take 125 mcg of Synthroid. I also have heart disease with EF of 30%. Had CABG (2 vessels) 10 years ago and have an implanted defibrillator. My recent lipid readings are HDL 37 mg/dL Triglycerides 62 mg/dL LDL 80 mg/dL Total Cholesterol 133 mg/dL I take Crestor (20 mg) and Trilipix (135 mg) to control lipids. I also take metaprolol (100 mg) ; Lissinopril ( 10 mg); aspirin ( 85 mg) and Effient (10 mg) That was my background history; now the questions. 1. Since my C-Peptide and GAD-AB indicate that I am not Type I diabetic; was it a mistake of my Drs to put me on insulin ? After diagnosis I was on diet therapy for 5 years and then on oral medication for only 1 MONTH followed by insulin 2. If I am Type II; then would a combination of insulin and oral medication work better in my case ? Thanks.	2007	2012	51	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello again and thanks for your feedback. I have to clarify my results because I missed something in the interpretation from MMOL to mg/dl. My four readings are as follows: based on a 12 hr fast 2000- 85 2002- 90 2003- 106 2004- 115 2004- 85 Now I am confused - are these readings bad? My Dr said that because both my parents were diagnosed w/ Diabetis type 2 at age 50 and 55 I am at increased risk of getting it. He said to be careful and reduce my weight by 10 lbs and watch the sugars and things should be ok or at least I could prevent the onset for now. I am 39 and male all cholesteral results are normal and BP is very good. What do I make of this? Also are glucose monitors accurate? I bought one and reads at 85 (fasted 8 hrs)?	2004	2004

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	really would like your opinion please...I have been hypothyroid for 15 yrs. I have been unstable for the last 8 yrs. The doctors have changed my dosing every 2 months as my levels are outrageous. My last TSH was high at 13.0 and my T3 was 0.02 and my T4 was low (indicative of hyperthyroidism). The doctor is running several tests including a thryoid u/s. I have had abnormal weight gain in the last 2 months (30 lbs; and I have had gastric bypass). The doctors are puzzled as to why I cannot get regulated. My exam on Thurs my doc said my heart was skipping beats and I guess he felt nodules because he told me get the u/s asap. Any thoughts? We are all at our wits end here. I was on 250 mcg of Levothyroxine then lowered to 200 and now at 175. This is all within the last yr and 1/2. My tests are still all over the place. Sheri1963 08/26/07 I was dx'd with Hashi's awhile back; so still not sure what is going on with me. I also get EXTREME hot flashes; shakes flushed and woozy with palpitations.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been having trouble with my blood sugar numbers. My doctor asked that I come in and see the CNP. I did as requested and she along with my consent agreed to start me on Lantus. I have tried the Januvia; Actos; Byetta; etc and none of those have helped. We agreed that if my mealtime numbers continued to be high that we would use a bolus insulin such as Novolog. I contacted her and she was going to call in the Novolog. My numbers have remained high and I am begining to worry about long term effects. The physician decided that this was not the best course of treatment and stopped the script. I waited for an hour at the pharmacy. I called the next morning and we kind of had issues. She said that I want to play physician and that the numbers of her diabetic patients are some of the best in the city. Maybe I need a new doctor she says. She agreed to give me Starlix. I have been taking this for two days now and I do not see a difference. My question is what could her concern be for me to not take the Novolog? She stated weight gain. Although from what I read about Starlix a main side effect is weight gain. Why did she send me to her nurse practioner and then not trust her opinion? I am currently looking for another doctor. There is a wonderful endocrinologist that I am trying to see but he is not taking new patients at the moment. I have another patient of his trying to get me the hookup. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	2010	2013	47	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was curious if anyone has had any experience with blood sugar problems as a result of Hep C. I have been noticing that sometimes after I eat (especially lunch for some reason) that I seem to crash. I get real tired where I take a nap at work sometimes. I have read that hep C can cause blood sugar abnormalities. There is a history of Diabetes in my family (brother and father) and I am about 30 lbs overweight so it could be that. I am going to schedule a test with my doctor. I've had them in years past and been fine but i am wondering if it could be from the hep c. Anyone else ever experience this?	2006	2006		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	hello; I am 51 years old from bahrain; I discovered since 2 years that i have diabetic type 2. I never went to a doctor but I have a glucose meter and i always; i check my sugar it is mostly around 6;8 to 9;5 but some times it gos to 11 and rarly to 12 melli mole. my hba1c is 6.1%. i mostly take care about my diet but some times i ignore it. my weight is 92 kg. and i am 172 cm tall. i normaly take herbs like zater or diabetic water made in bahrain. do you advice me to take insulin?. This discussion is related to How do i lower my hemoglobin A1c?.	2010	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am having trouble keeping my blood sugar in control. I will confess that I have not been dilligent with my diet and exercise. My latest A1c was 7.3. I am taking 850 mg of Metformin twice a day. My morning blood sugar is around 200. I am close to or over 200 for most of the day as well. I have decided that until I can lose weight and get my numbers in control that way that insulin might be a good choice for me. I am afraid that it constantly being that high is going to cause damage. I have tried other medications such as Actos and Januvia but they did not make that big a difference. I tried the Byetta as well with the same results. So I am not afraid of needles or injections. My question would be which insulin pens would be my best choice? I think a long acting such as Lantus and I might need a rapid acting one for meals? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I am going to see the nurse practioner today in my doctor's office. I also am a member on the Thyroid boards with having Hashimoto's disease as well. Thanks in advance for your help.	2010	2013	47	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My doctor thinks I may have metabolic syndrome. He is doing a multitude of blood testing. I am awaiting the results. The last blood work in February from another doctor was fine except triglycerides and total cholesterol were high and B12 was 195; low; glucose 90 which was normal. With my symptoms I have been having he is doing more testing. He is going to do another complete workup with blood testing and this time test my insulin level fasting along with CMP; thyroid; CBC; B12; can't remember what else. He feels that even though my glucose was normal my insulin may be high. Question is; if my insulin is high is that insulin resistance? Can I be on my way to Type II diabetes if I am resistant? I have not had a glucose tolerance test done yet? Should I consider that if the insulin level comes back abnormal? I have studies diabetes in nursing school but if you have ever been to nursing school you know they go through different diseases so fast and you actually learn just the basics of every disease. I don't have anybody that I can think of that has diabetes in my family either so I am not that familiar with diabetes. I would just like some advice from people who deal with diabetes and what to ask my doctor just in case my insulin levels are abnormal; like what kind of extra blood test would help. He is just a small town country doctor in a very small town and I am not saying anything bad about him but I know big city docs see more than these small town docs. And lets face it. docs see so many patients a day and they are so busy that sometimes they can forget to order a certain test that can help identify the problem. I am sorry to ramble it is just that I have been healthy all my life except for mild gastrointestinal symptoms. I have always been very athletic and now I am 34 years old; (not very old to be falling apart); I have arthritis in several joints; probably due to all the gymnastics; basketball and track and all the pounding I have put on my joints; I was recently diagnosed with adenomatous polyps which they told me were the precancerous type that they removed (my grandmother had cancerous polyps removed before her death; death due to her female cancer coming back and spreading all over her body); hips have bursitis in them; I get steroid injections in my right shoulder by my doc due to impingement syndrome but refuse a MRI for right now; he wants to check for a rotator cuff tear (work for orthopedics; so they keep trying to get me to get injections in my hips but I don't won't them to see my fat hips); I am overweight for the first time in my life by 30-35 lbs (my mother is severely overweight so I am fighting my overweight problem now before it gets way out of hand). And for the past couple of years I have been extremely fatigued and have no energy; thinning hair(not too bad); very dry skin (which I have never had). My doc I have gotten two B12 shots so far and that is helping me feel better but still not quite there. So there is my story; sorry to ramble but just had to get it all out there. Noboby understands how I feel and my husband just thinks I am a hypochondriac; but he hates going to doctors. Any advice would be appreciated or just someone telling me I know how you feel I am in the same boat.	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi everyone; I accidently came across this forum when actually looking for another topic. I am glad this is here and that I see some familiar names from other boards I frequent. :-) I haven't been diagnosed with an adrenal disorder; but I believe it is not far off from happening. I have a big round of testing coming up (can't remember them all... I'll find the list and post it). In the mean time; I was hoping someone could help me control my symptoms. First my background and current diagnosises: Prolactinoma - Cabergonline .5 mg weekly Hashimotos - Levothyroxine 75 mcg daily High Blood Pressure and super fast heart rate - some medication that starts with an N. :-P Depression/Anxiety - Lexapro 10 mg daily Vitamin D Definancy - 2000 iu daily PCOS/Type 2 diabetes - Metformin I have flank pain in times of slight/severe stress (used to only be when it was severe; but now it's anytime I feel even nervous or defensive). Drastic mood changes; nausea & diarreha worst in the morning and gradually gets better through the day; night time I have the most energy; sleep disturbances; thirst; salt craving; dizziness; weight gain that won't stop!; etc. Any help or suggestions on how to make myself feel better would be great! Also could any of my diagnosises be related to each other and if so is there a treatment I could do that could really help me out tremendously instead of treating them one by one? Thank you; Sarah	2008	2009	30	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My father has type 2 diabetes and has been on several medications which did not lower his BS. Metformin caused problems with his kidneys; gilp izide which bottomed out his blood sugar and he ended up in the ER. He was started on Januvia and Actos which helped but my mom was worried about the bladder cancer scare with actos so the doctor discontinued the actos. She gave us some samples of Victoza and he has been on Januvia and Victoza for several months and it has worked well and we are happy with the combination. Yesterday we called the pharmacy to see if his RX for Januvia was ready for pick up he said the insurance has denied the claim. Dad has Humanna Gold; so I called them and they said that when the Victoza was added ther combination threw up a safety alert because they are both in the same class. I called his doctor and she said that they act on the liver in a similar action but that those medications are commonly given together with good results. So I called the insurance company and they said they put me on hold and came back and said they would review it and to call back in 24 hours. The doctor called me back to tell me they called her and told her that they were going to deny the claim due to duplicate drugs. She said she has documentation to show that this combination works for my dad where no others did and she would send it to them. His response was ""I am not interested."" My question is how much power does the insurance company have to interfear with the physician and the client? Is there a state or federal insurance commission that oversees the conduct of the insurance company? The decision to deny this claim could not have been reviewed by a board of physicians while I was put on hold on the phone. The person who called dads doctor was not a doctor and he denied the claim on the spot. What can we do?"	2012	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 57 year old woman with Type II diabetes. I've also been diagnosed with HepC several years ago and was non-responsive to the Interferon/Riboviron regimen. The treatment made me very ill and I experienced very debilitating depression. Since that treatment; I've noticed how my forearms bruise and cut easily. I don't heal like I used to. I started juicing almost a year ago; avoid GMO foods; I eat more fish; lots of vegetables and drink lots of water. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. I quit all that 20 years ago. Had 6 children. I've been training for a Marathon and have been enjoying the challenges and the results too. I've been able to maintain close to normal glucose levels without Metformin; and I test 3 - 4 times a day. The skin on my legs look good; my face and hair; but when I look at my forearms I want to cry. I use special makeup to cover it up. It's just my forearms. Seems I never see them without the ugly bruises; scars & cuts. Why is this happening to me? My kidney function was normal; It's the first time in years my blood tests came back normal. My A1C was slightly elevated; but down from 10.4 to 6.9. Am I vitamin deficient? This discussion is related to marks/bruises that don't heal.	2014	2014		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Dear All; A year back i had a std infection; which remained untreated for quite some time. In march; 2014 i got the complete treatment and the blood tests and urine tests confirms the same. However; my doctor pointed out that there was some sugar in my urine; so i got tested for Blood sugar; and have been diagnosed for type 2 diabetes. My doctor prescribed me Metformin (1500 mg daily). While i started taking the medicine; after a few weeks; i started feeling stiffness in my fingers in the morning. it gradually has spread to other joints and bones as well in a few weeks time. i regularly feel week and lazy. also i have noticed white tongue since last couple of weeks and have been taking fluconazole 150 mg for last 10 days...although no benefit. fearing that it might be rheumatoid arthritis i got a panel test done. the test results shows everyting in the range. (except uric acid which is although in range but on a higher side of 6.5 and blood platelete on a lower side of 155) Please help me to understand why am i getting these joint pains.... I have also attached my test results....please someone help me on this....	2014	2014		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband is getting to the end of the road and is getting nowhere with the hospital and doctor saying they don't know what the problem is and don't know what to do. Diagnosis Undertaken: Ultrasound of liver & kidneys Scope into intestines & bowel Blood tests General checks Symptoms: When on no medication he is unable to tolerate food; he is sick after eating and ends up with severe abdominal pain. More Information: He has been on Orlistat for 3 years which relieved all the stomach pains but it has weakened the lining of the rectum and he now gets long term fissures whilst taking it and it cannot be prescribed longer than 3 years so he has no choice but to come off it. When off it he gets the symptoms above. The pain has meant he is unable to hold down a job and he is now suffering depression from the ongoing pain and affect on his life.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi to all I finnally have gotten around to to ask why endo put me on metformin with and average reading of 105? I called my sis because my brother-in-law is diabetic. His blood sugar was over 360. I have been seeing this endo for almost 2 years for my throidlessness. I do not trust him any more as I am not diabetic. I feel he is out to more insurance money from Tricare the military insurance. I did take the metformn for about 2 weeks and I felt no different.I still had 105 averages.The highest it ever read was 134 after a pasta dinner. I am getting rid of the endo. I dont take the metformin.I am not diabetic. I am turning over all my medical issues over to my primary care doc at the base I am throidless; bi polar and I am not diabetic. Thanks for reading this. I felt like I just need to talk with others that have more experience with diabetes I do worry about getting diabetes as my paternal grandmother and my father both developed type II. ao I am watching my diet and loosing weight.I stopped drinking sodas diet and regular and I have dropped from198 to 185 in 2 weeks.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My Husband just told me two days ago that he has diabetes. He's 48 and just slightly overweight- this was quite a surprise to us. He had a fasting glucose of ~300 and A1C of 7.8. He was put on metformin 500 1x/day. I guess I'm having a tough time really understanding what he's going through right now. We were just married in January and he's 18 years older than I am. We have had a few discussions about what this means for our lifestyle and how he feels about this. The only feeling I get from him is that he feels he's letting me down by not being as healthy as he thought he was. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to best support him in these early weeks/months?	2009	2010		Female

Rheumatic fever at age 10 (1987) suffering from endocarditis and arthritic knees; ankles; wrists and elbows; recovery took 3 months. At age 14 (1991) diagnosed with Tricuspid Valve leaf out of sync; 1 leaf opening and closing after other 2; resulting in orthostatic hypotension and loss of vision for around 10-15 seconds per episode. Advised by cardiologist that unless symptoms became disabling I should leave alone and see if I ""grow out of it"" and perhaps in adult life may require attention as and when. Echocardiogram tests performed in 2007 showed no regurgitation and normal ECG; despite minor pain on exertion; GNT discontinued due to headache associated with use; activity levels reduced to compensate. Now aged 35 I am experiencing palpitations and shortness of breathe at rest which is exacerbated during rest from exertion; very mild chest pain (similar to tooth ache) upon exertion rising to collarbone and left shoulder. Admitted to hospital ( 2 days ago) for 24 hours observation following mild tachycardia (135bpm) and very high blood pressure (180/120) at GP appointment. During observation ECG normal; pulse rate did not go below 115; BP lowest 140/102; negative for MI protein. Treadmill stress test duration 4 mins 55 seconds (average I'm told is 11 mins) BP highest at test 220/165; Pulse 165; Lowest 195/145; Pulse 130; ECG throughout normal; although when I took a peak there were some pauses between beats wider than others; similar to what I've researched to be arrhythmia. Consultant recommends Angiogram to determine cause of pain. Is it normal for tricuspid valve behavior to change or has something been missed on a previous Echo ? Anything else I should be asking to be done ? Thanks"	2012	2012	34	Male

I knew I hadn't been feeling well and having loose stools accompanied with stomach cramps 3-4 times a day but gaining weight rapidly which is what urged me to go to the dr. for testing. I am 29 years old; 5'1"" and 145 lbs. My typically weight is no more than 110... so this jump in weight is a HUGE deal! Anyhow... the last few weeks when something causes sudden stress... maybe an arguement or for instance yesterday I was working with police detectives on a sting to find a person who broke into my car and stole a lot of things... Normally when I have something that causes very sudden stress; I can feel my face and ears redden; heart rate increase; senses heightened and a bit jittery. Normal; I'd pressume. The last 2 instances of sudden stress after all those initial things happen... I have been getting a horrible aching; stabbing pain in the area of my kidneys. Both. This seems odd to me. Today; I am still feeling aches in my kidney's but also in the area that my right overy would be located. The frontal pain was bad enough to fully wake me when I tried to sit up a tad to see over my husband this morning to look at the clock. Any ideas?????? (PS. I also posted this question in the diabetes forum)"	2008	2008	29	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband had what we thought was a Heart Attack last week; when we got to the hospital & they did some test; they told us he has Aneuresym's in his Arteries of his heart & that there is severe placque build up. They sent us home the next day too see his new Cardiologist in 2 weeks as well as blood thinner (baby asprin; High Cholesterol meds; rest; etc). What can we expect from this & is this a common thing?All his friends say we need a 2nd opinion; but feel like we haven't even got to talk to his doctor & received all the answers to our questions. Can someone please ease my mind a little?	2012	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I had my A1C tested the other day right at my doctor's office - it was almost an ""instant read"" type of thing - nurse put the sample in a machine and had the reading in about 5 minutes. (I have no idea what type of machine i twas though; sorry). She said my A1c was good - it was a 6. What is the ""normal"" range for an A1C? I've recently been diagnosed with T2. My initial glucose test (not the A1C) was listed as high on teh sheet from the lab; however; my doc said it was actually in the borderline area (I can't find the actuall lab report to give you exact numbers). Anyway; he prescribed me a monitor to test at home; as well as put me on Metformin and Glimeperide. He actually gave me the monitor a month before putting me on the meds. during the month that I was testing; but was not on any meds; my sugar levels were pretty irratic - lowest was 88 and highest was 263 - during this month I also ended up coming down with a horrible case of bronchitis and severe asthma attack; so did end up on antibiotics; cough meds; as well as a steroid shot; oral steroids and a steroid inhaler as well as my ""normal"" ventolin inhaler and albuterol nebulizer. At any rate; the strange thing (or strange to me) is that my highest sugar numbers actually occurred BEFORE I was put on the steroids rather than after being on them. I know they can and do affect your blood sugar (unfortunatley have had to be on them many times in my life so I'm pretty familiar with their side effects) - but this time it seemed my blood sugars actually became somewhat more regulated while I was on the meds. Since being on the Metformin and Glimeperide; my numbers (I think) have been pretty good. My first am reading (before any food or drink) has been running between 85-103 and post-meal (2 hours after) haven't gotten any higher than 150. I have; however; had a couple of instances of lower blood sugars that have left me feeling quite shaky; headachy; etc. - lowest being 67 and I most definitely KNEW my blood sugar was low then - I drank some juice and it came up to a point where I felt better. Doc has now increased the Metformin from 500mg twice daily to 1000 mg twice daily; but has left the Glimepiride at 1mg once daily (that low blood sugar reading was before the metformin had been incrased) Does my A1C number sound correct? Does the increase in metformin; but staying the same wiht the other med seem logical since my numbers had already come down with the lower dose of metformin and I had had a couple of instances of low blood sugar that caused symptoms? I'm completely new to all this blood sugar testing; T2; etc.; so I'm tryin gto gather all information I can to make this ""transition"" easier on myself and also so maybe I can know more of what is ""normal"" to feel/expect and what are some things to be on teh look out for. The informational sheets that you get from the pharmacy with your meds are great; but getting first hand information from others I think is even better. Thank you!"	2009	2011	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	What would cause my husband's blood sugar levels to always be high? We discovered he was diabetic 2 1/2 years ago when he had a very; very severe pancreatic attack. Taken by ambulance to the hospital and stayed in ER for about 8 hours. When we returned home; it was only 20 minutes before we were in the car rushing to the hospital again. This time they kept him for 2 weeks. Ok; thats the history. Now I would like to know about these high numbers. He has even gotten as high as almost hitting 400. His average is 220 to 320. It's been a long time since he had too low of numbers and that only happened a few times. He takes metformin and tricor for the diabetes; as well as several other medications such as methadone (for pain); vicodin (only occationally) and ativan for anxiety. He gets blood tests about every 4 months; but the doctor doesn't seem to care very much to resolve this. He only goes to our family doctor because the specialist is an hour away and we just can't afford the gas. Are these constant high numbers dangerous; or could they be 'his normal'?	2010	2010	55	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Has anyone heard of PGX? Its apparently a natural supplement that works very well with diabetic people and insulin resistant people. I talked to a woman who said her husband has type 2 diabetes. They had him on metformin but it gave him too many side effects; so now he is on PGX and he has lost weight and feels great! this stuff apparently lowers the GI of the foods you eat; and allows your body to process it slower so that you dont get hungry as fast and crave food constantly! Has anyone tried it? Is anyone on metformin who needs to get off of it because of unwanted side effects? Fill me in!	2008	2008	21	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My mother (75yrs) is having surgery tomorrow morning (bilateral mastectomy); it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently; over the last couple of weeks her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis; particularly when taken just before/after surgery. My concerns: - is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery? - What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high? - When (at what blood count) does it an emergency? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi I am 29 year old female with PCOS I have been on Metformin for a little over a year. Initially the metformin caused some hypoglycemia and I had to eat often and check my blood glucose. The Hypoglycemia lasted roughly about 3 months while I adjusted to the Metfromin and since have not had any issues. I started loosing weight at the end of February; begining of March. I like most with PCOS had an extremely difficult time loosing weight for years and I had my weight checked at my routine Endo. appt. on February 22nd I weighed 186. Starting in March I began having swollen lymph nodes in my neck (worst in the back of my neck) and severe fatigue the Dr. told me it was mono (which I have already had before in highschool) and to rest and I would feel better in a few weeks. I have had a major amount of symptoms that have gotten worse and worse with a drastic loss in weight without doing a single work out; I am too tired to exercise anyway. I am currently weighing in at 143lbs and began getting very sick last week. Shaking; dibilitating nausea; Complete lack or drive to eat anything; low drops in heart rate wear my heart feels weird as it beats ( in the 60s); Severe diareah; headaches and I am still expierencing neck swelling; pain and back ache. I went into my GP last friday who decided to check my blood suagr and it was 61. This was most concerning cause I drank a 20 oz Orange juice about an hour before the appointment. He felt like my metformin was causing a random hypoglycemic reaction out of the blue? He also felt like my thyroid was enlarged and my neck appeared swollen. He ordered some blood work and another ultrsound of my thyroid ( my last one a year ago said slightly enlarged 1 yr ago with a small nodule; they planned on just watching it every 6 mo) my thyroid bloodwork came normal. I told him of all the symptoms and he suggested I make an appointment with my endo. quick. He pulled me off of my metformin for 3 days and there was no change in symptoms he also had me eat every two hours and check my blood glucose every two hours. I am having significant drops within two hours after eating anything at all. the symptoms are just getting worse. My endo said he thinks something is wrong with my adrenal gland? He said it sounds like this ""reactive hypoglycemia"" is caused by a possible case of addisons. I did a 24 hour urine test yesterday and turned it in today along with like 12 viles of bloodwork requested by my endo so I wont have labs for a cpl days. I should get my thyroid ultrasound back today or tomorrow. They said it has grown since last year and the radiologist is comparing the size difference I also have multiple new cysts growing on my thyroid but again bloodwork is normal??? As soon as I get all my new labs and urin study I will post them as well should be in the next couple days... I am hoping someone can tell me whats going on I have never felt so terrible and i am scared about how low I am dropping in blood glucose... Thanks in advance!! Symptoms extreme weightloss with out any exersize SEVERE nausea Severe fatigue throat swelling and pain (mainly the back of the neck) Headaches back pain diareah EXTREME lack of desire to eat; not hungry at all (but I am forcing myself too every 2 hours) attack of reactive hypoglcemia Low heart rate(when glucose is low it is in the 60's) or rapid speeding heart rate ( when my glucose is above 90) My fasting glucose has been around 70 once I eat ( anything) it goes up to 104 at the mos;t and then within 2 hours from eating it is in the 40s and I feel violently ill and super dizzy.... Lost need any answers I have never had diabetes or anything like that!"	2009	2012	4	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Dr. Schiano; Well; I'll start with telling you a little about my health. I've type 2 diabetes; high cholesterol; high trig. (hereditary on mother's side). I was just diagnosed with Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Due to the diabetes and high cholesterol I was taking metformin 500 mg.'s once a day and lipitor 10 mg.'s once a day for about 6 yrs. now. I've now been taken off the medicine's now due to high liver enzymes. I was diagnosed with a fatty liver in 2008. I feel like I'm falling apart; the unknown is the worse. Anyhow; I just had a ultrasound done on my liver; pancreas; aorta and right kidney due to high liver enzymes. I had a attack about 4 yrs. ago with pain under my left breast that radiated around my left side in my back and shoulder area. Never did find out why. However; since that attack; I've to take beano before eating veggies and gas-x at times; or I've a discomfort. Unfortunately; I never did receive a diagnose as to what happened. Ok; so now; I will list my high liver enzymes: 3/24/12- Alanine Aminotransferase 59 U/L High 0-55 7/5/12-Aspartate Aminotransferase 57 U/L High 5-34 7/5/12-Alanine Aminotransferase 100 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/11/12-Aspartate 60 U/L High 5-34 Aminotransferase Alanine Aminotransferase 114 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/19/2012-Aspartate Aminotransferase 56 U/L High 5-34 Alanine Aminotransferase 118 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 Ok; so I'm told it's probably from the generic of lipitor; per the pharmacist the generic has the same ingredients as lipitor. She doesn't agree. Anyhow; I'm thinking the same because I've been off the lipitor since 7/6/12; and my enzymes are still climbing expect -Aspartate Aminotransferase did drop a little still not in normal range. Could the cause of my liver enzymes be because of the Hashi's? if so; is it dangerous to have high liver enzymes for a long period of time? I'm scheduled to see a gastro & Endocrinologist in Oct. but am afraid if something serious; it could be to late.	2012	2012	47	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi all; My mom is 83 years old and has elevated glucose levels for about 5 years now. They rarely went over 150 and she has been able to control her glucose quite well through diet and exercise. But 2 months ago; she went into the hospital for 2 days for an unrelated issue & they fed her lots of high glycemic foods. Her doctor in the hospital said he was concerned she may have low blood sugar so my brothers fed her junk food and cake. When she got home; her glucose reading was 240 and that freaked her out. She returned to a good diet and her number dropped below 180. She went to her doctor for a routine visit and was very worried about her numbers so the doctor gave her xanax and glucophage. I got her to wait on both RX's and her numbers got down into the 130's - 140's with occasional 160's. She is good on her diet but slips a bit. She also walks over a mile 4 - 5 days a week. I just got her last lab results and her A1c was 6.5 & glucose was 128. I have a few questions: 1. Her glucose levels are always lower at the doc / hospital than home - could her testing equipment be bad? I changed the batteries a few times but doesn't seem to matter. 2. We prefer to keep her off glucophage as long as possible due to the possible side effects and not wanting another drug in her system at 83. What are people's thoughts on the benefit/need for meds at her current a1c level? 3. Her doctor shares very little info and when I went with her; he was angry when I asked questions. I found a better doctor but she is resistant to change although she doesn't like him - any ideas on how to persuade her? 4. How do I help her stay stricter on her diet - her weakness is white bread & noodles. I stocked her house with kamut pasta but when she makes food for my brothers; she uses white crap and then eats it herself. 5. My brothers think she should be left alone and I am too involved with helping her with her diet and that occasional sweets & white crap is ok - how do I educate them when they want to be in denial? It is hard doing it alone especially when they spend time with her and/or cook for her. BTW; I live in CA and she lives in IL - I fly there once a month for 4 or 5 days and stock her up on healthy foods and she does great when I am there. Work prevents me from more time with her. Thanks; Joey	2009	2010		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had diabetes for 7 years at least now and im pregnant with my second child.. do any if you feel like the doctors make it hard to feel like you have a personal connection with your baby because they are constantly reminding you of all the negatives of having diabetes while pregnant. . I just went to the doc yesterday and I just feel like sad about this baby like im a bad mom or something. Mt first son had 4 holes in his heart at birth and the doc was saying that is likely top happen to this guy too or I could even carry full term and have to delivery a dead baby.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 48 year old female. I have a problem with total boby tingling upon waking; even my head and face; sometimes feeling like I have been breathing too shallow. This has been happening for about one yr. I occassionally have tingling throughtout the day in my legs; arms; and scalp. I spoke to my pcp about this problem and he said ""That doesn't make since"" and changed the subject. When sleeping I periodically wake with an arm; leg; or my side tingling. I also have periodic intense (so much as to wonder if something is broken) pain in different locations such as my shoulder; knee; neck; and back. It hurts for a day or two then goes away. I ask my pcp about ""Fibromyagia"" as my mother and sis have it but he said ""no"" and changed the subject. My labs at last physical looked normal except for chol. Surgeries I have had are C-section; gallbladder removal; angiogram (for chest pains; results showed left ventrical 37% blocked); carpel tunnel release (right and left). I have taken lisinopril 10mg or other bp meds.for 25 yrs.for high blood pressure; metformin 500mg. for 2 yrs for type 2 diabetes; aspirin 81mg. for 4 yrs.; and currently am not taking a chol med.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi all My partner has Type 2 diabetes; he let his symptoms go for a while without medication but his blood sugar increased. So he went back on the medication about 2 months ago. He is taking Avandia 4mg twice a day; his GP said whilst presribing that 'the jury is still out on Avandia.' and he would review it next month. This made me google the drug and all I am getting is Avandia and lawsuits in relation to heart disease. Yes I would say the jury have retired on this one; what worries me more is that for about the last 3 weeks my partner has had pins and needles in his left arm and some pain. Should he stop these drugs now and look for an alternative; or am I being carried away by the hype. Sorry I haven't looked through the site to see if this has come up before. It is my first time posting to this forum but I am scared for him Jane	2002	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 54 yrs old. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes last Novenber. I am currently taking metformin an 10mg of Byetta 2x daily. In JUne I started to ween myself off of paxil after being onit and prozac for the last 12yrs. I felt that I couldn't loose weight on paxil. I have to say it was hell getting off of paxil. I had brain zaps and every kind of side effect there was. It took more than 2 months to ween myself off. It's been abouat a month now. I did loose about 10lbs.I now feel depressed again and I'm afraid to go back on an anti depressant. I don't want to gain weight again. I am an emotional eater. I weigh 190 and want to loose 40lbs. Is there a way to loose weight and take an anti depressant?	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Wanted to give you overview before asked my question. I've been dieting for the last two years because I gained over 90 pounds during my pregnancy and have only added weight on after it even with dieting (I stuck to weight watchers and then tried LA Weight Loss and nothing worked). I found out in addition to my autoimmune disorder (mixed connective tissue disease which for awhile the docs thought was lupus then fibro); I also have diabetes type II and PCOS which causes insulin resistance which doesn't help the diabetes; the weight gain; or any of it. Doc thinks with diabetic meds; the weight will start to come off now. Am on Metformin; and once the doc can code my medical condition right so my healthplan will cover it; I will also be on Byeta which is another diabetic drug which helps weight loss. She will not prescribe any diet drugs; and has told me to stick to the diabetic diet; and that weight loss will be slow. I'm 220 pounds! I just want to cry so badly. I started Lyrica back in the fall for my joint pain problems and gained weight with that. My joints have not hurt as much; and I won't stop the medicine because I need it to function to chase after my 2 year old. I think the weight gain with the Lyrica has stopped; though. So 220 pounds is what I'm staying at. The diabetic stuff was just discovered quite recently. So; how long does it take to lose weight when you're a diabetic? Is South Beach diet or low carb diet safe if I'm on medication that controls my blood sugar levels? And will walking be enough exercise? I thought about buying that Sweating to the Oldies tape; if it's still sold (I remember from when I was a kid they advertised it on TV with Richard Simmons). I can't afford a gym membership; or an excercise bike or treadmill; especially now since I can barely afford all the medication I'm on (there went my husband's raise this year!) and recover from the money I spent between Weight Watchers and LA Weight Loss which did nothing because of my medical conditions. I wish I hadn't spent the money then; because now that I have the diabetic meds; and the doc thinks the dieting will work; now I need them. I guess if I hadn't used them; though; I would be heavier than I am now; so guess have to count my blessings where I can; huh? So; will diabetic diet and dancing to the oldies or whatever excercise tapes I can find that are not too damaging to my joints be enough to lose the weight? And what is a safe weight loss goal? 2 pounds a week? That was what Weight Watchers had said. Is more too much? I was 140 pounds before I got pregnant 3 years ago. And now 220. That's 80 pounds heavier! And most of that was put on when I was pregnant. *sigh* Just feel not myself. I hate pictures taken of me nowadays. I feel like I've aged 10 years. Does anyone else feel like that too? And how do you stay motivated when nothing has worked in the past two years?	2007	2008	107	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been having headaches for about 3 years; maybe more; but it never seems to go away. I thought that it was because of my eyes; but I got my eyes checked and a new perscription and it didn't help. When I really get a bad headache I get weak and dizzy and sometimes even faint. I can barely stand up for an hour when I have the bad headaches. I have taken tylenol; and ibprofin; and advil; but nothing seems to work. My headache usually starts in the center of my head and goes to the back sides of my head. I have started having back problems and it seems that lately I haven't been getting any sleep. I take ambien; but that doesn't help me sleep either. I am 20 years old. Is this something that I should be worried about? Thanks for any suggestions.	2009	2009	20	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I was diagnosed December 2014 Gloucose was 203 . I was put on invonkana (300 mg) plus I changed eating habits and lost 42 lbs. By June fasting blood sugar was 108. Dr said I could probably come off the meds soon if I keep doing this well . Just went to dr 2 weeks ago and fasting sugar was 135. He changed my meds to xigduo xr. Is a change like this normal ? I wasn't testing my own sugar but now I am ( dr told me not to test cause i will obsess which I kind of am) he told me as long as sugar is between 100 & 150. I'm doing well . Online I read as long as sugar stays below 189 after eating ; that's good . Not sure what my numbers should be . Fasting sugar is usually 120. I didn't start the new meds cause I'm worried about side effects and am trying to control this with the invikAna and diet and exercise . Maybe I should try the new meds. Has anyone ever used this med? Are my numbers too high ?	2015	2015

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I wonder if anyone can answer a few questions. Me and my partner have been trying to conceive for around 4months now with still no sign of pregnancy - both been stressed out by this! Even though its early days yet I can't help but feel a huge disappointment when my period Arrives. I recently came across a page explaining that the medication Metformin that is prescribed to people with pcos or diabetes can actually help when trying to conceive; firstly is this correct? I am a 20year old diabetic myself and was prescribed with Metformin around about 9years ago; being a stubborn; foolish teenager I stopped taking my medication about 5years ago and tried to ignore my illness. Since then I have tried to restart my medication myself on a few ocassions but it always results in me being bedridden from feeling so unwell. I have recently seen my gp who is now in the process of helping me deal with and help me to control my diabetes. If I am prescribed with Metformin as before would this increase my chances of conceiving? And could this be why I have caught pregnant already? Any advice or answers please.	2012	2012	19	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I thought this was interesting especially because magnesium was I believe often low in those with cirrhosis also. Magnesium is also cheap which I always appreciate. I don't think I have heard any downside to supplementing magnesium by the label instructions but maybe someone else knows something I don't. I have given it to Joe on and off. Maybe we should stay on? Magnesium Needed to Help Correct Insulin Resistance Monday; October 25; 2010 - Byron Richards; CCN Health Newsletter Details Magnesium deficiency is pervasive in America. And so is type 2 diabetes. I recently reported on this in an article titled Magnesium Intake Linked to Diabetes Risk. Several more studies add further emphasis to the importance of magnesium in maintaining proper blood sugar health. The first study evaluated magnesium levels in men and women ages 60 – 90 with the metabolic syndrome. Those with metabolic syndrome had lower magnesium levels than those not having the problem. In particular; magnesium affected blood sugar levels and insulin resistance. Another recent study showed that taking 600 mg of magnesium per day significantly improved blood sugar metabolism as well as triglycerides and cholesterol.	2007	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello; I've been having recurring rashes on my body on various places (from past 3-4 months); mostly on my butt; a patch here and there on my thigh; inside of my thigh; etc. I've been to my general physician and a dermatologist both who diagnosed it as a fungal infection and gave me some meds (latest of which was Griseofulvin 250 mg; thrice daily; course completed about 20 days ago). Every Time it was the same; while I'm taking medications; I have no itch nor any rashes; as soon as those medications stop; within a week; I start to itch and then the rashes appear. The itch is not extreme as in I don't have to itch all the time but it's difficult at times I do have to. I have uploaded all pics to my profile page. Kindly help me on getting a cure for this. I do have newly diagnosed Pre-Diabetes but my blood sugar is very normal; never goes beyond 120.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Just found this forum and wanted to say ""Hi"" and introduce myself. I am a 28 year old male with type 1 diabetes. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago on 9/11/03. What a day to pick huh? My father died from complications of diabetes when he was 27. He was type 1 since childhood. I was only 6 weeks old at the time. Obviously I was quite scared when I learned I had it. I was also a little shocked to learn I had diabetes at my age. I have since learned that age really has nothing to do with type 1. I am happy to say that I am now living quite happily with my condition. I don't even think of myself as even having a disease; I'm just a little different. I am currently taking Humulog with each meal and Lantus at bedtime. My A1c's are averaging about 5.2 and my average blood sugar is about 110!!! I do miss some foods but my diet is pretty flexible. My exercise routine is fun and I really enjoy the people I work out with. I have been training mixed martial arts for about two years now. I have also been competetively competing in sport submission grappling. I am a two time silver medalist in the Southwest Submission Grappling Challenge. I am also an avid disc golfer. It's a lot of fun and great exercise too. How many times can you say you walked 4 miles and had fun doing it? Well; there's a little about me. I'd love to hear from you guys and get to know you. I only know one other person with type 1."	2004	2004		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My new doctor changed my prescriptions from regular Met to Met XR and added 2mg of Glimepiride. My BG's have been above 300 for last few months and nothing seems to get them down. Doc thinks this change should do it. I've only taken it twice now but since taking it I've been dizzy. Quite enough I need to lay down. I know it says this may be a side affect but does it go away? It brought my BG's down as I said from over 300 3 hrs after eating to 180 just now. So it is coming down already. Not sure if I can handle this dizziness though. Hope it goes away. Anyone else have this issue and if so; how long did it go and were you able to do anything to lessen the dizziness? Thanks.	2009	2012	50	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have recieved my results from the bloodwork done due to repeated miscarriages (3 in 1 year). All results came back normal except for my hormone levels which are slightly raised (eg testosterone). Gyno has said that he is diagosing it as pcos. He has told me to take 100mg of asprin per day (I dont have a clotting disease) and has said that next time I get pregnant to go straight there and he will put me on hormones;I asked if progesterone was one of them and he said yes. I thought pcos had problems ovulating and getting pregnant; I dont have problems getting pregnant I have problems maintaining pregnancy after 6 weeks.Does anyone know if there is a posibnliity that by taking hormones this will stop me miscarrying. He sid I only have mild pcos; but I am very confused and scared. Has anyone else had these results; I though you had to go on hormones before you get pregnant not when you find out you are pregnant. Could someone please explain any of this too me. Thankyou so much for your time and advice	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Could this be diabetic neuropathy? Started with feet stinging;went to forearms and hands;then entire face; then to neck; shoulders; torso; ribs. Butt and hips get warm spots. Now I am getting mild symptoms of stinging when pressure applied to parts of my body. I do have controlled DMll with A1c averaging about 7.0 while on meds.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	On 8/13/08 I had to get my Testosterone levels checked to start an acne medication and my Free Testosterone was elevated at 2.13 (normal range 0.10-1.50); but my Testosterone was fine at 54 (normal range 14-76). Due to some concern over these results my physician decided to recheck them on 9/25/08 and again my Free Testosterone was high at 3.14 and my Testosterone was also elevated at 79. During my research about high Testosterone in woman PCOS is something that came up more often than anything else. If you could please help me with any information available I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much!	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	HI ALL SO I am reading some info; seems there are different types of PCOS; which may explain why we are all so darn different!!! So ANYONE with any idea what any of these words means; WHICH AM I? I am trying to work out whether I want to go natural or whether I should do as my Gynea says and stick to BC... I have read with some types this is the worst thing; others - the best... SO SICK of confusing info! (VENT!!!) ... anyway any help on the below would be lovely; my symptoms are... - Normal weight (size 8-10 (max)) 53kgs 165cm tall... (SO normal) - Irregular/no periods - mens' pains all the time/generally dull aches and discomfort (when off pill) - Depression/Anxiety (I get the feeling some people think this is a cop-out)? - Tiredness - Hormones are all normal (except prolactin VERY slightly elivated) meaning all my hormone levels are normal - Policystic Ovaries (none/very irregular ovulation?) I dont like BC pill; and I dont see the point in taking it if a) my hormones are FINE and b) I am not ovulating anyway... so I dont know how I can treat this unless I can work out which type I have? I want to think about children in about a year - so my doc says BC till then; but from what I read it can make it worse in some types (like mine wouldnt be conventional) as all my hormones are fine and I am not overweight or underweight. traditional PCOS -- anovulatory; increased androgens; no insulin resistance endocrine syndrome X -- anovulatory; increased androgens; insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes non-traditional PCOS --anovulatory; normal androgens; obese; insulin resistant or type 2 diabetes non-traditional PCOS -- ovulatory; increased androgens; mild insulin resistance idiopathic hirsutism -- ovulatory; increased androgens; no insulin resistance THANK YOU - hopefully someone can shed some light; I am going to be taking this to my next app to battle it out with them (the fight for natural therapy)... x	2009	2009	22	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; My dad is type 2 and has been having trouble when eating. He will eat very few complex carbs; but when he does; his blood sugar spikes. He exercises almost everyday; but is still not losing any weight. He knows about complex vs simple carbs; but even a very small amount of carbs will send his sugars skyrocketing. The endo and gp doctors just tell him; ""you have type 2; exercise more"". He is not making any progress even with a strict diet and exercise plan. What else could be happening? Should he be checked for a metabolic disorder? I want something to check on so that he can discuss it with his doctors. I hear other type 2s can eat a standard 30-40 carbs per meal and not have a huge spike. He eats 15 carbs and it shoots up to 200. Any thoughts?"	2011	2015		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 46 year old female; currently 70 pounds overweight. I have lost 27 pounds in the past 11 months. I had Gestational Diabetes with my last pregnancy and I have tested my fasting blood sugar once or twice a month for the past 8 years; with the results always between 85 and 99. In November; I noticed I was getting the occasional fasting glucose in the 101 to 103 range. By January; they were all in that range. Three weeks ago I started on the South Beach Diet. Phase 1 restricts carbs to a very low level. I have also started exercising on an elliptical trainer 20 minutes; 4 times per week for the past 2 weeks. I know I am eating enough because my weight loss has been very slow -- between 1 and 1.5 pounds per week. To my surprise; my fasting numbers have INCREASED dramatically. My fasting numbers for the past three weeks have been between 111 and 157! Two hours after a meal I have been running between 95 and 110. I am so frustrated! I have lost the ""magic"" 10% of my body weight (more like 12%) and I am eating nothing but low-glycemic vegetables and low fat protein. Why are my fasting numbers out of control and why are my after meal numbers so great?"	2010	2010		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi all. I'm a 56 year old female and I was diagnosed a few months ago with type II. Not too bad. AC1 of 6.4. Doc says if I lose weight and change lifestyle I can probably be diabetes free. Lost 17 lbs. Last AC1 was still 6.3. Was cheating a lot with candy and sugary stuff. So he put me on Metformin 500mg 2x a day. I have to say that taking that did make me feel a lot better. He did not tell me to monitor my blood sugar; but local supermarket was giving out free meters so I got one (tru2go) and some test strips and have been checking here and there; especially when I feel like I'm having a low blood sugar attack. I have never yet had a high reading when I checked at any time. However; I have been having a lot of low blood sugar attacks and readings. In morning around 60; and today felt like I was having an attack even an hour after eating a bowl of unsweetened oatmeal with a banana in it and a bit of fat free milk. I checked and got a reading of 84. My problem is that I suddenly have no income and cannot be going to the DR. regularly. My estranged hubby is ill and had to stop working his full time job (resigned) and isn't making enough to continue to support us (still have kids at home). This happened suddenly. I have been unemployed for a couple of years (due mostly to kid's medical problems) Even my 19 year old can't find a job as yet. We live in a rural area. I go to a local clinic but can no longer pay. And they only had an internist; no nutritionist; or any other specialist to teach me how to manage this. I am waiting on the local Health Dept. to ok my eligibility there and will have access to specialists there. My general diet is high in carbs as I can't afford to buy enough protein foods to lower the carbs and increase the protein with the food stamps I've just been allotted. So I get hungry a LOT cause high carbs are not filling. I get sugar cravings as a result and then eat candy at night. Yes; I know I shouldn't; but those cravings are really hard to fight; not to mention the lifelong habit of high carb snacking at night. I will continue to work on stopping that. But in the meantime; can you tell me if eating some candy the night before can cause my blood sugar to go down so low that even after getting up the next morning and eating that bowl of unsweetened oatmeal and a banana with a little milk; it could still be as low as 84 1 hour after eating? Just from the candy I ate last night? I ate a handful of M&Ms to quickly bring it up; but am still shaking and light headed 15 minutes later. Thanks for any input.	2011	2011		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I was diagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic 7 years ago at the age of 63. I was pescribes a short acting insulin with meals and and 46 units of a long acting insulin each morning because I could not tolerate metformin. I have been well-controlled with my ""normal"" fasting glucose ranging between 6 and 8 mmol/l (108 and 144 mg/dl). About 9 months ago I woke up one morning with a reading of 4.7 (84.6) and in subsequent days the lower readings continued. Over a period of about 6 weeks I stopped taking the short-acting insulin at meals and since then I have been reducing the long acting--at present I am taking 34 units--but the low morning readings continue. I have to take meds (for another condition) at midnight so I usually take a glucose reading at that time and those readings are also trending low. Eating a carbish snack at that time seems to exacerbate the low; driving it even lower. In the past few days I have noticed that when my glucose is below 6 I have dry mouth; like my mouth is lined with cotton fluff. I tested about an hour ago and I was 5.7 (102.6). Yesterday morning I was 4.7 (84.6) and the dry mouth. I take a diuretic-type blood pressure med due to a tendency to accumulate fluid around my ankles but I have been taking it for a year and a half so I doubt it is related to this. Can hypoglycaemia cause dry; cottony mouth and thirst? Or should I be looking for other causes? My diabetes specialist is baffled and has me titrating the long-acting down; 2 unit reduction at a time; trying to find a number that stabilizes my levels. So far no luck. Any ideas or suggestions?"	2018	2018

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Yikes; this is harder than I thought it would be. I've had diabeties for over 20 yrs; most of the time poorly controlled (don't yell at me - didn't know it until I'd had it by Dr's estimate for over 10 yrs and dmg was done - and to top that off I didn't have insurance when I did find out; so little control / supervision). To make a long story short; I'm having major health issues now. They say the devil is in the details; but honestly I don't want to post it all. The problem I am currently trying to deal with is muscle tremors / spasms. They are cyclic; I get them everywhere. They don' t hurt when they happen; its like a little energy pulse going through my muscles and causing them to jerk or twitch. They are madly unpredictable; though when they are happening they do seem to occur more when I lay down to rest. The problem .... sometimes they happen so frequently and for so long (hours) - it causes my muscles to tighten up then cramp. Now my leg muscles are almost constantly knotted. The muscles around my stomach are starting to do the same thing. The knotted and cramping is VERY painful. Here is my question. Do others with diabetic neuropathy have similar problems? My doctor swears the diabeties is the cause - but I'd never heard of it before. I'm kind of hoping it is something else - something they can help me manage or even stop the tremors (which are cyclic and stop on their own for several days / weeks / months at a time then restart with a vengance. So .. anyone else with diabetic neuroapathy have tremor / spasms? Thanks in advance for reading and any reply!	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a 50 year old female who was diagnosed with very mild Crohn's disease at age 38. Thankfully I have long periods of remission. I also have type 2 diabetes treated with metformin; diet; and exercise. In May of 2004 I started to notice an unusual discharge with my stool. I've noticed a pale yellow cylindrical object about one to one and a half inches long; the girth like that of an average woman's middle finger. The outside is tough and resist pressure; but the inside is bright white and very soft. There's usually more than one of these foreign bodies; and they typically are not imbedded in fecal matter. I notice them most when I have diarrhea. They are present; on average; two or three days each month. Previous to this; my Crohn's has affected the last 20cm of my colon; and is evident by blood clots and some white mucous; and severe cramping very low in my abdomen. My last colonoscopy in 2003 was negative. I had problems last summer with severe pain underneath the sternum; lightheadedness; nausea;and loss of appetite. (Very unusual for me - I'm obese; not much can keep me from food!) A HIDA scan of the gallbladder; barium x-ray of the upper GI and small bowel; and a stress test/cardiac ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. Every three months I have blood drawn to check cholesteral levels (all three); kidney and liver function; as well as A1C levels; as part of my diabetes monitoring. Other than slightly elevated cholesteral and an A1C level of 7.3; everything else is normal. I'm scheduled for a colonoscopy in July 2005. I'm stymied as to what this discharge is; it's cause; and if it could be related to Crohn's disease. As stange as it sounds; I have photographed these objects to take to my doctor this summer. I'm perplexed; curious; and a bit worried. Any help you can give me would be much appreciated. For you time and consideration in this matter I offer my sincere thanks.	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 37 y.o. male; recently diagnosed with Type II diabetes; have high blood pressure; high cholesterol; and a high thyroid. I have been taking Synthroid for a very long while and recently have been placed on Metformin for the diabetes; Benazipril for the high blood pressure. I also take Zyrtec for allergies.

Just an annoying intermittent tingling sensation. It mostly occurs when I am at my desk utilizing my mouse and by no means am I set up ergonomically correct.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Dr. Schiano; Hi there! I'm thankful for this site to get a insight into understanding medical diagnoses. Before I get started; I would like to thank you for all you do and taking the time in reviewing my post. Well; I'll start with telling you a little about my health. I've type 2 diabetes; high cholesterol; high trig. (hereditary on mother's side). I was just diagnosed with Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Due to the diabetes and high cholesterol I was taking metformin 500 mg.'s once a day and lipitor 10 mg.'s once a day for about 6 yrs. now. I've now been taken off the medicine's now due to high liver enzymes. I was diagnosed with a fatty liver in 2008. I feel like I'm falling apart; the unknown is the worse. Anyhow; I just had a ultrasound done on my liver; pancreas; aorta and right kidney due to high liver enzymes. I had a attack about 4 yrs. ago with pain under my left breast that radiated around my left side in my back and shoulder area. Never did find out why. However; since that attack; I've to take beano before eating veggies and gas-x at times; or I've a discomfort. Unfortunately; I never did receive a diagnose as to what happened. Ok; so now; I will list my high liver enzymes: 3/24/12- Alanine Aminotransferase 59 U/L High 0-55 7/5/12-Aspartate Aminotransferase 57 U/L High 5-34 7/5/12-Alanine Aminotransferase 100 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/11/12-Aspartate 60 U/L High 5-34 Aminotransferase Alanine Aminotransferase 114 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 7/19/2012-Aspartate Aminotransferase 56 U/L High 5-34 Alanine Aminotransferase 118 Repeated/Ver U/L High 0-55 Ok; so I'm told it's probably from the generic of lipitor; per the pharmacist the generic has the same ingredients as lipitor. She doesn't agree. Anyhow; I'm thinking the same because I've been off the lipitor since 7/6/12; and my enzymes are still climbing expect -Aspartate Aminotransferase did drop a little still not in normal range. Could the cause of my liver enzymes be because of the Hashi's? if so; is it dangerous to have high liver enzymes for a long period of time? I'm scheduled to see a gastro & Endocrinologist in Oct. but am afraid if something serious; it could be to late. Again; I'm greatly appreciated in all you do	2012	2012	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had hashimoto's thyroiditis for over 10 yrs. Recently my tests have shown that I need more medication as they are at the bottom of the range. I have gained wt. but exercise and eat low carb. diet. I have been monitoring my glucose levels with a home meter which shows a.m fasting in the low 100's. My question is; with my thyroid hormones being too low; would that make my glucose numbers too high. I seem to be in the pre diabetes stage. I will see my Dr. next week. Should I wait and get my thyroid to normal levels before taking Metformin. This discussion is related to sudden onset of type 2 diabetes.	2007	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My blood glucose test 10/4/11 was 289. The doctor then ordered an A1c test; the result was 11.5. After seeing the results of my blood glucose test; and especially in the past week after buying a blood glucose monitor and seeing just how bad my blood sugar was; I'd been eating very lightly to avoid an emergency from very high blood sugar. Consequently I've lost eight pounds I saw my doctor for the first time yesterday since having diabetic symptoms and was diagnosed with diabetes. (Surprise! LOL) She said she wanted to start meds slowly; so put me on 500mg metformin and 100mg Januvia and gave me an 1800 calorie diet. And she told me that if my blood sugar should end up over 400 and I was feeling really bad; to go to the emergency room. The idea was that she would gradually increase my metformin; but wouldn't do that until my next appointment in two weeks. She also chided me for taking so many blood tests; saying to only take them at bedtime and before meals for now. I took my meds after dinner last night as directed; but forgot to take my BS before bedtime as I typically go to bed shortly after eating dinner. But by the time I took my BS at 3:30 AM before my middle-of-the-night ""snack;"" it was down to 297. And my before-breakfast reading at 10:00 AM was 291. These were readings similar or slightly better than I'd been getting shortly before seeing the doctor but I'd now been eating more food; so while that was far from being under control; at least we were heading in the right direction. But then I ate breakfast. The meal plan called for 2 starches; 1 meat; 2 fruit; 1 milk and 1 fat serving. Most of the foods I ate were the same foods as listed as a menu example; though I did substitute an extra meat serving (some ham in my scrambled egg) for a starch serving (example was 1/2 cup cream of wheat). I ended up feeling rather poorly after breakfast; but certainly not so poorly I thought I should go to an emergency room. I did lie down for a few minutes to rest; but I was able to go back to normal activities (even got down on hands and knees to scrub a floor) and by lunch time was feeling pretty normal again. But then I took by BS before lunch about 2:00 PM. 548! That would have been about 3.5 hours since finishing breakfast. There was no way with a BS like that that I dared to eat the prescribed lunch of 2 starches; 2 meats; 1 vegetable; 1 fruit; and 2 fats! I ended up having a marinated bean salad over a mostly green salad which I'd interpret as 1 starch; 1 meat; 1 vegetable and 1.5 fat servings. And I'm skipping the afternoon snack of 1 starch and 1 fruit (for which the example was 6 vanilla wafers and 1 small banana. I'd be in the hospital!) My doctor isn't in on Fridays; so I couldn't call her and ask anything. So what would you do? Follow the diet and resign myself that I'll end up going to the hospital to let them sort it out? Go back to my former low-calorie diet at which I was losing weight until I can get an appointment with an endocrinologist? I have no idea how long that would take. (I'm currently at 120 pounds; what I consider the low end of my ideal weight range.) Follow my gut on diet until I go back and see my doctor in two weeks and ask to be put on insulin? Other? And how bad do I have to feel before it warrants going to emergency? Some people go to emergency at the drop of a hat; but with high blood sugar; what is true emergency? What would be the symptoms - besides just a bad reading. (And incidentally; I haven't yet had my monitor checked for accuracy; though presumably most of them are now pretty good. My doctor said to wait until my next blood test in about a month.)"	2006	2011		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My husband had a quad bypass 12/98 at age 63. He was obese and a heavy smoker. Since then he has quit smoking; but is still 20 lbs overweight. He has type 2 Diabetes. May 24; 2005; he had a heart cath done due to continuing mild chest pain. It showed blocked in one of the ""branches"" off a new artery. Decided to stent next day; but the blockage was GONE. Dr. says maybe ""spasms"". Put on nitropatch for one week; then removed and treating with nitroquick as needed for 2 weeks. BP has been running low; under 102/60 most days. BP meds are lopressr 25 mg and vasotec 2.5; one in a.m. other p.m. Thus feels exhausted most of the time. Other meds: metformin; lexapro; wellbutrin sr; simvistatin. synthroid; low dose aspirin. The pain usually occurs while sitting/reclining; though sometimes on morning walk of less than 1 mile. Your website indicates no cure for this.....(?)and his cardiol. says nothing to prevent it......something patient just has to live with..... ARe there other ways to treat this condition? Does it warrant a second opinion or is it fairly common for male age 70? Thank you for help."	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Last year I was told that I had hypoglycemia because my sugar levels would sink low. I was also told that this was probably what causes me to get waves of lightheadedness. I started keeping oranges and juice around and it seemed to help some. My GLU-RD # (new range 60-99) has been crawling up from 101;103 107 and now 109 My GLycohemoglobin *Hemoglobin A1C # (range 4.0-6.0) was 5.8 and now is 6.0 No biggy right? My 12 fasting Tolerance testing says GLU-FST (60-99 MG/DL range) is 109 GlU-1HR (58-160 MG/DL range) is 231 GLU-2HR (70-125 MG/DL range) is 236 She has on the sheet...Diabetes! I eat very healthy and usually never put sugar in anything. How could I be hypoglycemic and have diabetes too. She asked me about starting pills; but I don't really think I need them unless I drink a massive sugar drink that makes me dizzy and want to puke. LOL Or am I just that ignorant to this? I already take Lopressor; and Diazide/Maxide for high blood pressure and edema; Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism; Lipitor for high hs CRP and cholesterol and low dose aspirin for heart issues. I really hate to add another life long pill to this list. I would greatly appreciate any comments.	2008	2009	41	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	i have been doing a good job keeping my diabetes under control. But my last A1C jumped from 6.1 to 6.6. My doctor has put me on victoza; but after using it for a month i have read about some serious side effect issues. While i have yet to experience any myself; i am wondering if it is worth taking along with my metformin and lantus when i am already under 7.0	2009	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am also having trouble with low blood sugar. My blood sugar goes from 44 to 255. I know normal is 80-120 . At the Diabetes clinic they said if mine dropped from 50-70 to take gluclose tabs; 8; but my body is reacting like a normal one. I take 4 at 44 which is life threatening low. I also notice that lately it's dropping after I eat which I don't understand. This discussion is related to Blood sugar drops after eating.	2009	2009	55	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I don't know what to do anymore; my blood sugar is getting too high; and I'm stressing out about it; the doctors increase my insulin but is not helping; I've been crying and I don't even want to eat anymore so it won't get higher :((((	2013	2014

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a female; 60 years old; with type II diabetes; taking 1000mg of metformin daily and have been exercising regularly for well over two years. My glucose is well under control (I thought); with A1C readings between 5 and 5.5 for the last two years. Recently I had reason to wonder about my glucose levels after exercising. I exercise twice a day; early in the AM before work and after work. I usually do a 45 minute routine on the treadmill or a combination of treadmill; bike or resistance. I have found over the last several weeks that my glucose levels rise after exercise in the AM (I workout before eating); usually as much as 30-40 points (from 103 to 145 for instance). In the afternoon; my glucose levels usually fall between 20 - 25 points. Any ideas about what's going on? I do have an appointment with my doc in a couple of weeks and will talk with him; too; but I thought I'd try you out. Thanks!	2004	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was in Urgent Care two weeks ago with what I thought was a ectopic pregnancy. Turned out to be a Hemmorhagic ovarian cyst. The cyst ruptured 5 days ago. The pain has been getting me down but my OB has assured me it will get better. In the process of this I have been told that I may have one of the following diseases. Polycystic Ovarian Disease or Lutean Phase Defect. To make matters worse; my husband and I are trying for a baby. I guess my body does not allow me to get pregnant or stay pregnant. Im now on Metformin which is a diabetic drug that helps with fetility problems. The side effects are getting me down even more. If this does not help get me pregnant in three months; I will then go on another fertility drug that has a high risk of multiples. Im 24 years old and Im overwhelmed with this hitting me all at once. Im excited and scared. I will also need to take progesterone shots during my pregnancy. My husband and I are blessed with a 4 year old. I guess Im just looking for support from people in simular situations. I had no problems getting pregnant with our Daughter. If anyone has any advice; I would love to hear it. Thank you.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Ok I didn't know what forum to post this question in so I'm trying here because it is a Insulin problem. So Ok my insulin levels are 570 but my fasting glucose is perfectly normal. I've had this problem for quite some time now. When it was first found my levels were 130 thee doctors put me on the Metiformin for 2 years to level it out. When my insulin leveled off they diagnosed me with hypothyroidism apparently I have had it for years but the high insulin levels were masking the high TSH levels. They got that under control and I was fine for years then my insulin levels started rising again they tried to put me on the metiformin again but this time around I had awful side effects. They were so bad they couldn't keep me on the drug. My doctor at the time said if the levels aren't bothering me then I can forgo the meds for the time being. At this time the level was 410. It's been a few more years since then and now my doctor is all paranoid that I have a tumor on my pancreases. I'll admit I'm over weight but I also have hypothyroidism and quit smoking a while back; I rarely consume sugar I don't drink coffee I only put honey or agave in my tea if I have a soda it's diet I don't really drink sugary fruit juices I have my 8 glasses of water a day and I try to follow the Canada food guide to the best of my ability. I do have the odd cupcake or cookie from time to time it's not like a refrain entirely I am human after all but I avoid it as much as I can. I'm booked in to see a specialist but it'll be a few weeks before I get in and I'm getting a little worried 570 is kinda high.	2009	2014	36	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I want to know if my weight is correct for my age and height. (Male; 54; 5ft 5in; 145 pounds; Asian Indian). I'm a marginal diabetic (excellent control with 1/2 tablet of 1 mg metformin at night). I walk 40-60 min every single day (3.5 mph); do 30 min of pranayama and 30 min of yoga asanas on alternate days and 30 min of dumbbell weight training on the other three days. Yet; my weight won't go down. I'm a vegetarian; and am reducing the carb intake a lot; relying mostly on salads and veg smoothies. My dietician says 130 pounds should be my ideal weight; my endocrinologist and cardiologist say that given my age and otherwise what he describes as a healthy condition; 145 is ok. Whom do I believe?	2010	2010		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am not understanding why would the fact that a person is overweight put them at higher risk for diabetes. Lets say we have 2 people A and B. A: 150lbs muscle + 20lbs fat = 170lbs total B: 150lbs muscle + 50lbs fat = 200lbs total Lets say they both eat a meal with the same amount of carbs; the insulin response of the muscle cells is higher than that of the fat cells so they both absorb the same amout of glucose with their 150lbs of muscle each. Now fat cells still help absorbing the glucose even though not as much as muscle. So 'A' absorbs some more glucose with his 20lbs of fat; but 'B' should absorb even more with his 50lbs of fat? So seems like the heavier person would actually absorb more glucose out of their bloodstream? Then why are they at higher risk?	2013	2015		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and along with that comes Insulin Resistance. Lately I have been really thirsty; my feet and fingers go numb; I have weird bruising and am always tired. My fasting glucose was 118. I crave sugar and after I eat sugar I usually get a migraine and my stomach feels like a huge balloon and I feel quite nauseous. I am 22 years old; weigh 197lbs; am 5'6""; I get a good amount of exercise but it is really hard to lose weight with PCOS. I have to go for blood testing for my doctor this week and I am quite concerned that my Insulin Resistance has turned into Type 2 diabetes. I know that none of you are doctors but does it sound like I may have diabetes? Thank you!"	2004	2004		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	A little over 2 moths ago; I had a bad slip and fall during some severe winter weather. When I fell; I had struck the back of my head (left side) with loss of conscieness. I had been very confused; disoriented; feeling of neausea; coordination issues; and barely knew my own name. Since the fall; I have experienced facial spasms; bad headaches; left eye pain; memory problems; dizziness; confusion; and neck pain located at the top of my neck. The original doctor that has seen me took an x-ray of the neck and found an abnormality of the C-1 vertabrae; extending forward unnaturally. This prompted the doctor to have me transported to a local trauma center by ambulance. A CT scan was done with no abnormalites. A MRI was later conducted with results stating that everything was esentailly normal. THe noted issues was reversed lordosis of the C-1/C-2 vertabrae; narrowing of the foramina; and disc degenerative disease of C-6/C-7; C-7/T-1. An EEG was conducted; the result was abnormal awake/asleep for partial seziure disorder of the left side of the brain. The side that struck the icy pavement in the accident. I have had physical therapy for my neck pain that is not helping; but actually in some ways making it worse. I have been put on Pamelor first for the headaches. I had even worse dizziness and raised blood sugar levels to excessive levels. Then put on Depakote and could not tolerate that well either. Now I am on Lamictal and not doing to well with this either. In addition; I have been prescribed Vicoden for the headaches on Lamictal. I have never had or ever diagnosed with epilepsy; and only recently diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic (June 2010). I have been told by my Endocrinologist that I am extremely healthy for a Diabetic. He scatches his head at the blood work; because everything is in the levels of a 20 year old athlete; only exception is blood sugar. Here are my main questions for anyone that can help guide me in a positive direction of healing. Before the fall; the only medication that I took was Metformin for Type II Diabetes and was getting ready to come off of of it. Now I am making my local pharmacy very happy and wealthy. The various medications that keep being prescribed that do not work and having to add more diabetes medications to the mix. In addition; I am a couple steps away from being on insulin only. My goal was to get off of the diabetes medication; not stay on it. If I cannot tolerate antidepressant and antiepileptic medications for headaches and given narcotic pain medication. Does this not mean that maybe this is not the issue? Maybe more attentention should be directed at my neck? Physical therapy makes the neck pain worse and not better. This also makes my head and other symptoms worse. Again does this not warrant more investigation? I feel as though I am being ignored and just told to take a medication that makes me feel worse that I already had. If anyone knows of a better path to take to recovery form this injury. I would greatly appreciate the advice.	2011	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 32 years old and have had sensory neuropathy for the last 2 months over my entire body. It began in my feet and rapidly spread throughout my legs; up through my torso and from my shoulders down; then up into my neck. This occurred over a few days. After several trips to my doctor and eventually an internal medicine doctor; then neurologist; no one could figure out a reason. I have type 2 diabetes and was officially diagnosed 4 months ago; but it is in control. The internal med doctor initially suspected Guillain Barre'; but an EMG ruled that out (it was normal). I've had an MRI of my cervical spine and one of my brain. I've had comprehensive blood tests to rule out anything else. I'm on Metformin (for blood sugar) and Avapro (for hypertension). I recently went on these meds; about 2 months before symptoms began. The numbness seems to be a bit worse lately in my right leg and this scares me. The other neurologist I've seen recently says to take a wait-and-see approach since I have no other symptoms. I'm very worried and would like to know what is going on before the numbness spreads any further. I have two toddlers and need to expend my energy with them; not worrying about my health. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 35 years old- I have 1 child- had a c-sec 2 years ago. During pregnacy developed Gestational Diabetes- still taking meds for hugh blood sugar. Prior to pregnacy had normal menstral cycle. Occasional pain on one side mid cycle. Since giving birth my cycle hasn't been quite as regular- but still fairly consistant. Recently I've gone as long as 40 days between periods. They seem normal; not alot of pain- nothing that 1 motrin can't fix- some clotting but I wouldn't classify as heavy bleeding. My problem is mid way I will have pain on one side. The right side has been worse than the left. The pain can last from a few days to over a week (right side). The pain can be debilitating at times- usually requiring many motrin and even then I am still feeling it. My doctor thinks it's mittersmertz (sorry if I spelled that wrong) When I lay in bed for an extended period of time- such as an 8 hour night of sleep- I have low back pain. I can't determine if that is related though- this is something that is consistant and doesn't vary with my cycle. I have recently started burping a lot-but only at night. I know it sounds crazy that I would worry about something like that- I take Metformin 500 mcg 2 times a day and byetta 10 mcg 2 times a day. Both of these drugs can cause gasto troubles. So- Is this something to really worry about? If this was a cancer type situation would the pain be constant? Incidently- when the pains are very severe- it radiates to the thigh on the side that hurts. Any input would be greatly appreciated. After my c-sec; my doctor didn't seem like there could be any types of issues so I would assume that all was well. I don't how much is looked at during childbirth. When I talked to her about this she didn't seem concerned. I am though- being the mother of a young child- I need to take care of myself. Thanks so much in advance.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	When I was diagnosed with Hep C; the ultrasound I had showed moderate fatty liver. I am not overweight and did not drink a lot of alcohol before dx; so I assume the fatty liver has been caused by the Hep C. I am now SVR.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after a brief stay in the hospital (admitted from the ER with chest pains). I was given several tests; including an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test. Here are some of the results from my records: Ejection Fraction: 39% With Moderate Global LV Wall Hypokinesis Normal Stress Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Dilated LV Negative Serial Cardiac Enzymes No Evidence Of Perfusion Deficits Normal EKG With Normal Sinus Rhythm D-Dimer Less Than 150 Troponin First Set 0.015 Albumin: 3.2 g/dL (Low) Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL (Low) Cholesterol: mg/dL 160 HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low) When I was admitted to the hospital; I was already taking Metformin & Glipizide (type 2 diabetes); and I was also on Tenoretic & Verapamil (hypertension). They switched out the Verapamil for Cozaar. I'm now taking: Metformin: 1000mg Twice Daily Glipizide: 10mg Twice Daily Tenoretic: 50-25mg Once Daily Cozaar: 50mg Once Daily I'm going to see my regular doctor next Friday; and I wanted to know what medications/dosages I should suggest. Tenoretic: Is the Atenolol suitable; or should I request another beta blocker? Likewise; is there a better diuretic than Chlortalidone? I keep reading about Coreg and & Demadex. Are these better options? Cozaar: They initially wanted to put me on Lisinopril; but I was on that previously and I had a terrible; nagging cough the entire time. I've read that ACE Inhibitors are preferable to ARBs; though; when it comes to CHF. Should I try another ACE; or would all of them be likely to cause a cough since the Lisinopril did? Or is the Cozaar good enough? (Some places even suggest taking an ACE along with an ARB...is that a good idea?) Blood Thinners: Should I be taking one? (And is low-dose aspirin safe? There seems to be conflicting thoughts on this for people with CHF.) Supplements: Should I be taking any? What about statins? Vasodilators? Digoxin? I apologize for the long post. I appreciate your time & help.	2012	2012		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had two past miscarriages; an ectopic pregnancy and now am currently going through my third miscarriage. With all of my pregnancies I have miscarried before 8 weeks. My first miscarriage was when I was 8 weeks; the 2nd was when I was 6 weeks and this one is I am only 3 weeks... the ectopic was really early as well. I have been seeing a doctor to help with my fertility issues.... as I do have PCOS and do not ovulate regularly. This last pregnancy I was on clomid to help ovulation and then we did an IUI... which was successful at getting me pregnant... but I just can't seem to keep being pregnant. It is very frustrating. My first pregnancy was my only successful one.. and I have a wonderful 6 year old... but since then I have not been able to maintain a pregnancy.... Is there a way to find out why I seem to be miscarrying so early all the time?? I really want to have another baby... but I don't know how many times I can go though this again... and I am losing hope that it will ever happen...	2010	2010	34	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; I just received some bizarre test results and wondering if someone can help interpret them. I am an expat living in Indonesia where good healthcare is very hard to find; and my thyroid and estrogen both seem to be plummeting. Iron and B12 also very low/deficient. I am a 28yo female. Symptoms: weight gain; inability to affect fat composition with exercise; hair thinning and loss; hair by hair turning white and crinkly; low body temp (~97.4F); hirsutism (since puberty); acne (especially chin/cheeks); lately hot flashes! Sleep quality has been extremely poor for well over a year now. Wake ups once or twice a night; and if I stay awake past midnight I'll be awake for hours (was always a night owl but these patterns particularly started March 2013). Never feel rested. Last year massive sugar cravings but under control with Metformin. Mother has Hashimoto's. Medications: 2;000mg/day Metformin XR since August 2013 (a doc in US looked at me when I was seeking help for many of these symptoms and said ""PCOS"". She only tested TSH at that time; which was 1.040 (0.400-5.500)). Also took roaccutane 10mg/day June/July this year for acne. Test results: APRIL 28; 2014 T3: 1.05 ng/mL (0.8-2.0) T4: 6.31 μg/dL (5.10-14.10) TSH: 1.88 μIU/mL (0.27-4.20) FT3: 4.53 pmol/L (3.10-6.80) FT4: 1.09 ng/dL (0.89-1.76) Anti Thyroglobulin AB: 18 IU/mL (Negative: = 115) Thyroglobulin: 38.30 ng/mL (0-55) Anti TPO: 0.20 (AB Index) (1.1: Positive) --- Still not feeling well! More tests! --- AUGUST 5; 2014 Ferritin: Low 15 ng/mL (15 – 150) Vitamin B-12: Low 123 pg/mL (174 – 878) FT3: Low 3.00 pmol/L (3.10 – 6.80 (Adult)) FT4: 1.13 ng/dL (0.89 – 1.76 (Adult)) Estradiol : Low 18.8 pg/mL - Follicular Phase: 39-189 - Mid-Cycle Peak: 94-508 - Luteal Phase: 48-309 - Post-Menopause: 0-41 - Male: 7.6-42.6 Progesterone: 0.19 ng/mL - Follicular phase: 0.2-1.5 - Ovulation phase: 0.8-3.0 - Luteal phase: 1.7-27 - Post-menopause: 0.1-0.8 (This was 5 days after first day of my period; so follicular phase. At least i'm still menstruating??) I went to the doctor that day because of a throat infection which ended up a mean bug. I think my low body temp (usually 97.4) is making me more susceptible to bugs. Also; thyroid ultrasound that day revealed nothing. Actions taken since last year: tried low carb; then not-so-low carb; low GI; on/off gluten free; routinized sleep schedule; exercise (swimming 40 min 4x/week). I eat healthily; mostly food I cook for myself; veggies/chicken/eggs/fruit. I've changed my whole lifestyle and tried everything and this is only getting worse. Do you have any suggestions for what might be wrong here; and what follow up tests I need? I can request any tests I might need. Already guessing TSH for sure; FSH; then ACTH? cortisol (blood test)? Unfortunately I can't get cortisol saliva test here. Should I test my liver function? Ultrasound of my uterus? Pituitary gland? Would very much appreciate if you have any insight or advice. Thank you so much!"	2014	2014		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in march 2014 and i took care of everything to where when i checked it twice daily it would come out to be between 85-90.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	For about 2 - 2 1/2 years now I've had this brownish skin discoloration under my breasts; inner thighs next to pelvic area; small spot under arm and small spots on the back of my neck. The inner thighs and breasts is where it began. It started as small spots like dime size then filled out into large areas. It stays a light brown color and has a faint smell under my breasts. If I get hot and sweaty; sometimes it will get bright red; burn; itch and tingle. When it does this; I clean it with antibacterial soap and it takes away the burning feeling. If I don't shower all day it will itch a little. Sometimes it will get a scaly look but rarely. It's flush with my skin and never raised or inflammed. I've asked 2 doctors about it but neither one have any idea what has caused it and neither did any bloodwork so I'm in the process of finding another doctor. I've read about many different things online and have found several things close enough to possibly be it. I'm just looking for someone elses opinion and possible same experience. I've had dry skin my entire life but it doesn't seem to relate. I have pics but it won't let me attach them from my iphone. Any info is greatly appreciated.	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Just got diagnosed with Type II today; in addition to my other health issues. I'm insulin resistant (had gestational diabetes and found that out when I was pregnant). Funny thing is that I've been taking Lyrica for my fibromyalgia and find out that it was originally used for diabetic nerve pain. Ha ha ha.... well; at least I guess I don't have to worry about that since I'm on Lyrica already. LOL. So; what diets are good for diabetes? I've been tryign to go as all natural and close to organic as I can afford; and my doctor said South Beach diet really good. So I got the book from my motherinlaw today... and a recipe book. How do you stick to a low carb diet? When I was pregnant; I just kept thinking; only so many more weeks and then I won't have to worry about it. After I delivered; my blood sugar levels were normal and I passed the 3 hour glucose test and my 3 month blood levels several months for a followup visit were fine again. But; 2 years later; now have diabetes; and it's for life; not just for a few months. So; how do you get in the right mindset? How do you give up those carbs? And how do you lose the weight!? And what medicines are good? My doc started me on Metformin and wants me to check with my health insurance to see if they will cover Byeta (not sure of spelling on that). Are those good drugs? Do they help with weight issues? Or do they cause weight gain? My father did not do well on Byeta and he blames that medication for messing up his levels; and he says he had to stop Byeta and go on insulin and he had been fine before doing it. So; is Byeta bad? Or is it good? My father is insulin resistant as well; so I think it's a genetic thing. And what things do you buy to keep in your house!? Looking in my closet; reading all the labels; man do we have a high carb household! I nearly dropped dead when I saw the carb count on the bagel package. And to think I was having one of those suckers every morning for breakfast!	2007	2008	107	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	About 5 years ago I had a fist-sized complex cyst removed from my right ovary. They had originally thought it was dermoid based on the scan; but it turned out to be a haemorragic cyst with some additional blood vessel stuff going on. It's possible that it had grown over many years - I'd had irregular bleeding and pain for about 9 years; but never had it taken seriously enough to have a referral to gyn. This cyst was removed keyhole and they took part of the ovary that was damaged but left the rest. They also did a D&C because my uterus lining was overgrown; probably just as a result of so much irregular bleeding. Things never fully 'settled' and after a while the symptoms returned; though initially not as badly. Scan showed at couple of persistent corpus luteum cysts; so it seemed like the process was beginning again. Keen to stop me ovulating; they fitted a Mirena. Total nightmare - I bled and cramped for 12 weeks then expelled the thing in the ER in excruciating pain and severe shock. Shortly after that one of the cysts ruptured; and I spent a few days in hospital in agony with that; so they operated and found that in addition to the ruptured cyst and the remaining blood-filled corpus luteum cyst I also had multiple PCO style cysts; and my ovary was adhered to my bowel and my abdomen wall. So; they did a major clean up. They had previously said that I couldn't possibly have PCO cysts and functional cysts; so that was a surprise. That was over 3 years ago. Life since then has been way easier. Normal periods with normal period pain; roughly on schedule and without random bleeding in between! Then about 4 months ago I started to get a bit of spotting between ovulation and my period. My periods have been getting longer and more painful; and I've had many more hormonal symptoms - breast pain and a linea negra. Now I have - for approx 4 weeks - on-off pain in my right lower abdomen. The pain seems to originate about half way across that side; just an inch or so above my groin. Hurts to touch; pain is worse with activity; and radiates right down into the groin / thigh and into my pelvis on that side. Occasionally I'm having more period-y type cramping as well. The pain in my side is occasionally really sharp; but often feels like a weird burning sensation; almost like an itch. I've been referred for a ultrasound and gyn follow up - I've moved house since my last problems so there's no fast track. I will likely wait 12 weeks for the appointment; if I'm lucky. I can live with this at the moment; but I can't stand the thought of it getting as bad as it was before. I won't know until I see the gyn whether they are the 'wait and see' type. I kind of want to know how to approach the doctor at the first visit. I saw half a dozen different gyns through my previous treatment - it was a teaching hospital - and they all had totally different opinions. The final one who operated on me was female and said she had no idea how I had been functioning (I barely was by the end) and that I should have been fast-tracked into surgery much sooner. I've learned that the decisions made about your treatment are often a bit arbitrary; and taking a position yourself is not a bad idea. I've done waiting and seeing before; and it hasn't worked out! Does anyone have experience of recurring cysts which have become less problematic? Have you done 'wait and see' and had it resolve untreated? I don't relish the idea of another surgery; but if it's going to be needed I'd rather not go through several months of escalating pain first.	2010	2010		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Because I was very unsatisfied with the Dr. I saw 2 weeks ago who did 2 hypo tests (TSH and T4); said I was withing ""normal range"" and get me some Metformin to help with weight loss (haven't lost anything yet btw); I went to see another Dr. a friend referred me to on Tuesday. He was so much more detailed with me! I brought a list of symptoms with me just to ensure I wouldn't forget anything! He not only told me that I do have alot of the symptoms for Hypo but also Growth Hormone Deficiency (I'm not a very tall person; about 5'4"")! That other doctor never even mentioned it (and I think she just gave me the drug for the weight loss and perhaps she thought that was my ONLY reason for seeing her. It wasn't at all. She never even touched on the other symptoms; just the weight gain). Anyways; this is what he tested on Tuesday: Hemoglobin A1C Somalomedin T-3 Free T-4 Free TSH Thyroid Peroxidase Antibiodies This will help with results for ""regular"" tyroid problems; also Hasimoto's and GHDeficiency Today I spent 2 1/2 hours here having a ACTH Stimulation Test. That was fun. Ugh. Blood drawn for a baseline; an injection into my hand and 3 other draws every half hour. I also have to do a 5 hr Glucose test in July as well. I should have the first results back tomorrow. Today's next week. He was VERY attentive and listened to me and acknowledges that something is in fact wrong with me and he WILL one by one determine what it is not! My arms and hand look like I'm a drug addict at the moment and hurt like hell; but I know in the end; it will all be worth it!"	2012	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I am a 29 year old female ; 300 lbs; high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. It took a lot for me just to actually openly say that in a forum like this. but here goes I have been on a path towards better health; I went pretty much my whole life never taking my health into consideration and now that I have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure reality has set in and made me realize that I am not longer able to be in denial that I have a problem. I knew that I wasnt headed in the right direction all these years; but I had little to no self control. Food just always seemed more understanding then anything; and I cant believe how out of control I allowed myself to get. But I am a mother of an 8 year old and its time I start setting a better example for her. So I am currently trying to gain more education about nutrition and these two awful diseases i have at such a young age. I thought I would mention that before I go on about my question. So back in October I had started taking metformin twice a day 500 mg ... but i wasnt very consistent with it; i barely took it because of the side effects as far as going to the bathroom like crazy. and I was also put on 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for my bp; to see if a water pill could help reduce it before I had started an actual medication. but again with that i wasnt consistent because I always felt really awful cramps in my legs i was also put on an oral contraceptive called alesse because i was also diagnosed with a cyst on my right ovary; so my ob wanted to see if the pill would help shrink it(this med i was taking as prescribed) but in december i started taking my water pill and metformin medication religiously as prescribed and i later had to receive iron infusions because i started to get severly anemic; and in january my potassium levels were very low; causing my fingers and toes to always cramp and stick together; it was weird; I also started to feel extreme faint feelings i was driving and nearly fainted behind the wheel and had to go to emergency where the dr just said that i had vertigo and needed to follow up with my doctor. i wasnt convinced it was vertigo because i had it before when i was 25 and the room did not feel like it was spinning i felt like i was going to collapse at any moment. in january i was put on potassium pills; and given a bp medication amlodipine. which helped lower my bp from the 180/90 range to the 149/90 range. and the ob discontinued the birth controls saying it was contributing to my high bp. and one night while driving in january i nearly fainted behind the wheel again this time with my daughter in the car! i go to emergency and they kept me over night to monitor my heart they did some contrast test to see if i was having a pulmonary embolism because i felt pressure in my chest as well. I also went for a ct scan and chest xray along with a 24 hour blood pressure/heart eko. and they also did a stress test where they injected me with something that would make my heart race and all tests came back normal; potassium levels were back up. my doctor just took me off water pill amlodopine and metformin. i am now just taking lisinopril and .25 mg of xanax as needed because i am not sure if those feelings are anxiety related or something else. the other day at work from the moment i woke up i felt dizzy; off balance and weak; i went to work my eyes started to blur and i felt the fainting feeling coming on again was brought to emergency all blood tests were normal; i dont know what to do anymore its interfering with driving; work; and im afraid. my doctor is ordering a vitamin d test for monday and some more fasting labs. when i got to the er my sugar levels were normal my blood pressure was elevated to 156/90 but later back down to 130/70 laying down and sitting up and 127/70 standing. oxygen levels clear... my question is what else could i suggest looking into? i am always staying hydrated	2015	2015	29	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I was diagnosed with diabetes in late May of this year. I am slim build and 34 years old and I was originally thought to be type 1 however my GAD results were negative and as I only require about 6 units of slow acting insulin (insulartard) a day my health care team now think I am type 2. My problem is with extreme tiredness. Since a few days after diagnosis I have been suffering with extreme tiredness which has been getting worse and now I can't even work. I was tired in the months (and years) before diagnosis however this feels very different. It is like my gas tank is empty and I feel wiped out often after only a few chores or similar. My blood glucose levels are relatively stable and within limits. My doctor has run tests for thyroid and anemia plus others and they have come back as negative. She now says that there are no other tests she can run. My diabetes team say they can't help as my blood glucose levels are normal. At diagnosis my A1C was 12.8% and although my diet had been moderately healthy it was very carb heavy; possibly about 70% of more of my diet.. Now my carb intake is much lower at about 30%. Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing my tiredness? I would be very grateful for any suggestions I could investigate. best wishes Rich	2009	2009		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Good Morning; all...I went to the dr. on Tuesday so he could give me the results of my blood work and u/s I had done last week. He said by looking at my b.w.; he does not think I've ovulated (last AF was 8/11) and my u/s showed no signs of cysts & everything looks to be normal. But he thinks I may have cysts inside of my ovaries; which could be the cause of the pain I've been experiencing on my left side. So his conclusion is that I either have PCOS or endometriosis. For now he is calling it PCOS because in order for him to diagnose me w/ endo.; he would have to do surgery. The next step for us to take is when I start my period; he is going to put me on clomid to hopefully make me ""o"". My cycles were lasting 48 days; but today is cd 49 and still no sign of AF. He didn't give me any info. on PCOS; or any meds so I was wondering for those of you who have PCOS; does this sound like that's what it is; and what experiences have you had w/ it? Thanks!!!!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I am a 23 yrs of age and have recently become aware of an ovarian cyst. I developed a 1 in. lump in the right lower pelvic reg. in March. Since than I have had 2 ultra sound exams that were approx. 3-4 monthes apart both showing the size to be 1 in. and unchanged. I have been put on 2 months of birth control to shrink the size but am experiencing side effects from the pill and still have discomfort in the R lower pelvic reg. My GYN advised to finish the prescription. Mean while she has not told me too many details about the results from either of the ultra sounds or what all my options are. She doesn't seem to believe the pain and discomfort is coming from the cyst but doesn't offer any other possible causes. I know my own body and I can feel a sm. mass in the R lower reg. upon palpating. This is the same place the pain is located. I need some answers and don't know what else to do. Please help me. Thanks.	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 60 yr. old female with a family history of heart disease. I am 25 lbs. overweight and have type 2 diabetes. I take metformin; janumet; caduet and until yesterday diovan. During a stress test yesterday my systolic bp rose to 260 in a very short time (diastolic was elevated but not so greatly). When my BP has been taken several times throughout the year at rest it has been 120/80 (ish). I am not very active but do walk 1-1/2 miles a day at a moderate rate. The cardiologist took me off of diovan and told me to begin 100 mg toprolol (sp?) immediately. He said it is important to continue to get exercise. I am fearful since I walk much faster and longer than I did on the stress test. I have a follow-up app't. in one month. The ultasound of my carotids and heart was fine. He mentioned abnormalities in the ekg related to my left ventricle. I assume if it was extremely serious I would have been hospitalized. Any info would be appreciated. I suppose I shoud have asked but at the time I was shocked. This discussion is related to extreme high blood pressure.	2010	2010	58	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	J Hepatol. 2009 Apr;50(4):712-718. Insulin resistance predicts response to peginterferon-alpha/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients. Dai CY; Huang JF; Hsieh MY; Hou NJ; Lin ZY; Chen SC; Hsieh MY; Wang LY; Chang WY; Chuang WL; Yu ML. Hepatobiliary Division; Department of Internal Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital; No. 100; Tzyou 1st Rd; Kaohsiung 807; Taiwan; Faculty of Internal Medicine; College of Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung; Taiwan; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine; Kaohsiung Medical University; Kaohsiung; Taiwan. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Insulin resistance (IR) might be associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to elucidate impact of IR and beta-cell function on the response to peginterferon-alpha (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty patients without overt diabetes were treated with combination therapy with (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin for 24 weeks. The IR and beta-cell function were evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) before treatment. RESULTS: HCV genotype; pretreatment HCV RNA level and pretreatment HOMA-IR; but not HOMA-beta; were independent factors associated with sustained virologic response (SVR). In 150 patients with genotype 1b infection; pretreatment HCV RNA level; HOMA-IR and age were independent predictors for SVR. The significantly lower SVR rate in high HOMA-IR patients was observed in 76 patients with high HCV RNA levels (400;000IU/mL) who were defined as 'difficult-to-treat' patients. The mean HOMA-IR of 'difficult-to-treat' patients was significantly lower in 42 sustained responders than in 34 non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: IR was associated with SVR to (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin therapy for CHC; especially among 'difficult-to-treat' patients. These findings suggested clinical application of pretreatment HOMA-IR could enable treatment outcome to be predicted and treatment regimens to be determined.	2007	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have Type 2 Diabetes and was put on Victoza yesterday; my doctor wants me to take this for weight loss. I would just like to know if anyone has lost weight or has had any side effects while taking this medication. I was on Byetta but the nausea never stopped and I felt bad all of the time. I took my first dose this morning of Victoza and so far there has been no nausea--I just hope it lasts. Any comments on this medication would greatly be appreciated. Also---my doctor has put me on lisinopril even though I don't have high blood pressure; he said this is a ACE inhibitor and will protect my kidneys. I have read BAD reviews on this medicine and I'm not sure what to do. I told my doctor yesterday that I was leery about taking this; but he seems to think this is a good medication to take.	2010	2010	45	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"According to the 65 clinical studies; PPC improved subjective symptoms and clinical findings such as pain in the right hypochondrium and hepatomegaly; biochemical markers of hepatic cytolysis; detoxification; excretion; synthesis; clearance and dyslipidemia; imaging data by ultrasonography or computed tomography; and histological evaluation of steatosis; necroinflammation and fibrosis. One study included a quality of life assessment by focusing on pain syndrome and dyspeptic symtoms. The first significant effects were observed after 4 weeks; with further improvements over the following months (up to 24 months). PPC was more active than diammonium glycyrrhicinate; ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); bezafibrate; and fish oil. A combination therapy of metformin; diet; exercise and PPC in patients with type 2 diabetes was more effective than metformin; diet and exercise alone. The same was the case for the combination therapy of PPC with UDCA. No relevant side-effects were reported. ""Based on the pharmacological and clinical data; PPC would appear to be the drug of choice for significantly reducing or abolishing fatty liver of different origin; e.g. due to alcohol or obesity; even if the causing noxa cannot be eliminated; as is the case with diabetes-associated steatosis."""	2017	2017	26	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband is 53 and was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in April of 2008. Prior to that time; he was in good health with the exception of a bad bout of Mononucleosis in 2001. Terry my husband has been a “shiftworker” for 35 years. As a result his lifestyle habits (in my opinion only) are not the best. His eating habits unless he is on night shift quite often include perhaps a light and late breakfast of toast and coffee and perhaps nothing all day or something light in early afternoon and a big supper usually late 7:30 or 8’ish. Some salads; some fruit but not a whole lot of either. He is mostly a meat and potatoes man. Although physically active around the home; he is not involved in any sports and; his employment is not in the normal course a physical one as he does some walking; etc. doing his checks but the majority of the time he sits monitoring panels. His sleep patterns over the years have become increasingly worse and it is not uncommon for him to be falling asleep in front of the television at 8 or 9 and then waking up at 3 or 4 and being unable to go to sleep again. When he sleeps after night shift it is usually only 4 to 5 hours and in the past two years; it is not uncommon for him to have a couple of hours or no sleep at all on his last night shift. As you can see; combined with his recent diagnosis of diabetes; he is not doing as well as he could although his sugar levels are surprising usually pretty good ranging between 5.5 and about 9.5. He is on Metformin 500 mg. (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening); Lyrica 75 mg. (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening) ; Avalide 75 mg. (1/2 a pill in the morning); Synthroid .1 mg. and Crestor (unknown); one of each in the morning. If his pre-supper reading is high; he takes a Gluconorm. We understand from the doctor that he may have been diabetic for between 3 to 5 years without diagnosis. Terry started out with some pain in his right leg that wouldn’t go away (Feb. 2008) and finally went to a walk in clinic in April of 2008. Hence his diagnosis. Since that time and the host of medication that he has been on; his heath has declined rather than gotten better. During June and July of 2008; he had extreme pain in his feet. Symptoms included burning. Stabbing pain; numbness that went up his legs and buttocks but ongoing extreme pain in his feet and an intolerance to anything enclosing his feet (shoes in particular) and therefore has been wearing sandals when at all possible. As we live in central; mid Canada; the winters go down to 40 degrees celcius at times and his life in many respects has become unbearable. During Mid May to July; he had been to an neurologist; had nerve conduction tests which he passed with flying colours; was subscribed a couple of additional meds (one of which was Prednisone) at different times to add to the Lyrica in hopes of getting his pain under control and hopefully find some type of answer as to why all this was happening. Cymbalta worked well in the beginning when combined with the Lyrica (and I think he was being weaned off the Prednisone) and reduced his pain so that it was manageable and for a brief period of time (most of the month of August); he was for the most part back to being the man he used to be. We paid for an MRI in August on his head. It showed nothing except a few muddy areas that his GP and Neurologist indicated were fairly normal for a man his age and that basically; it was “inconclusive”. In the fall; Terry’s pain became a little worse again and in his frustration; he went off the Cymbalta on his own. During that 3 week period which was scary for me has he wouldn’t go to the doctor about it he had little “blackouts” of several seconds but could still function through if that makes any sense in addition to the flu like symptoms normally associated with going off that type of medication. Essentially he tells me that that hasn’t made any difference. He has pain in the ball of his right foot which after much internet reading and desperation on my part; I thought perhaps he might have Morton’s Neuroma. Again; we waited for an MRI which scanned his feet and legs up to his hips. Again it showed nothing. The pain is increasing but we believe he is starting to be able to live with it rather than the fact that the pain has decreased. The pain now increases when he sits. The longer he sits the worse it gets. Numbness; burning…..pain in his feet that increases in intensity. Numbness; and burning spread up his legs into his buttocks and when he’s having a bad day it spreads to his arms; hands and the one side of his face. He has some “good” days which qualify as minimal pain and the ability to function well without trying to hide it all the time. Sometimes the good days last for 2 or 3 consecutive days but we don’t have these often. He’s also had a rash twice on the insides of his thighs but it seems to go away on its own. He also seems to get bouts of diahhria more often and for no reason but this too goes away after a couple of days. Also bouts of what we call flu which comes with it; the aching and swollen glands and sinus symptoms. Terry has always had off and on back pain and so we finally have a third MRI booked for June 1st to do his back. In the meantime; his quality of life has definitely taken a big hit; he is depressed and unhappy with the world and at times; his mood swings are horrendous to see and have to bear the brunt of. I have been watching his feet really carefully as neuropathy was the first thing that came to mind however; his feet are always a good colour and when he hurts them; they seem to heal in a normal time frame and in a normal manner. I have been reading on the internet a lot…trying to find anything that might give us a clue and thus far the only thing I can come up on Google Advanced Search is Chronic Lyme Disease. Actually this could be a possible as he an outdoors type of guy and we do a lot of camping in the summer and prefer out of the way places. Is there anything in my “rambling” above that might give you any other avenues to try?	2008	2009	53	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	It seems that even after a couple years of being on Armour; my T4 free has never went up; only has stayed the same and recently went down. I had my levels checked on 6/7/11 and they were as follows: TSH 1.32 (.55-4.78); FT3 2.9 (2.3-4.2); FT4 .09 (.89-1.76). Even though my numbers don't show hyper at all; my symptoms say otherwise at 60 mcg; which is what I was on when tested (just made another post on this; different question though). What can I do to get my FT4 up; or do I really even need to since it's the T3 that is the active hormone? Would this be more of an issue if I were on a T4 only med? Do you think it is even affecting the way I feel that much?	2011	2011	44	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have been messed up since I got my first period at 11. They never seem to end and when they do it only stays gone a day or two. Especially if I have sex. Birth control pills helped for a while but never really answered the question ""what's wrong w/ me?"" So last October I wanted to get pregnant so I quit taking BC pills and started suffering. The doctors just always act like it is no big deal. I would like to know that I am not the only one who has to wear a pad every day. I would like to know why my body does this. I would like to know some way to fix it. I am a little overweight; I have recently been having painful pimples on my body and face; I do have some face hair. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I used to have a lot of pain; but I do not anymore. I am 25 years old"	2005	2005

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'll thank everyone in advance for any help/advice. I am a 57 year old female very healthy and fit; but because of family history very worried about becoming diabetic. I also have thyroid disease. In 2007 I lost 40 lbs after my fasting blood sugar spiked for the first time. Since then my fasting blood sugar has been in the normal range and my A1c has been between 5.5-5.7 when tested. This past 90 days I had the best diet I could possibly manage and regular exercise; however not quite as much as usual. I am a mountain bike rider; tennis player and hiker; very intense exercise. So much to my surprise my latest A1c came back 5.8. I was expecting it to be much lower. I am at real loss; the endocrinologist I was seeing left our town and the closest is 2 hours away. I did see a new doctor; but I am not scheduled to see her again until May. My previous Dr. had briefly talked about me going on metformin. I guess my question is; should I be more proactive? Or do I just wait until I hit the 6.0 and get the diagnosis before I get treatment? I just don't know what to think? Help!!! Peggy	2009	2009	56	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been without smell/taste for almost one year. ENT examined via scope and MRI - nothing further. Opinion is that there was damage to the olfactory nerve from several bouts of sinusitis. Damage probably permanent (?) Over the past 3-4 months; I've been experiencing what I believe may be phantosmia. When I am around food there seems to be a foul odor much like a dirty cat box or spoiling meat. No one else smells it; it's very frustrating and disconcerting. This same sensation happens throughout the day; but tends to fade in and out. Is this some kind of phantom sensation; or is it possible that my olfactory nerve(s) could be regenerating? Medications being taken: Metformin; synthroid; effexor;singulair; lisinopril; zocor Medical conditions: Type 2 Diabetes; hypothyroid; depression; allergies; Hi BP; Hi Chol	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have over the past few days been feeling `numbness and tingaling' in my lower right arm (the whole arm). I am on Metiformane Tablets 3 x day but found my reading was 15.3 yesterday so have increased tablets to 5 a day. Any suggestions on what else I can do for this. I do not have easy acess to Doctor or medicines at present. The urine I am passing is very dark yellow in colour it does not smell. I also do not feel 100% at any stage of the day or night and am taking Brufane Tablets for my back pain (as below). I also have a continious back pain which has been with me for the past 5 months. Seen a Ciro in Harare who basically said back is messed ( hit too many Landmines 20 years ago in a war :) )and have been taking Brufane Tablets about 6 a day which help with pain but not always so good. Also not sure if one should be taking this type of tablet for long time? Is there any other tablet that I can take that will effectively relieve the pain but not be harmful in the long run. The pain is not very sore but enough to get ones attention and effect sleep at night. Any suggestion would be nuch apperciated.	2008	2008	49	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi there; I gave up smoking around one year ago and since then and only now and then in the morning I wake with a really dry throat and a huge lump of phlegm in it. When I clear my throught the phlegm is dark green/brown and has what looks like fresh blood in it and I often wake up and and night have a taste of blood in my mouth....this must happen about once or twice a week. I've been to a doctor and they have sent me to a specialist and have asked for a chest x-ray...I had one about 9 months ago and it was clear... Should I be worried as I am to be honest? I don't suffer from anything else just that it feels like I have a lump in my throut sometimes......and the above mentioined. Also my voice is often hoarse and croky in the morning....as if i am still smoking.....and I am 27 years old. The only pain I get is sharp shooting from the left side of my chest and across my upper back where my shoulder blades are..... Kind Regards David This discussion is related to Symptoms of quitting smoking.	2009	2009	26	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I had some issues with microalbumin. That has since been resolved with my blood sugar now under control but my doctor said there was probably some level of kidney damage that I have to monitor. A recent blood test showed a BUN of 12 and a Creatinine of .6 with the GFR >60. All other metabolic tests were within the ranges. I thought those numbers were adequate but he mentioned some concern about the ratio between BUN/Cre and the low level of creatinine. I thought low blood creatinine was a good thing. I'm 42 yo and weigh 145. I try to watch what I eat and exercise and am on BP meds and Metformin. Any insight into these test results is appreciated. Thank you for your time.	2010	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My father had a heart attack in the past; he did an open heart surgery to replace an artery in his heart. today his heart ejection fraction is at 43%. Doctors prescribed for him 8 different medicines that he should take regularly. We live in Lebanon; and medicine here is not as advanced as abroad; and doctors here are known to trade with people's lives; I'm no doctor and I'm not qualified to ***** any of these prescriptions; but i would appreciate an insight of an expert and/or a person who came across these drugs. I want to know if there are dangerous risks of taking this combination of drugs; and any other comment on the issue would be greatly appreciated. the drugs are: GLUCOPHAGE 750mg Pariet 20mg Isoptine 240mg VASTAREL 35mg Plavix 75mg Lipitor 20mg Aprovel 150mg LORAZEPAM 2mg Thank you very much.	2011	2011	22	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi! I had some bloodwork last week & got my results today . My A1c was 6.3 (which is down from my original 7.8) and my glucose level was 109 mg/dl. When I look at a1c charts ; it seems 6.3 coincides with a glucose level of 134. How can the bloodwork Glucose level from the bloodwork be 109? Shouldn't it be 134? Idk what is right. I started out meds in December 2014 but after finding this sight and getting info from here; I changed my diet to low carb and got off the meds ; so thanks so much for that help! But now I am confused about these test results	2015	2016		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 64 years old male and I have had COPD for several years; I recently quit smoking after serious pneumonia in 2016. Right after that; I have had persistent constipation and have been taking daily laxatives for the past 1.5 years and have been able to get motions with that except for the past few days I have developed a new problem where I am usually belching like crazy while eating and I ultimately have to stop eating just after a few bites because nothing goes down and it feels like the food is sitting idle where my food pipe meets my stomach and a burp is stuck there with is a huge urge to burp it out but I am unable to do so thats why I keep on belching to get rid of it to no avail. Sometimes the belching goes too bad that I vomit the food out. With this new problem another problem has arisen; I am getting almost no motions from laxatives at all now; all I get is a small amount of loose motions every alternate day or so; and sometimes just a few drop like consecutive installments of small amounts of loose stools. It always feels like stool is stuck down there and I strain to get it out but I can't. Since I have breathing trouble I haven't been able to consider the doctors request to get an endoscopy; but I just wanted to ask that are we supposed to take laxatives daily; since doctors in my place thought that it could be done? I have been taking one that is a mixture of sodium picosulphate and paraffin with milk of mangensia which is a strong laxative I suppose. One gastro told me that it may be the inflammation of the intestines that is hindering the motility of food. Also the color of my stool has become clay colored or pale colored but the other two mentioned a different story; Liver profile was normal; cbc was normal; ultrasound was normal; but I haven't had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy so far due to my breathlessness. Do you have any knowledge about these symptoms or any experience with such disease?	2017	2017	64	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I am new here and i hope i am not breaking any rules but my question ia about what effects smoking pot (marijuana) will have on my son (20yrs old) who is diabetic. I am not 100% sure that he is doing this but am sure he has tried it at least once and i want to be able to give him all the correct information about the dangers he is putting himself in before i speak with him about this. Of course there is the effects which will happen whether he had diabeties or not but i would be grateful for any advice which anyone may have on this subject.	2004	2004		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	For six years; I believed there was a single-source connection between interferon resistance and interferon resistance. It is; as I suspected; a gene. The gene is SOCS3 - Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling-3. The discovery of this gene also sheds some light on why prior nonresponders have more trouble acheiving SVR. 1. SOCS-3 is elevated by HCV's core protein. 2. SOCS-3 elevation causes interferon resistance. 3. SOCS-3 elevation causes insulin resistance in the liver. 4. SOCS-3 depletion reduces liver insulin resistance; but causes systemic insulin resistance. 5. SOCS-3 is further elevated in people who have treated unsuccessfully. These findings suggest a new and viable target for therapy.	2003	2008	54	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	on 05/13/02 i had my blood taken for my life insurance policy my AST level was 18 and my ALT level was 28.

The ALT 43 has the word ABNORMAL next to it and he tells me in the letter i need to schedule an appointment.I am very worried about level's rising in a year's time.IS it something to be concern about?Knowing from the paper work it has something to do with my liver.I am 36 year's old;i was on ACIPHEX for 1 year but stopped taking it 1 month ago.I do not suffer from any pain and my appetite is very well; i have problem's with irregular bowl movement.I am very worried about this situation. thank you	2003	2003		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am T2 diabetic; not well controlled; on glipizide 3xday; with numbers averaging 220. I suffer from Severe Depressive episodes and am in therapy and on medications for that. I have almost constant nausea; and BMs about 6x a day. I also have vaginal bleeding; which we think is from uterine polyps (biopsy scheduled). However; the most debilitating physical symptoms I have at present are the almost constant nausea; troubling BM's with a sickening odor and FATIGUE. It's difficult to tell which is causing which; but is there a reason that the diabetes would cause the nausea and BM problems? I currently have no insurance; thus no recent blood tests; but am hoping to get hooked up with a clinic after the biopsy.	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10 months ago.My doctor's instructions-Metformin twice a day;strict diet and exercise for weight loss;& use the internet to gain as much information on the disease as possible.I lost 45 lbs;A1c is now 6.3;& blood sugar and pressure levels are well within commonly acknowleged safe ranges.I am frankly angry and frustrated over the blatent lack of consensus and contradictory info on safe diabetic nutrition from these sources;all authored (it seems)by self-proclaimed 'expert' dieticians and ADA card carrying MD's.In particular-The info is directed at insulin dependent diabetics;rather than those;such as myself; who need to know specifically what differences(if any) in food intake we need to follow in order to avoid going on insulin.As a low income person without health insurance;the prospect of simply having to become a human pin cushion is unpleasant enough.But having to pay $4000 to $5000 a year out-of-pocket for insulin;testing strips;syringes;constant blood tests etc would leave me homeless--effectively;a death sentence.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; I hope someone can help me with understanding the results of a cardiac CT scan. First a little history; I am a 51 yr old female; I had to have a hysterectomy at the age of 42 due to multiple complicated cycts of the ovaries; I have hypothyroidism; type 2 diabetes; COPD emphezema and am considered medically obese. Two years ago I had an echo but the results were noted as inclusive as it stated they were unable to obtain a clear image. My Dr. ordered the cardiac CT to ensure that my breathing issues were not impacting my heart. It's not one event that puzzles me but the culmination of multipe events. I was average weight 110-115 (I'm 5 feet tall) up until 6 years ago when I started to rapidly gain weight - I went from 112 to 172 in 1 1/2 years. Despite multiple pleas from me my Dr. had only run thyroid tests after all the weight gain only to find out my thyroid level was 89! Last Tuesday I had sudden and severe sharp chest pain; I couldn't take a deep breath. Because I had known the results of my CT scan I didn't think it was a heart attack so I didn't go to the ER. The first episode lasted about 20 mins and a second one later that night about 40 mins. I was thinking possibly gall bladder so I went to my Dr on Thursday. She ordered a sonogram which showed: normal pancreas; gall bladder; spleen; mildly complicated cyst on my right kidney measuring 3.5 cm and a complicated cyst with calcification at one edge and a single septation on my left kidney measuring 1 cm. Calcifications were noed in the liver consistent with old inflammorty disease. With the way my Dr spoke to me after these results; it seemed that she doesn't believe I had ever had the level of pain I complained of. I have been trying to lose the weight ever since I was diagnosed with hypothyroidsm and of course developed high BP due to the weight; and now type 2 diabetes. I was put on metformin about 2 months ago and it seems not long after I began to lose weight (nothing has changed as I've always been a concientious eater since diabetes does run in my family -on Dad's side); I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months and am down to 152 (yes I know still too high) however; my BP med was cut in half (I was taking 150 mg Avapro); I have been taking niacin and fish oil for 2 yrs which has done a wonderful job of controlling my cholesterol which is within normal ranges for about the same period of time. What is strange is my lower # still seems a bit high - today at the Dr. it was 112/90. About 3 weeks ago I had what is being called an allergic reaction to a med I had been taking for about 2 weeks - wellbutrin to stop smoking. The rash started in a small place; intensified into more like weeping welts and then spread everywhere except my face. I still have the rash 3 weeks later but it is much better as if it may be going away. The CT summary noted that no coronary artery disease was seen and the estimated likelihood of a flow-limiting lesion is < 1%. The CT showed and I quote ""great arteries - both aorta and pumonaries""; pericardium - normal; normal RV systolic function; LV Mass 48 gms; aortic; mitral; tricuspid & pulmonary value normal; LV wall thickness normal & all 4 chambers of normal size; ejection fraction of 71%. Ok here is the confusing part - immediately following the EF is the notation 'possible diastolic dysfunction is suggested. Consider echo'. My Dr. never mentioned this to me; it wasn't until I read my report that I saw it. Should I be concerned? Should I call my Dr. and ask why she didn't mention this? My Dad had a history of severe angina (he had 2 heart attacks and 2 strokes the second of which killed him but and thank God that was at the age of 83). Some other things the CT showed: no pericardial effusion; there are small mediatinal and hilar nodes without adenopathy/mass; mild to moderate esophageal reflux; a moderate sized hiatal hernia; mild to moderate COPD emphysema and small airway disease suggestive of asthma or bronchitis; linear and nodular abnormality within the left upper lobe advise further characterization of the lung parenchyma; spondylosis thoracic spine noted; I haven't had any other events of chest pain since last week; however; I always feel exhausted and just not right. The bloodwork she ran shows my diabetes is well controlled (fasting was down to 97 woohooo); creatine kinase 20 - low (normal 29-143); urine analysis showed trace blood; trace protein; leukocte esterace 1+ (normal is negative); WBC 10-20 (normal < or = 5) squamous epithelial cells 10-20 (normal < or =5) bacteria - moderate; hyaline cast 0-5; WB cell count 17.8 (normal 3.8-10.8); hemoglobin 15.6 (normal 11.7-15.5); menatocrit 47.6 (normal 35-45); RDW 15.2 (normal 11-15); absolute neutrophils 12;104 (normal 1500-7800); absolute lymphocytes 4;664 (normal 850-3900); My Dr. put me on an antibiotic as she stated all of the above reflects a minor infection somewhere in my body - probably urinary. I am totally baffled by the possible diastolic dysfunction and with my history for reason of hysterectomy am wondering if all of the above could possibly be some type of autoimmune disease? Sorry for the length; but no one single thing above concerns me but the combination of everything that has me concerned"	2010	2010		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 25 year old female; weighing 240 lbs. I went to the hospital last week with my asthma and they said ended taking my blood sugar because the sugar strip for my pregancy test turned brown. My blood sugar was 541. They kept me for both my asthma and the blood sugar; and ran some tests. my a1c was 7.7 which i am told is very high. They diagnosed me with type 2 diabetes. They think if i loose weight i might not need medication in the end. They sent me home on metformin and glypuride. Question 1: we splurged and had chinese food the other night at a buffet (but i still watched what I ate) I took my medication like i was supposed to and then went to walmart. We were at the buffet for at least an hour; so it was about an hour after i ate when we were walking around walmart i became very pale; felt really light headed; and very sick to my stomach. I thought maybe i ate to much; I took my blood sugar and it had dropped to 60. It was 126 before dinner. So what happened? I am so confused. Question 2: I feel kinda lost about the ranges I should be at. They said when I get up in the morning it should be between 70 and 120. Pre-meal (which is when I am supposed to test) should be 130 and under and if i ever test after a meal (2 hours) it should be 180 and under. Then they said to be careful it doesn't get to low. what is considered low. I know 60 is. Question 3: This kinda go with the last question. last night i took the wrong bus and ended up acouple a towns up from where I live. I ended waiting at the police department waiting for a ride home. I started feeling really light headed; and i had a fast heart beat. I thought maybe my blood sugar was getting low again since the last time i ate was at 2 and at this point it was 9 pm. When I checked my blood sugar it read 102; which i didn't think was low... any ideas on what was going on? Question 4: Last question; I promise. I just want to make sure my numbers are looking okay cause like I said; Im confused.all numbers are pre-meal unless stated otherwise. Friday 10- @7:41 am: 60 @6:34 pm: 166 (2 days after the hospital last day on stariods for asthma) Sat. 11- @7:58 am: 56 @9:35 pm: 136 Sun 12- @7:05 am: 72 @10 pm: 113 Mon 13- @7:45 am: 49 @4:09 pm: 105 @9:47 pm: 80 Tues 14- @7:22 am 87 @5:55 pm: 126 (this was the night it dropped to 60 around 7 pm) Wed 15- @7:24 am 81 @7:23 pm: 129 (stopped taking glypuride thought it could be the cause of drops) Thurs 16- @7:45 am: 86 @9 pm: 102 This morning at 7:50: 104 I appreciate any help and I am sorry for asking so many questions. I was gave as many details as possible cause I saw thats what someone suggested. Thanks again.	2010	2010	24	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	As many already know I am a G3a 2x non responder. Twice never been UND. Not bad for an apparently easy to treat geno type. Now if you are a non G1 non responder there isn’t much out there specific to your genotype. If fact looking for reasons for non response in non G1s just does your head in. Below is what I have learnt about NR. I don’t look at Genotype much now I look more at what the virus does to us and how we contribute. I look for what is common among NRs and what is different between NRs and SVRs. Genotype doesn’t have much to do with that. There are numerous virologic and host factors have been identified that impact the likelihood of SVR. Viral factors impacting SVR • Treatment Response (RVR; cEVR) • HVL -HCV RNA above 800;000 IU/mL More recent studies suggest above 400;000 IU/mL impacts SVR • Genotype 1 Among host characteristics; that been demonstrated to decrease the rate of SVR • Age • Age at Infection • Length of Infection • Sex • Cirrhosis; • African American race • Hispanic race • Bodyweight/Obesity • Hepatic Steatosis Other factors that decrease response rates • Alcohol • Iron Overload (Hemochromatosis) • Oxidative Stress • Insulin Resistance Below is what I have discovered about each of these negatives Alcohol Virology Journal http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/89 Effect of ethanol on innate antiviral pathways and HCV replication in human liver cells Infection with Hepatitis C virus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. With a propensity to progress to chronic infection; approximately 70% of patients with chronic viremia develop histological evidence of chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis; cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma. The situation is even more dire for patients who abuse ethanol; where the risk of developing end stage liver disease is significantly higher as compared to HCV patients who do not drink [1;2]. Moreover; HCV-infected patients who abuse alcohol have extremely low response rates to IFN therapy; but the mechanisms involved have not been clarified. To model the molecular mechanisms behind this phenotype; we characterized the effects of ethanol on Jak-Stat and MAPK pathways in Huh7 human hepatoma cells; in HCV replicon cell lines; and in primary human hepatocytes. High physiological concentrations of acute ethanol activated the Jak-Stat and p38 MAPK pathways and inhibited HCV replication in several independent replicon cell lines. Moreover; acute ethanol induced Stat1 serine phosphorylation; which was partially mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast; when combined with exogenously applied IFN-a; ethanol inhibited the antiviral actions of IFN against HCV replication; involving inhibition of IFN-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These effects of alcohol occurred independently of i) alcohol metabolism via ADH and CYP2E1; and ii) cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of ethanol. In this model system; ethanol directly perturbs the Jak-Stat pathway; and HCV replication. Ethanol did not appear to have significant effects on ISRE activity at 25 and 50 mM concentrations. However; at concentrations of 100 and 200 mM; ethanol caused statistically significant 3.0 (p = 0.03) and 5.0 (p < 0.001) fold increases in ISRE reporter gene activity; as compared to cells not treated with ethanol. The data suggest that high physiological doses of acute ethanol activate the ISRE; an IFN responsive promoter. This study is interesting because it implies a number of things 1.If you drink while on TX then you have to wait until your liver breaks down the alcohol and clears it before IFN starts working again. 2. The Anti-Viral effect of Alcohol is probably Oxidative Stress related. Not Good. 3. This could happen with other substances 4. The Don’t drink cause its like throwing fuel on to a fire brigade have some basis for their views other than the cr@p on alternative treatment sites; They may actually have a point; although the effects of Alcohol on the IFN signalling pathways were dose related; with very little impact at the lower concentrations. So once again it appears to be the quantity of alcohol not just alcohol per se. 5. Alcohol activates CYP2E1	2007	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"History: Undiagnosed/uncontrolled Diabetes since 2003... rapid weight loss of 70 lbs. without trying Hypertension; Thyroid (right half removed - noduoes) Gestational diabetes; uncontrolled tremor on right side. Diagnosed with diabetes type 2; and uncontrolled tremor (non keotic chorea-ballism) attributed to high sugars in 2013 after CT/Mri showed 2 lesions in brain. Along with tremor came occasional right side numbness/tingling of leg; arm; side of face; and back; foggy ""out of it"" feeling; resulting in getting to a chair fast or falling to the floor. No loss of consciousness. Treated with Haldol to reduce tremor; diabetes medication (metformin); and monitored. After about 2.5 mos. tremor resolved to occasional hand cupping and weakness. Symptoms above (numbness; tingling; falling) went away but are now back without the falls. Right sided heavy foot feeling; difficulty walking; numbness/tingling of right side (leg; arm; face) came back and ER trip resulted in diagnosis of TIA. MRI without contrast and with contrast showed no changes since 2013 incident. Today... total 24/7 numbness in both feet (neuropathy?) but no pain except occasional shooting/stabbing or burning sensations. Difficulty walking; feet feel heavy at times; sometimes one of both feet fall asleep while walking. General weakness; fatigue; memory problems; confusion; and feeling of something not right. At times numbness and tingling in leg; arm; and face come back... have taken blood sugar and blood pressure at these times and both are within normal range. Doc wants to take a wait and see attitude. Suggests that the symptoms that she at first thought were related to the Diabetes are NOT and might be part of a neurological problem such as Parkinson's. This is limiting the fun I should be having with my three year old! I cannot walk for long distances; at times I am having trouble driving (feeling where my foot is in space); not being able to feel whether foot is pressing down or not on gas/brake. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated!"	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello everyone...I'm new here. I like to read this forum; its very inspiring to know there are others; my age..who face smiliar issues with diabetes as I do. Every year..I've realised I go through a depressed/angry period with myself..because sometimes its very hard to control my blood sugar. I am a type 2; been diagnosed at 16; and I just turned 20. My family members cannot understand me...I dont expect them to. Sometimes I just eat like a normal person..I take tablets..Starlix and metformin. Usually I can control the bs for some days...then a few days later...Im in the 200 zone. How can I really become a serious diabetic? I smoke marijuana; because for me; it combines with my meditation and yoga..on a very spiritual level. I do not abuse it. Right now; I'm trying to avoid the urge of eating a lot after I take my smoke. I dont smoke cigarettes; and my alcohol intake is only Merlot(red wine). I am a runner 4 times for the week..and Im at my ideal body weight....130lbs for 173cm tall. My problem is control of the blood sugar; in an environment that is not very condusive for a diabetic. (having 5 other family members who eat everything). I would like to know...if there is a way to control urges. With yoga I've learnt clarity...but I cant seem to achieve control of urges. I can't EVER resist chocolates...ever. It scares me to know that in a few years...I will want children; and I know FULLY well if I dont maintain control continuously now...I will pay for it. So...I'm ready to heed to whatever advice I can be offered. Thanking you all in advance !	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have been feeling sort of down because of the prospects for me clearing this virus are dwindling up. Yes; I know; that I'm far from hopeless and that there's still time; and blah; blah; blah. But; I've basically been told that I can't do any of the protease inhibitors. I was thinking about trying to get into the Boceprevir trials; but I've been told; flat out; nobody will take me into a protease inhibitor trial because of my having been exposed to the Telaprevir in the Prove 3. I'm like; 'Oh terrific; so I'm like scr*wed?' Schering has told me this; the former trial nurse at my last study site has told me this. Whenever I inquire about the possibility of any other non-responder trials; nobody has anything available to me. I suppose that there is always hope that eventually there will be a polymerase non-responder trial; but whether or not that they will take me; is debatable. Waiting for a couple of years for one of these new drugs to be FDA approved really doesn't help me much because I have no prescription drug insurance; so I wouldn't be able to pay for them. So; I'm left with; do I just hope and pray that I progress none? Since I've had bridging fibrosis for 7 years; is that even likely? I am praying for a miracle because nothing I have tried has worked. I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad; or to just be a negative old grouch; but I'm really feeling down about this. I don't understand why I have been unable to clear! Susan400	2003	2008	46	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a type II diabetic on Metformin 750mg daily and would like to lose about 40-50 pounds in the next year. My A1C has been around 6.1 for the last 4 years; but I still have a hard time losing any wt. I belong to Curves and exercise 3-4 days a week. I try to keep my carbs at 60 per meal. Friends have lost wt using HCG injections and feel I would benefit from this; but did try HCG drops prior to my diagnosis ; and my blood sugars did go up to the 160-200 range. Strong family hx of diabetes; so want to control my blood sugars. Would I have the same problems with the shots? And would these harms my pancreas resulting in lasting problems?	2011	2011		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi folks; first time poster here in this forum. I've been taking Simvastatin for 5 years; and coincidentally during that time period my blood glucose levels have been steadily increasing from 100 to 162. My GP has told me that I have pushed thru the ceiling of an index that's used for determining risk. He has given me 90 days to pull it back; or I'm going on Metformin. I am what I would consider to be; a healthy; active; non-smoking 60 y/o male. I'm a bit overweight; but not excessive; and I don't think I go overboard on foods and drinks that would promote high glucose levels. The only change I've made in the last 5 years (other than aging!) is I'm taking Simvastatin aka. Lopressor. When I question my doctor about this; he immediately dismissed it saying the problem is with my diet. Has anyone else here notice the same; and if so could they point me to an authoritative source that I could direct him to?	2010	2011		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi all. I am female and 28 years old; I have type 1 diabetes and I am on insulin. Mostly well controlled. Last December; I started having weird stomach problems where I lost my appetite to the point where I had starvation ketones; and would feel very nauseous and ill after eating the most basic foods. (Bananas and bread). I would start shaking and need to lay down. I phoned my GP and saw a nurse; got told it was just ''acid' or ''possibly an ulcer'' and given Omeprazole. 4 days later I got worse and ended up in an out of hours doctor in hospital and got given Domperidone for anti nausea so I could start eating again. After about 4-5 days I felt much better. I stopped taking the Domperidone and finished the 28 days worth of Omeprazole and I was fine by New Year. Fast forward to about 1.5 weeks ago; I start getting weird cramps in my lower back and stomach. Appetite slowly diminishing again and not feeling right. Cramps were in my left hip and radiated just under where my belly button is. Not severe but enough to cause discomfort in bed. I started putting a pillow under my knees and my back pain is completely gone but my stomach issues are really bad. I saw another nurse; sent me away with nothing and just said to come back if it gets worse. I called my doctors AGAIN yesterday morning; spoke to a doctor who didn't even want to see me and just prescribed more Domperidone and Lansoprazole 30mg once a day. I asked about a H. Pylori test and he dismissed it saying a lot of people have it and it causes no symptoms. He said if my stomach problems come back after this medicine then I need an endoscopy. I have had NO tests apart from urine the whole time I've been suffering with this. Urine is always clear. I took my first dose of meds yesterday afternoon; managed a sandwich and a yoghurt and went to bed about 4pm. I felt slightly better and less weak as I've really not been eating. I woke up about 11pm (I am nocturnal and work mainly nights so this is normal for me); I made myself some homemade vegetable broth with bread. I had some dark chocolate and a diet soda a bit later on. (Stuff I eat/drink all the time for years and never had any issues) I took my Domperidone and still felt kinda sick and didn't want to eat; but I forced myself. About 3 hours later; I now have bright yellow; completely liquid stool that burns. I feel horrible. I don't know if I should call my doctor back when it opens; call 111 or give the medicine longer than a day to feel any different as last time Omeprazole took 5 days + Domperidone to feel 90% better. I feel like something is really wrong with me; but my doctor said yesterday on the phone; ''Nothing you are telling me is raising any alarms''. My main symptoms are: - Nausea/malaise/feeling hot and clammy shortly after eating but NEVER vomited not even once. Nausea/unwell feeling comes in waves and seems to last maybe a few seconds to a minute and then it subsides - Abdominal dull ache that seems worse when I lay down. In December this pain was in my upper central abdomen; now it's below my belly button and my stomach in general feels almost tight and achy; like it's tired. - Hungry empty feeling in my stomach - On and off diarrhea. I had a normal BM when I woke up which slowly transitioned to liquid after going 2-4 times. - Very little appetite which is causing me to feel very weak and sick from not being able to eat properly As far as I am aware; I have no food allergies. I am on Metformin and Insulin for type 1 diabetes; and I take birth control; but I've been on all of these for 5 years and had no problems whatsoever. I am really annoyed that I have sought out medical attention for this so many times; yet no one ever orders any tests to actually investigate. I can't live like this. I already had a warning from work for taking time off because my uncle went missing. I work all over the country and the thought of a 3 hour drive with my unstable stomach is making it so hard for me to function at work.	2017	2018		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Seeing Kathy73 post about being SVR reminded me about the importance of losing weight before TX. If I recall she was very sensitive about being overweight. It is great she was still able to achieve SVR. Here are some studies why losing weight before treatment is important; not to mention other health issues from being overweight. Obese patients who are treated for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are more likely to have a better outcome if the underlying abnormalities caused by excessive fat tissue are corrected first; according to a review published in the medical journal Hepatology. The lead author; Dr. Michael R. Charlton of the Mayo Clinic; Rochester; Minnesota; and colleagues point out that obesity is considered to be a metabolic condition; not simply a matter of being very overweight. Obesity in patients with HCV infection is associated inflammation and insulin resistance; a ""prediabetic"" abnormality of blood sugar. These patients may also have steatosis; ""fatty liver disease;"" progression of fibrosis; scarring of the liver; and poor response to interferon and ribavirin; the standard treatment for HCV infection. Patients with hepatitis C and obesity-related fatty liver disease are also at greater risk for more advanced liver disease. Weight loss to reduce fat tissue is an important first step in improving response to treatment; the investigators advise. Also important is treatment with diabetes drugs; such as metformin and pioglitazone; to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation in the liver. This might reverse disease progression; the researchers note. Other approaches to enhance patients' response to combination drug therapy may include longer duration of treatment and higher doses to counteract the decreased response to the drugs. Rather than basing doses on weight; they suggest; drug doses could be based on body mass index; a ratio of height to weight. ""Treatment strategies that focus on improving underlying metabolic factors associated with poor response to combination therapy;"" conclude the researchers; are ""more likely to overcome the low sustained viral response rates observed in obese patients infected with HCV."" ____________________________________________________________________________________________ According to the results of the research; type 2 diabetes (DM); obesity and hypertension (HTN) are associated with overall and liver related mortality in hepatitis C (HCV) infected patients. In HCV-infected patients; the top three predictors of liver related mortality were having higher body mass index (BMI); presence of insulin resistance (IR) and elevated serum cholesterol. Overall mortality in HCV patients was most linked to metabolic syndrome; higher BMI and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical problems that increase risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects one in five people; and prevalence increases with age. Recent data have suggested that metabolic syndrome is associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients. This study set out to assess which aspects of metabolic syndrome are of most risk to such HCV patients and to quantify their specific impact on mortality. Professor Zobair Younossi MD; MPH from the Center for Liver Diseases at Inova Fairfax Hospital and the Executive Director of Betty and Guy Beatty's Center for Integrated Research; Virginia; USA; who led the study; said: ""Exploring the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients helps us to better understand the complex nature of this highly prevalent disease. This study shows a clear association between key components of metabolic syndrome and mortality in HCV patients and demonstrates the importance of lifestyle improvements and coaching in the management of HCV patients; to potentially minimise the onset and impact of metabolic syndrome and its associated mortality risks."""	2006	2010	52	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am on elavil for supposed acephalgic complicated migraines--I started on 10mg and am now on 25mg--and the dr wants to up it to 50mg. I have gained 6lbs in the last 2 weeks after upping the meds to 25mg. Plus; my vision is still not right. I haven't had another migraine; but the one I had was without headache (I got the numbness; loss of vision; etc.). Are there any meds out there that would work for being proactive with the migraines; but not cause the weight gain??? I am not happy with the gain!!!!!!! Thanks	2010	2010		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My Dad has had Two Bypass surgerys. One when he was 45 - leaving him with a graft to his RCA and OM and a Lima to LAD. Since then 16 yrs later. He has re occluded all but the Lima graft to Lad. He had another redo bypass off pump via transthorasic and replacing graft to OM 3 - as OM1 has a 95% stenosis and aneurysm they weren't able to fix it. OM 2 was full of clots and un-viable. His native circ ;prox lad and RCA is occluded. Has minor irregular to his left main. He is diabetic - type 2 on dimacron and metformin. He has been doing well since the second bypass two years ago with his EF at 40-45%. The last two months he has been short of breathe and chest pain daily. Repeat Muga scan shows his EF now at 19%. He does drink alcohol about 3-4 glasses of rum a day despite knowing he shouldn't. He has slight renal impairment with a creat of 120-150 at times He also has had three strokes in the past - leaving him with mild weakness only to one side and poor vision. Sounds bad right !! My question is .... Does he even have much chance left to improve his EF ? Knowing most of his blood supply to the left ventricle muscle is blocked ? Is it just a matter of time ? We are feeling desperate and hoping he can get some help but also trying to be realistic. I doubt very highly he is a transplant option. Any advice or helpful suggestions would be appreciated. Even a life expectancy - whether good or bad would be nice. He's not on oxygen at this time.	2013	2013		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 53 and I have been battling with pimple type festing bumps in my head; behind ears back of neck in hair line. I was and clean up daily. I have fought several Staph infestion over the last 3 years; never had it before that. I've been to GP; and Dermertoglist. I will add my Rx; and med history below. Every time the Dr. would put me on Antibotics for my staph; and about a 1-1 1/2 all the bumps in my head would clear up. After about 2 weeks after stopping they would come back. This has happened several times. Had Amoxcillen and Bactrian. The Dermotogists started me on Bactroban Cream 2% bid. He told me that he would probably have to give me antibotics to take on a daily basis. I haven't had any Staph since I started using this cream. I'm sure all the medicines I'm on doesn't help either (see below). It don't help that I can't keep my hands off of them. But if they wasn't there I wouldn't touch them. I know it's not me picking them that is causing them; when I'm on antibotics they go away. I just haven't been able to go back to Dermotoglist because low of funds. Any help is appriecated.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My resident doctor put me on Actos30 with long injection of Lantus in evenings. I was on Actos and rejected it early in the year...because; now as before; it caused me to swell; especially in the middle of my body. I woke up in night needing to go to the bathroom; none of my clothes fit. When I beat my mid-area like King Kong; I was playing a drum!!! And; mentally; I was ready to kill!!!! A week ago I didn't realize that pill had fallen on the floor and when I found it next morning; determined it was an act of God! I felt better even by Tuesday evening. Today; I have no urgency and have lost the major bloat--but BS is about 15 points higher and won't go below 215 on FAST. I feel like my doctors are not experts in treatment--understudies...and I have asked to be referred to an endochronologist--but it hasn't happened yet. I see internal medicine primary care doc on Sept. 2. I can't take metformin (it put me in hospital 5 years ago when I wasn't Type 2...inflammed colon from all the diahhrea! Any input on this? All my 4 siblings have Type 2...I am oldest; but last to develop it...but on top of it all; I have PCOS--double trouble for diabetes! Thought appreciated!	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My husband had what we thought was a heart attack last wednesday after getting to the ER & being transferred to another hospitail in another city; they did a Nuclear Scan; Stress test & concluded he had blocked arteries so they scheduled to go up his groin & probably put Stints in. When they did the procedure they found that they could not do the stints or anything for that fact. They said he had Aneurysm's in all his Arteries & severe placque build up. So we went home the next day (he was in the hospital for 4 days); And he was put on Baby Aspirin; Lipitor 40 mg once a day; his Diabetes medicine & continue to not smoke which he quit on that Wednesday. We are too see his new Cardologist on 8/30/12; but people seem to be thinking they know so much & that he should be in the hospital; he should feel 100% better in 3 short days; along with a mulitude of other things; we need a second opinion when we haven't even been able to talk to his Cardiologist yet; can you tell me if all of this sounds correct that he should be doing so far?	2012	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I found my blood sugar at 17.8 last night. I have a lot of symptoms like palpitation; dizziness and very tired. I took 2.5mg of the minidiab. After that; I have a packet of bean curd puff and some dry longan (dry fruit). After 3 hours; I went to bed. This morning I take my blood sugar again before breakfast (fasting). It is 6.2. I'm curious; is 2.5mg of minidiab really can lower the blood sugar that much? Or my meter something wrong......? Again after 2 cups of coffee; I felt very very dizzy. I take my blood pressure; it is 112/85. My chest is very tight; it looks like an elephant sitting on it. Were these symptoms are part of the blood sugar 17.8 which damaged to my organ? Or could be my blood sugar raises to 17.8 again? I think it is impossible for 2 cups of white coffee without sugar can raise the blood sugar so much! Just too scare to do another blood glucose test. Any one has those experience or come across those symptoms? Could some one give me an idea what should I do next?	2005	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I've recently been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes and started testing my blood glucose at home with the One Touch Ultra 2 monitor. The test strips that I've been given are pre-coded; so I do not have to do anything to my monitor prior to testing; other than insert the strip. I have a couple of questions and I apologize if they sound stupid - I'm still trying to get used to all of this - I've only been diagnosed and testing for a little over a month: 1) Can/will your blood sugar reading vary depending on which finger you use for the sample? A few times; especially today; I noticed a vast difference between the middle finger on my right hand and the middle finger on my left hand. For example; I was feeling a bit shaky like maybe my sugar levels were low; so I tested using the middle finger on my left hand - it read 62. To double check; I then did a test on the middle finger of my right hand (about a minute after the first test) and got a reading of 143 (I had not eaten or drank anything in between tests or for several hours before the tests). This is not the first time this type of ""difference"" has happened; although this was the most drastic difference. It's not always a difference between left and right hands - sometimes simply different fingers on the same hand 2) Because of this vast difference; how do I tell which is the most accurate; so I know how to treat and/or notify my doctor? I'm currently taking Metformin and Glimepiride and of course; if my sugar is already low; I don't want to make it any lower by my meds - but if I'm getting conflicting readings; how do I tell? 3) Is it better to always use the same finger for testing or better to switch fingers each time? Of course; I'd rather my fingertips not get sore from testing; but if it's better/more accurate to always use the same finger; I'll put up with a little tenderness. Any other tips for the most accurate testing would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"	2009	2011	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello~I have not been diagnosed as a diabetic; and my last A1C was 5.8. However; lately; my morning fasting levels have been higher than normal and I am worried. My doctor says it is stress related as I am releasing a lot of cortisol; but; still; I am concerned. My stresses are: starting college soon; taking some tests; my fiance having major surgery; illness in the family.I am 52 years old; and try to eat right. My morning readings used to always be in the 80's; then; two weeks ago the night before my boyfriends surgery; I checked it before bed; and it read 154; I could have fainted; just two hour previously; it was 110. The next morning; 5/4 instead of being in the 80's; it was 106 fasting for 9 hours;(this was the day of his surgery); it finally went down that night to the 80's again. The day after that; 5/5; it was 105 and stayed there all day; after I ate a low carb meal; it went to 122 two hours after. The next morning; 5/6 it was 98; I don't mind that. Well; on 5/7; I woke up with a horrible tummy ache; the docs think now it was food poisoning; I was sick as a dog; I took my sugar at 4 in the morning thinking it was too low; but; dang; it was 148; I had eaten some tums however prior to that and they are full of sugar. It stayed elevated until 10:32 that morning; and my fasting was 118. The next mornings; 5/8 through 5/12; my fasting was in the 90's; then yesterday; on the 13th; it went up again to 102; I had some school tests and such coming up and was nervous. This morning; the 14th; it was 107. So; as you can see; I have been a mess. I charted all this and gave it to my doctor; she said not to worry; that it was stress related and the more I worry; the higher it will go; also; my period started yesterday; and I understand this can elevate it too. In the past; I have always been hypoglycemic; so; this is new to me. I guess I should try not to worry; get more exercise and keep a record for a few weeks before I panic. My boyfriend has just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; so now I am more nervous about it; his numbers; however were awful; the doc got him at over 470; he is doing better though and sticking to his diet and his metoforim is really helping. Anyway; have any of you had the numbers fluctuate like me and been told it is stress? I am in high anxiety right now; and I am really worried. I also have irregular heart beats; GERD; and panic attacks; so; I am a member of many forums. My chiropractor helps a lot as does my acupuncture treatments; but; I still worry. Thanks for reading this. Susie	2007	2010	52	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Just received results and am trying to decide whether to push Dr for referral or let it ride for now. Do have symptoms but Dr. is fairly resistant to treating thyroid. TSH: Aug. 2.5 0.450-4.50 Sept. 3.090 0.450-4.50 T4 Sept 7.6 4.5-12.0 T3 uptake 26% 24-39 Free Thyroxine Index 2.0 1.2-4.9 Thyroglobulin antibody 1.1(H) 0.0-0.9 Thyroid Peroxidase(TPO)Ab <5 0-34 I thought there was a T3 test in there and if there was it was 3.8; I think but can't remember the reference range except to say is was shaded towards the lower side. Will call again and see if they actually did do one or not. May have been mistaken or another test. So; does this look fairly normal? TIA!	2014	2014		Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hmmm; I'm just looking for advice on what kind of doctor I need to see to pursue this problem. I am a 51 yr old female with Type 2 Diabetes and currently taking glucophage 1000mg once daily. Saw my PCP for ""memory loss"" and she ran tests revealing a vitamin B12 deficiency; went in weekly for 4 wks for shots; then every 3 wks. In researching this problem; I've found that many symptoms I have experienced for years can be attributed to this deficiency which include: daily headaches that feel like I've been pounded on the top of my head w/a hammer that feels like it goes down through my c-spine and into my back which seem to improve right after the injection but come back toward the end of the 3 wk period; brain fog/memory loss; joint pain; loss of enjoyment in reading because my eyes get tired and vision seems to get blurred; cannot think of words (i.e.; ""that thing you wear on your head"" for ""hat""); some occasional numbness in left arm; right shoulder pain; and am unsteady in the dark (especially going down stairs) I was also recently dx'd with an anal fissure from chronic diarrhea I've experienced for many (5+) years. Many endo/colon-oscopies that show everything to be fine in that dept - no colitis (but w/fissure and B12 deficiency I suspect maybe Crohn's?) but have been on Prevacid since 1999 for severe GERD. I had my most recent injection last week; but had B12 level checked prior to receiving shot. PCP called to tell me that for someone who gets injections monthly it isn't very high - 310. So...what kind of specialist do I need to see? A hematologist or a neurologist? She thought I should see the GI guy to r/o Crohn's but I'm a little worried about the B12 level at this point and my memory loss. I used to be a ""sharp cookie"" but it's fading fast... Any ideas?"	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi all; My husband is at week 25 of his 3rd tx try; this time with Alinia added. He has compensated cirrhosis so there is an urgent reason to succeed. The Alinia has made him a much better responder but it is still falling short as he is responding too slow. It was planned to have him stop after the 24th week if he wasn't nondetectible. At 20 weeks his viral load was 207 and at week 24 it was 250...not good. The doctor's office called and said not to quit yet and we have an appointment on December 2nd to decide what to do. The reason they decided not to stop right now was because his ALT came back as ""18"" which was certainly a beautiful number to behold. The treatment has made him sick with lots of nausea most of the time and he looks like a wreck at this point but we know it is a long wait until Teleprevir comes out and we sure don't want to leave any stone unturned if there is any chance of success. Does anyone have any brilliant ideas to push Joe to nondetectible? Yes; I'm asking for a miracle. We sure would appreciate prayers. Thanks; Ev"	2007	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Is there any way medication which people with pcos can take to help them with weight loss? What i have read suggests that the only way to control it is through diet and exercise. I'm asking because my friend who has recently been told that it is likely she may have PCOS goes running for an hour a day and never eats heavily but still manages to put on weight easily. e.g last week she put on over a stone despite exercising and eating well everyday. There isn't a lot more she can do to control her weight even if the PCOS s confirmed (is curently waiting a scan). Btw; she has been seeing her doctors for years now about her struggle to lose any weight and also has irregular periods; some acne and problems with regular bad stomachs/tiredness. Any help much apprecated as she's very depressed about it.	2010	2010		Male

I also have hemochromatosis ; diabetes (type 2) and extremely high blood pressure which I take meds for the last two (diovan hct; mepropolol; and metformin and zocor for cholestoral); and have had regular phlebotomies (blood letting); for the last year and a half; finally getting my iron levels down to acceptable levels for the hemochromatosis. My doctor is monitoring my heart now and says it is just best to follow this course and hope that the blockage dosent increase.My questions are these; do you think the hemochromatosis can have had an effect on my heart; I understand that it can cause heart failure? Can this lead to a heart attack? I wonder if surgery will ultimatley be an option; and what can I expect for the future?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am having trouble keeping my thoughts straight so bear with me plz. Tegretol did not work out and I am now on haladol. What older antipsychs are left on the list? I cannot concentrate right now long enough to do the research myself. I need the antipsych to function as I become paranoid and delusional w/o them. My dr will not or cannot discuss treatment strategies for the future w/me if this fails also. I feel like my back is up against the wall and am feeling pretty hopeless at this point. I was on Navane before the new anti psychs came out so I know there are others and I think I was taken off it just to put me on the newer drugs - too many years ago to remember what happened.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Ima write EXACTLY what it says in the magazine! A decade ago Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) was a little known; and little understood condition. Today its the most common hormonal disorder among women of repoductivve age and the main cause of infertility in UK women. What's more; some experts believe that Polycystic Ovaries might affect as many as one in four women;; and that the number of sufferers is likely to rise further; thanks to modern life styles. Polycystic Ovaries are caused by a large number of Cysts (Fluid filled sacs) that grow just below the surface ofone or both ovaries. When a woman displays some or all of the collection of symptoms normally associated with Polycystic Ovaries she is said to suffer from PCOS. GP an author; Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'With PCOS; the ovaries produce too many male hormones; such as testosterone which block the normal monthly growth and development of egg follicles; creating the cysts. Most women with Polycystic Ovaries are less responsive to insulin; the hormone that regulates blood sugar; putting them at an increase of Diabetes. 'The main symptoms include oily skin or acne; increased facial or body hair and thinning hair on the scalp. 50% if sufferers are overweight or obese and 70% of women with PCOS have light or irregular; or miss periods' Not only is PCOS a ticking time bomb for the future of our fertility; if left unchecked; its also linked to serious health issues; such as Type 2 Diabetes; heart disease; and endometrial cancer. The statistic most quoted is that One in Ten women have PCOS: says Norah Lane; founder of Diet Care. 'But the real number is likely to be much higher. One in four women is thought to have Polycystic Ovaries; but they may not display any symptoms or not make the connection between the smptoms they are experiencing and the condition. Many women don't get diagnosed with PCOS untill they start trying for a baby; and; even then they might have been trying to conceive for some time before seeking help. It's no wonder that the latest figures sow that more women than eer are undergoing fertility treatment in the UK' Natalie Cassidy and Jools Oliver (Famous peeeeeeoples) who have been diagnosed with PCOS; both gave birth in the last few weeks. Both have spoken out about thir struggles to convieve; making their new arrivals a double blessing. Other stars with PCOS include Victoria Beckham; Tana Ramsay and Zoe Ball. The Trigger for PCOS is unclear but most experts think genetics plays a role; since it tends to run in families. There is NO cure; But symptoms can be managed with some lifestyle adjustments. 'A lot of the symptoms of PCOS can be improved by diet; exercise and supplements:' Says Dr Brewer. Follow a low GI diet because balancing blood sugar leels can improve insulin resistance; Try to lose excess weight - even a modest loss of about 1 st (6kg) can correct hormonal abnormalities; reduce acne and unwanted hair and improve fertility. Regular exercise helps to overcome insulin resistance in muscle cells and can also improve mose PCS symptoms. GPs sometimes perscrie a drug called Metformin which can imporve insulin sensitivity.' If you suspect you might suffer from PCOS; speak to your GP. 'You don't have to put up with your symptoms;; says Norah. 'There's lots you can do to help yourself.' What can you do? 'Medication may help in the short term; but in the long run; healthy eating is the single biggest way to improve the symptoms' Says Dietcare founder Norah Lane. 'PCOS is a hormone imbalance and sufferers are particularly senstive to all the chemicals we are expsed to in our modern lives. Avoid porcessed foods and buy organic whenever possible.' 'You can also try eating tiny a tiny piece of protein such as chicken; turkey; egg; fish cottage cheese every 15 minutes;' advises Norah; 'These can help to speed up the metabolism; provide essential vitamins and stop hunger pangs. Other PCOS- friendly foods include strawberries; raspberries; blueberries and organic vegetables.; Dr Sarah Brewer says: 'Supplements that might help to alleviate symptoms include evening primrose oil; isoflavones; magesium supplements; B Vitamins; Chromium; and Angus Catus. Saw Palmetto may be suggested but should only be taken by women under thee supervision of a medical herbalist.' This is in England but it might help with others with the info I found out... the Figures of people having it are based in England no where else... Hope this helps?? x	2010	2010	16	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My husband went to a doctor in mid April with pain in his feet. At that time he was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes; high blood pressure and thyroid issues. Since that time; he has brought his glucose levels down to normal range (4-7) and remains on Metformin; Crestor; Lyrica; Synthroid and sometimes Gluconorm. Although his levels including his blood pressure have dropped to normal range; his feet continue to feel like they are in a vise. Sometimes it changes so they barely hurt at all but those periods are less frequent as time passes. Currently; he is in incredible pain almost continually and gets no relief. There are also episodes of tingling; burning and sensitive skin in his arms as well as his feet and calves. It feels best when he is standing although that is painful too just less so. Tylenol 3's do nothing for him and he is in agony. MRI has shown some minor ""delineation in his spinal sheath""? and we currently await ""another"" neurologist to look at the results to determine if it could possibly be the onset of MS or whether it is possible that it may be diabetes related. What can he do for the pain? He is going crazy....."	2008	2008	52	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I am 23 years old and about 9 months ago I was told I have PCOS. I believe I have had it since I started having periods since I had many of the symptoms. The only symptom I never experienced (until recently) was weight gain. All growing up I was a very small child and throughout high school I was the same. My highest weight in high school was no more that 110lbs. I have never struggled with weight; until a few years ago. After I got married (and our eating habits only changed for the better) and shortly before marriage; I started putting on the pounds. Quickly! Within 5 months I had put on 30lbs then three months later 40 more! I couldn't believe my eyes. I never had this issue before! That's when I saw my OB; after being diagnosed I was told I needed to lose weight because thats what caused the PCOS; but I don't believe it; it just doesn't add up to me. Why the sudden weight gain? They lectured me and lectured me because I want to get pregnant and am obese now. All I have been told so far is I have to lose the weight; but I am exercising and eating right and I see nothing! I was put on Metformin 500mg 2X a day after being diagnosed and I have seen no change in weight or facial hair! I am frustrated because I hate the way I feel being this large. I guess my main question is are there ANY success stories out there of women losing weight with PCOS and taking metformin? I could really use some encouragement. I want so bad to start our family; but if I am this uncomfortable being my weight now; I fear how I will feel being pregnant.	2010	2010	22	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Ok so first I'm 32 years old and 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed type 2 diabetes; I have been taking Metformin 500mg twice a day for 2 weeks with no side effects. This morning I was especially happy to find my blood sugar at 115 been below 200 since I started medication but then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and took my shirt off and BAM! both armpits had very dark blue in the middle yellow on the edges bruises; so big they took up the entire pit and some of the arm! Well I called my Dr who was going to call me back; 2 hours later I'm scared reading about leukemia (dad just got through with his treatments) and said to hell with this i'm going to shower. I took a very hot shower; the Dr called an hour after I got out; were talking and while I have her on the phone I go to look at them again to describe them and TAH DAH! All gone; and I dont mean slightly faded I mean gone; like magic. Did the Hot water do it? Did an hour do it? Please if anyone knows anything let me know.	2015	2015		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Saw hepatologist finally. Labs good; physical exam good. Geno 1a VL 2.5 iu/ml. Contracted 1988 from a blood transfusion. Dr requested more labs (pt/ptt/hiv/hbv/hav...) to make sure I am ok to schedule for my first biopsy (YUCK). I asked her about my fatigue (which I have had for years and attribute to my busy life) and I asked her about my headaches (which I have had for about a year now and have tried many drugs with no luck). She said probably not HCV related? This is contrary to what I have read? She also explained to me that treatment will be based on the damage already done. Meaning if on a scale of 1-10 in 20 years I have only advanced to a 3 in damage she would recommend not treating because new drugs should be out within the next 10 years. My question is what if my body decides to accelerate damage now since I am almost 40yo. My thought is I should still treat to reduce the VL or I could participate in a clinical trail? Advice from the experienced Heppers please to help me understand why I should decide not to treat. THANX	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was giving myself shot 6. I have a little glass thing of the peg/inter. Im suspose to undo the needle covering and slide it on the glass vial. I did that. I made sure there was no air in it a drop of fluid was on needle. I worked up the nerve to stick it in. when I started to put it in. some came out of the cap thingie. I stopped. Made sure it was on better and finished. But I felt fluid run down prior to fixing. Now I have no way of actually knowing how much I wasted.. I never do get out any extra (if there is any?) because I cant see the writing on it. Ive been contemplaiting what I should do. Should I give myself a little more? I would hate to fail tx. because some came out of the part that attaches. And why is it even like that? My vet gives me needles that are eighter attached or screw on. And that would prevent spillage.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Where to start??? Ok I am a 37 year old male. Former cocaine addict. 4 years clean. Thank God. 2 1/2 years ago I started getting these symptoms. It felt like a Head cold. Felt like wet forehead (inside). Couldn't concentrate; sometimes confused low ambition; poor memory; cranky. Lose track of what I was doing. Gazing alot. Ears slightly blocked; tingling in different parts of my head. Just like a head cold. Here is my problem!!! It has never left!! I was convinced it was a head cold because of the blocked ears wet tingling sensations etc... So I went to doctor; he thought it was anxiety or stress induced. New changes in my life; moved to new town; off drugs; new business etc.. So he prescribed celexa. I am no longer cranky; more calm; but other symptoms are still here. Then 1 year ago was my worst year. Could hardly work. Tired constantly; bone dry tongue; eyesight blurry. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. So I take metformin. 500mg 2times a day. Symptoms are still here. I am not tired any more. I can make it through the day; no problem. I seem to need about 10 hours sleep. I have problems with insomnia. I take an over the counter sleeping aid often (Unisom; by Pfizer). So I am left with the can't concentrate; bad memory; low ambition; forgetfulness; ears slightly blocked can't focus on work. I have my own business again starting up. I had lost my old business due to the tiredness from the diabetes I didn't know I had for 6 months. I am scared that I can't handle the full time business again. What is this head cold thing?? I started thinking it was to do with nervous system; or immune system. It really feels like a head cold I never get healed from. So much so; sometimes it gets worse and when people talk load my ears cut out. Is there fluid in my head that won't go away? I need to live a normal life again. I feel disabled. I am only 37 and want to start getting healthy but have no motivation. Someone please help. I forgot to mention I also gained 30 pounds that has never left when symptoms started 2 1/2 years ago. I am 195lbs 5.5 height. Right now my head is tingling and ears slightly blocked; can't concentrate etc... I got bells palsy also 4 years ago. It left within 3 months. Please help.	2007	2007	37	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Well; the symptoms I was having prior to my last post about the MRI news and the Rasmussen's Encephalitis dx probability and what happened from there. The day after I posted; I got a call from my doctor's ofc which said my hemoglobin was 7.4 and I needed transfusions asap. I had to enter the hospital cause they couldn't fit me in as outpatient and that way I could see a neurologist about the MRI results. Prior to that; I'd been having light headed spells; weakness; and right leg pain; plus aphasia. After I got some blood; the hemoglobin didn't go up much; so I got a second transfusion. I had asked for some antibody tests for diabetes the last time I had labs and finally found out they were positive which meant I do have type 1 - NOT type II. Talk about frustration!!! If I didn't research my own illnesses and ask for my own tests - I'd be dx with the wrong things. It does make me upset. The diabetes just wasn't making any sense. My diet; weight; history etc. just didn't fit with type II and did fit with LADA - Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults. It means I may need insulin asap to keep from destroying all my B cells. Of course that means another uphill fight. As far as the neurologist - he said he'd never seen RE in anyone - much less an adult - so in his gut he didn't think I had it. It was too rare! I wondered if he'd looked at my chart - I'm the essence of RARE cases. The MS shows increased lesions but none enhanced ; but the hemangioma and degeneration of the junction of the spine at the foramen magnum is frightening. I didn't think that much of it cause everything pales in comparison to the RE. We're going to do a follow up MRI in 2 - 3 months. While I was in there; I had an EEG; an LP; an MRI; and MRA; and Upper Endoscopy to try again to find a bleed. The Hematology - oncologist thinks I just fail to absorb iron and gave me an iron infusion (which I've had before with no problem) However; this time; I had a massive bilateral backache and a soaring BP so they had to stop and give me a different kind. I'll have to get them once a week basically forever - with breaks. I will also have IVIG infusions - high dose for 5 days straight then once a month forever. This will hopefully help a lot of things. But; frankly; I think I don't have much time. My Blood glucose went to 213 while fasting over 30 hours and when I got home; I was sweating so bad during the night; I tested and it was 254! I'm quite concerned. My insulin levels are low; c-peptides low; and GAD high - Autoimmune Diabetes. WHAT Autoimmune disease DON'T I have?? I've slept pretty much since I got home Sat night; so have to arrange things tomorrow to start these new treatments. I've gotten so weak on my right side (and left - just not as much) and the aphasia scares me big time. It's embarrassing to not be able to talk well. Having things that doctors don't know about and that research says has to be treated early puts a lot of pressure on me. I can't see the best doctors due to having Medicaid and it's getting really frustrating cause there's no one else to ask. Blessings everyone. I thought I'd update and vent a bit. I need it.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I've been suffering from Hypothyroid for over a decade now and I've been on the Synthroid since they found it. It helped mostly I never felt %100 again but it was a lot better then how I was feeling before. Back in 2010 things began to change again the symptoms all came back but even worse this time I put on over 100lbs in less then three months my hair; nails and skin dried out so badly I started losing them hair and nails I mean and my skin was so dry it was splitting open because I was gaining so much much weight and my skin was so dry it couldn't handle it now I'm covered in major scars. I've seen nearly half a dozen doctors since because they kept sending me to see one doctor at one clinic then they would send me to see this other doctor at this other clinic they even sent me to see a doctor in another city 3 hours away and had more tests then I can count. One day everything seems ""normal"" the next day my cortisol and ASTH are not even detectable and my prolactin levels are sky high then by the next blood tests everything is back to normal light nothing it wrong My TSH and T3 and T4 levels never change no matter how low or high they change my Synthroid dose to and lastly my Insulin levels are around 720 with a normal fasting glucose. I have had 3 MRI's which showed no masses on the pituitary gland I do however have three large nodules on my thyroid which do cause a lot of pain horse voice and choking that are apparently not in the way according to my last surgeon even tho I feel like I'm being stabbed in the neck all the time. I'm always tired; weak; sore; lazy; grumpy; dizzy; confused; sweaty; constipated; cold; dry hair skin and nails and I always have massive headache. I take my synthroid and metformin every day I'm Canadian so I can walk in to any doctors office any time and get as many tests as I like for free if anyone can give me any insight that me or my last 6 Endocrinologists haven't thought of I would be forever in your dept."	2009	2016	38	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 32 years old and have had sensory neuropathy for the last 2 months over my entire body. It began in my feet and rapidly spread throughout my legs; up through my torso and from my shoulders down; then up into my neck. This occurred over a few days. After several trips to my doctor and eventually an internal medicine doctor; then neurologist; no one could figure out a reason. I have type 2 diabetes and was officially diagnosed 4 months ago; but it is in control. The internal med doctor initially suspected Guillain Barre'; but an EMG ruled that out (it was normal). I've had an MRI of my cervical spine and one of my brain. I've had comprehensive blood tests to rule out anything else. I'm on Metformin (for blood sugar) and Avapro (for hypertension). I recently went on these meds; about 2 months before symptoms began. The numbness seems to be a bit worse lately in my right leg and this scares me. The other neurologist I've seen recently says to take a wait-and-see approach since I have no other symptoms. I'm very worried and would like to know what is going on before the numbness spreads any further. I have two toddlers and need to expend my energy with them; not worrying about my health. Can anyone shed any light on this for me?	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I am a 49 year old mother of 2 teenage daughters. Just over a year ago I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for which I am now taking Metformin 500mg a day. I am also taking meds for high cholesterol and high BP. I am taking Thyroxine for Hypothyroidism (under active) - Thyroxine 100mcg daily - a condition that I have had since 1997. I am 3 stone over weight at 13stone 7lbs (and need to lose it). I have also had the condition PCOS since the early 1990's; which caused me fertility problems; for which I needed some medical intervention with. I have what is called I suppose 'Metabolic Syndrome' and find it so hard to lose the weight - although I should also exercise more. My worry is that for a few years now and moreso recently I have experienced slight burning sensations with dull pain on the left side of my chest radiating into my shoulder blade and arm. This happens intermittently and there is no pattern to it at all. I am worried because of all the above problems that I might be developing heart disease? I have had ECG's done in the past which are always normal and I also did an exercise stress test; which was also all normal (approx 2 yrs ago). Also for a few years now I have experienced pain that generally starts in the base of my throat and can radiate to my jaw; teeth; sometime ears and down into across my chest and can last for 5 to 20 mins. My doctor thought it was osophogeal spasm and sent me for a barium swallow - which ws normal - could this be related?	2008	2010	48	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 51 year old semi overweight woman. In the past few months I have been diagnosed with: Diabetes Type 2; Acid Reflux; Hypertension. I also have Asthma and nasal allergies for years. I am on Metformin twice a day; Nasonex spray once a day; Proventil asthma pump when needed; Aciphex once a day; I was on Quinapril once a day; but since the cough they took me off of that and put me on Diovan once a day. OK here is the problem. When I started the Quinapril over 2 months ago; a few weeks later I developed a tickle in my throat cough. I went to the doctor 3 weeks ago and she took me off the Quinapril (she said it was causing the cough) and put me on Diovan and said the cough should stop. It has not stopped. I can't even go to the movies without coughing. I get these coughing fits to the point that I sometimes gag and throw up the last meal I ate. I am constantly sucking on sugar free cough drops. I have also taken two bottles of sugar free cough syrup and nothing seems to work. Some nights I can't even sleep. I am wondering if it could be something else. I also have had HPV for a few years and read that it can affect your throat. I got back to the doctor in 2 weeks. What should I ask her to do?	2009	2009	51	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I had a colonscopy about a year ago and my bowel movements right after the procedure changed to small ball bowel movements for a year now. The colonoscopy was fine. I have been taking fiber and drinking about 8 glasses of water a day to see if this will improve my stools. So far the fiber has not helped. I have diabetes; type 2 and take Metformin and Glyburide. I also take Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure. I was drinking a soy powder drink for a year and stopped around the time I had the colonoscopy so my diet has changed. I no longer have the soy in my diet. I have heard the colonscopy prep liquid (I had ot drink a gallon of this) in some cases causes kidney disease. I am also concerned about this prep liquid and want to know if it can cause the small ball bowel movements (rabbit pellet type)? I am post-menopausal and quit taking my monthly birth control pills. The water I drink at work is hard water (perhaps a lot of lime in it). What should I do and what may have caused this? Also is the colonoscopy pre liquid to blame for this? Do I need to do a colon cleanse? How can I get my bowel movements back to normal size? Very scare and concerned.	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 50 year old woman with Type 2 Diabetes; which is under control with diet and medication (Metformin 500mg 2x daily). I'm obese and have had numerous other health problems including IBS; Hypothyroidism; hx borderline Ovarian Cancer (prognosis for that is excellent); hx abdominal surgeries for hernias and hysterectomy; severe arthritis in spine and right knee; etc. For several years my left knee has been acting up off and on. I injured both knees within a week or each other after falling in '95. The right one is in bad shape - basically bone against bone - and cortisone shots didn't help; nor did those ""flector"" pads. My left knee can get screwed up rather quickly in that all it can take is to get out of the tub the wrong way or turn the wrong way; and ping - unbearable pain where I can hardly walk. That pain usually subsides after I've been walking for a little while. My left knee can act up for several days in a row and then be like nothing happened for a long time. This pain can be sporadic. The inside of my left ankle is quite swollen and there are times when that foot (or the other one) is very painful to step on. Sudden severe foot pain pops up when I least expect it. I was running errands yesterday morning and was getting ready to cross the street when my right foot got suddenly painful to the point where I had to pause. My left foot; however; can be very painful w/o walking and the toes can be numb at times. A few years ago (when I weighed less than I do now and did alot of walking) my feet would develop this ""pins and needles"" type sensation if I walked a long way. Anyway;. lately I noticed that sometimes my left leg will hurt from between my knee and ankle. The more I exercise; whether it be housework or just plain walking; it usually gets better. However; if I try to prop up that leg on my bed or chair; it can hurt like crazy. The pain seems to be worse after getting out of bed or having sat in a cramped position for a time. My car died last year; so I have to take the bus. If I'm stuck up front where there's little leg room; it can be very painful to get up and walk once I reach my stop. Could this be arthritis or something worse; like PAD? I don't have cardiovascular issues that I know of. I do see a cardiologist on a yearly basis for checkups because of my weight and family history of heart disease. Mom died of a massive heart attack in '99 at the age of 58. I have nuclear stress tests periodically and I passed each one with flying colors; the most recent one being this past May. My cholesterol has always been excellent; and my bp is usually good; although a few times in the past year they said it was borderline. No meds for that so far; just monitoring by my doctors. Thoughts; anyone? I'd hate to think that my arthritis has progressed to the point where I can barely walk. I have a sedentary lifestyle which I admit doesn't help. Because of my weight; arthritis and gut issues; there are times when I use those electric carts at the store. I felt better (pain-wise) when I was more active. I face the possibility of having weight loss surgery at the same time I'm going to have my latest hernia repaired; but that hasn't been decided yet. I would prefer to lose weight the old-fashioned way if possible like I did many years ago. At my heaviest I was well over 450. I'm nowhere near that now but have a long ways to go. Diana"	2007	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	what effectiveness and safety do sam-E; NAC; milk thistle; choline have in treating NAFLD and anesthesia liver poisoning? I'm on large doses of these and my levels are almost normal; but I still don't have any appetite and feel nauseous after I take the supplements like milk thistle there seem to be some new studies that show that sam-E and vitamin E are good for liver diseases	2011	2013		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Why is it that sometimes my blood sugar levels rise after walking. First thing in the morning;about an hour after exercise and not eating anything my b/s level goes up by about 4-5 points.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have a couple of questions with a lot of history to help anyone who can answer (or suggest; lol). First; in October of last year; I thought I had a miscarriage. * I was more than 2 weeks late with my period (which is bang on one month plus one day [so if it was September 10th it would be October 11th the next time]). * I was experiencing a bit of nausea around 2:30 pm every day; a drop in my appetite; and a decrease in what was appetizing for me. I could only eat plain foods (e.g. cottage cheese and rice cakes) as opposed to anything with stronger flavors or spice (it would make me vomit). * My breasts were very sore; had a bit of discharge (whitish/yellow; very pale; no odor) and swollen - my bras were no longer fitting. * We had a positive stick test; and a negative blood test (stick test was taken the day before the blood test). * The day after the blood test; my ""period"" started. However; it came on very suddenly; lasted 10 days; with no relief in flow (very thick blood; heavy cramping and pain); whereas my normal periods are 3 days: 1 day spotting; 1 day light flow; 1 day spotting. They are usually pain free; with no side effects (except that I crave dark chocolate). My period didn't come back until December; and was exactly 2 months and 1 week ""later"" than my normal schedulae would be. That period was normal (3 day cycle). Since then it has been erratic; often more than 5 days later each month; and skipped in January (I had been in the ER right before Christmas due to the flu - they asked if I wanted a pregnancy test and I automatically said no; as it had been 3 months since we had ""active""). A Bit of History: Right now; I am not on any birth control. I was put on BC for the first time in January of 2001 (I started my cycle at age 11; but it stopped at 13 and didn't come back until I was on the pill in 2001; when I was 21). I had been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes (oral medications) a month before; and after discussing birth control options with my GP; she put me on Ortho Tri-cyclen. I was on that without pause until 4 years ago; when I talked to my new GP (new city). I had major pain; cramps and stabbing pains during the week that I should have gotten my period (which was hit and miss; sometimes it would arrive sometimes not). My new doc put me on Alesse; to see if that would help with the pain. I was on it for 6 months; and still had the same pains; and opted to go without birth control. Within 3 months; my period was normal; I knew when to expect it; and it was the low-flow; pain-free cycle that I have had normally for the last 3 1/2 years. In October of 2006; I was put on insulin for my diabetes. I am currently in control of my blood sugars; and all is fine in that department (according to my bloodwork). I do not use condoms due to allergic reactions to latex and various chemicals. I am married; and we have been together for 5 years now. Hubby has survived cancer twice in his youth (he is 30 now). First he had Leukemia at age 3 or 4; and then cancer of the CNS around age 6-7. He had both radiation and chemotherapy. He hasn't had too many health issues in the last 10 years; other than Bipolar (possibly); depression and anxiety; and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (though we are looking into having this properly diagnosed; as our GP hasn't properly diagnosed this). I too suffer from clinical depresion; anxiety and PTSD; as well as IBS and possibly Fibromyalgia (I am also quite overweight). Alrighty; so my questions are this: My breasts are still tender and a bit swollen (though not nearly as they were in October); and my period is wonky. I'm gaining weight like crazy; right in front; in my abdomen area; to the point my pants aren't fitting properly. I'm hvaing lower back pain (not horrible; but enough that I notice). The last time my hubby and I were sexually active was September 13th (and it had been months before that). I'm also so gassy; to the point I'm embarassed to go out; lol! I've been on Dicetel for my IBS for a year now; and have had no problems since I started it (and no problems now). I've been getting acid reflux like crazy too; which is odd for me (I used to get it maybe once a year; and it would be a one night thing; usually after spicey food). My diet is very close to the same as it was a year ago - mainly vegetarian (not much tofu though); with chicken and fish once or twice a month. I avoid processed foods as much as possible; and prefer whole grains; fresh fruit and veggies; etc. We eat as healthy as possible within our budget. I have changed my sleep patterns; as I used to be a night owl; sleeping all day and rarely seeing the sun. Over the course of a month I've switched to going to bed by midnight; and waking by 9. We go for walks every few days; roughly 1 KM each time. The medications I am currently taking are: Insulin; Metformin; Seroquel; Lipitor; Dicetel along with a women's daily vitamin and folic acid (these are for the joint and muscle pain; as I've discovered that the pain is lessened when I take them and avoid most meats). So my questions are: is it possible that I didn't miscarry in October? I will be going for blood work soon; but I don't have too much confidence in it. Is it possible that the medications I am on could be responsible for the symptoms I have? And lastly; what can I do in the future to help have a healthy pregnancy (if it's even possible)? Thanks everyone; for reading and for anyone who can offer answers or advice :)"	2008	2008	28	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello; I am hoping that someone can help me understand my recent blood work in addition to symptoms. Should I be concerned and if so; what should I be asking the doctor? Symptoms: ~ Tired; Tired; Tired! I have been known to fall asleep on the couch at 6:30 pm; wake up at 11 pm just long enough to walk into my bed and collapse again. Wake up at 6:30 a.m. feeling like I never slept at all. Due to this; exercise has already been put on the back burner. ~ Memory Loss. I can be in the middle of a sentence and can't remember what I said or what I was going to say. The same goes for emails. I used to have a knack for names and now I can barely remember my own name. ~ It is hard to be kind to people. My emotions are up and down. ~ I am always cold. Everyone else can be in t-shirts and I'm bundled up with layers that include a jacket or sweatshirt...and normally at least 2 shirts under that. ~ Unexplained weight gain. I lost a significant amount of weight (60 lbs) a couple years ago. I have continued with my habits (minus the exercise as it seems that it takes me days to recover from a simple 30 min. workout). I was 4 lbs away from my goal when I started gaining weight last year.... and it just keeps piling on. In the last month I have gained 15 lbs. Currently; I have gained everything I lost plus some. ~ I have started to pull away from people (a friend noticed that I'm not myself and I would rather be by myself these days.) ~ Hair loss! This started in 2000 and I have had biopsy's completed that has identified that the ""jackets"" are coming out as well. ~ The last couple of times I have been to my primary physician; my resting heart rate was 60; which they said was ""slow"". ~ I have been on High Cholesterol medication since I was around 18 years old. No matter what I do I can't get my bad cholesterol low and my good cholesterol high. Other items to note: ~ I have PCOS ~ We have other auto immune diseases in my immediate family which includes Rheumatoid Arthritis; Diabetes; Guillain Barre; Thyroid; etc. ~ Prior TSH result was 9.11.13 @ 1.906. (same lab as the one below) ~ Only other time I have had T4 tested it was .95 (same lab as the one below - 10.27.08) ~ Only other time I have had TPO ab test it was 56 (same lab as the one below; noted as ""High; but not affecting TSH 2.16"" - 11.7.07). I was not experiencing as many symptoms at that point. Test Results: -Taken 3.13.15; Doctor failed to test for APO ab (Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies) even though she said she was going to TSH: 3.776 (0.4 - 4.0) - noted it was ""high-normal"" T3: 2.8 (2.3 - 4.2) - around 26%? T4: .97 (0.84 - 1.51) - around 19%? -Taken 4.23.15; Doctor hasn't been on top of things for a while and this time failed to test T3 & T4. TSH: 2.659 (0.4 - 4.0) TPO ab: 1782.5 (0 - 60) - Yes; my results are 1;782.5! I had to look at it 5 times before I trusted it. This is also noted with ""positive for auto immune Thyroid disease"" I contacted my doctor regarding the TPO ab results since I didn't receive a call but instead received the results through the mail. The medical assistant (who spoke with the doctor) said that they will not be starting me on anything as my TSH is normal. At some point my TSH will catch up with the Antibodies & symptoms and which point they will do something. She wasn't concerned that my TSH fluctuates that much during a one month time frame because ""it fluctuates on a daily basis"". As for the symptoms...I was just going to have to weather through them.....to be honest; I'm too tired to keep weathering through them. I'm thinking I need to go get a second opinion (and change doctors as there has been a lot of warning signs that she just isn't as well on top of my health as a endocrinologist should be). What kind of doctor should I be looking for? Another Endo? A Naturopath? What should I be asking? Any guidance would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!"	2015	2015	38	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 24 year old female. For the past month or so I feel starving all the time. It's the feeling of a gurgling stomach and intense; sickening gnawing hunger pain underneath the gurgling. It makes me immediately start sweating; I get hot and feel that I'll be sick (faint; throw up; etc.) if I don't eat immediately. I run into the kitchen and drink milk and eat oatmeal; peanut butter toast; etc. Sometimes eating makes the pain go away for for maybe an hour; but then the pain starts again; and sometimes eating doesn't make the pain go away at all. I can't sleep through the night. I wake up about every 1 to 2 hours with the pain; pounding heart; dizziness and sweating. I eat a granola bar and fall back asleep for a bit until I wake up with the same thing again. Mornings are horrible. When I wake up I feel dizzy; faint; hungry; and the gnawing hunger pain in my stomach. I've gained 10 pounds because I eat all the time; and I'm don't exercise anymore because of the pain and fear that I'll faint. Other issues I'm having are: excessive gas; bloating; burping up bile; diarrhea in the mornings and increased bowel movements. I also suffer from anxiety. When I start getting the hunger feeling I worry that my blood sugar is low and that sends me into an anxiety attack. The pain also sends me into an anxiety attack because it hurts so bad and I don't know what's going on. The lack of sleep; no exercise; weight gain; constant eating; and inability to go out are ruining my life and making my anxiety worse. I've been taking 40mg of Pepcid AC every day for a month and I don't think it's helping. For the past month I drank a Slim Fast every morning; and a month's worth of Slim Fast was just recalled because they might be contaminated with Bacillus Cereus. I thought maybe that was the problem; but I haven't had a Slim Fast in about a week and my problems remain. I don't know if the two things are related or just circumstantial.	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My periods have almost always been sporadic; but I never missed more than two in a row. This past year; I noticed I'm skipping more often and when I skip; I get bad symptoms - it's like phantom PMS - for that month. August was especially bad (I skipped my period July and August) so I decided to go on the pill in September. I don't even know if I ovulated that month because I started the pill in the middle of the month. I guess it was denial for me because I was just so scared of missing 3 months in a row. Since I started on the pill mid Sept. I didn't get a chance to see if I'd get a period or not for that month; tho I had a feeling I was going to skip anyway. :( I'm actually feeling much worse on the pill. I want to see if it can help regulate things and it's supposed to help with cysts; if I have them. I had an ultrasound which showed several follicles on my left ovary; but my Dr. said he can't tell from this and wants to do more tests. I'm so scared that I have something wrong; if not PCOS than an imbalance; and my periods will just get worse when I go of fthe pill. I only want to be on it for a few months. Is it more than likely my periods will get more and more sporadic? I don't know if I have PCOS but does it really matter? I have something wrong. Every month I don't ovulate I just get so sad. I know ovulation makes women more attractive to men; and I don't have that. I've had depression and been on anti-depressants for 2 years. It could partly be related to the the irregular periods I've had since age 18. I never minded; but now it's more common for me to skip 1 and 2 in a row (I'm 28); and when I do I get the breakouts; anxiety; moodiness. The pill was supposed to help; but I'm feeling upset all the time. I just want to be a regular woman and it's not fair. Nothing is working in life but I at least felt like I was attractive and knowing how ovulation is a big part of that... it makes me feel like I'm going through menopause to not have this. I really feel like I'll commit suicide if it gets much worse; if I go in next month and get tests ran that come out badly. I was just in shock in my initial appt. with the ob-gyn because my ultrasound came in mail marked ""satisfactory."" Now to hear that I could have PCOS and just having to wait until I go off this terrible pill (which I will next month becuase I can't STAND synthetic hormones in my body) to see if my cycles will regulate or get even more messed up. Please tell me that this isn't just going to get worse. I can deal with missing two cycles in a row; but to miss more than that. I might as well not be alive because it's an unreal thing to have to go through at 28 years old. :("	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I cook very healthy (bake or broil) for both my husband & myself. I have cooked healthy since we found out my grandpa had many many things wrong with him (diabetes; gout; high blood pressure; stomach issues; you name it-he had it) because my grandma cooked Hungarian style. For the past month (since approx 03/20/09) I have had stomach issues: nausea/vomiting; very soft stool/diarhea; migraines; extremely severe lower abdominal pain; extremely severe gas. (The gas & soft stool has been extremely toxic) which I have never experienced before until the past month. I waited to go to a gastrologist because I didn't have the money for the copay. I was just informed that urine & stool came out normal. If everything is normal; then what is wrong with me. All of this very painful. EVERYTHING I eat goes through me anywhwere from 20 minutes to 1 hr. I can't go anywhere or do anything except sit on the toilet & throw up with a small trashcan on my lap. When I have errands to run; groceries; etc I can't eat until I come home and being diabetic isn't good for me not to eat something. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. This is beginning to get me real depressed and I'm not a depressing person. I try to keep my spirits up. This is worse than my chemo treatments last year. MCV in Richmond; VA called it a liquid chemo for HEPC. I was on a 48 week Interferon & Ribiviron (spelling?) treatment. I am 98% cured. I contracted HEPC in the late 1970's from a required emergency blood transfusion. It laid dormant for over 30 years and the doctors said the diabetes probably brought it out. Red count cells went down to 8.2 at one time. Everything else seems normal; excellent heart; EKG; etc. BUT now I have this extremely severe and very painful stomach issue. Please help me try to figure out what this could be. I am scheduled for an Endoscopy & Colonoscopy on April 30th. My husband's insurance ***** and medical costs and copays are too expensive for us; since he is the only one working right now. INSURANCE INCREASES IN JUNE 2009. Just today I experienced a slither of stool. I don't usually look at my poop; but did today. It was the color of orange; like a neon orange; with a slight hint of yellow. I have to be very discriptive in order to help you figure out what is wrong with me. My apologies. Please help as soon as you can. Thank you so much!	2009	2009	57	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Are using the HCG Injections connected to hair loss? I finished a 2 month round of injections in June during which time I lost 15 pounds. However; during the past months (Sept/Oct) I noticed that I am having substantial hair loss. Every morning I brush out lots of hair and the texture of my hair has changed. I have stopped shampooing every day and just water rinse my hair every other day; but the hair loss continues. Has anyone had hair loss after going off HCG? If so; does the body begin to adjust and new hair grow back or is the hair gone forever? This is really a bad side effect if it is related to using HCG. HELP does anyone have any experience or recommendation on this. The only other factor that has changed in the past three months is that my Doctor started me on 1000 MG daily of Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes. Could this have caused the change in hair? Or could it be the combination? HELP; who wants to be slim--but bald? I would love to hear from all of you! Thanks. Lucy	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	2 nights ago while working my right lower leg; on the outside part started swelling along with my whole foot. I have had no injuries. I do smoke; I take lisinopril for blood pressure; I take metformin for type 2 diabetes along with Lovasa and Niacin for triglycerides. I have been diagnosed with CAD. I went home thinking I had just had too much salt or sat wrong or something. The sweeling was down a little in the morning but I had a dull ache on the outside of my shin bone in that muscle. Went to work that night and the swelling came back to the point I had to take my shoe off; the swelling was pretty bad; the skin looked like it had been polished it was so shiny. Boss offered to let me go home but it didn't hurt so I stayed. I sit when I'm at work so didn't think I could do much damage while sitting. Went home the next morning the swelling was down again but the muscle seemed like it was bulging or swollen on the outerside next to the shin bone. I'm at work again and the swelling is coming back and there is an achy feeling in the outside lower half of my leg. My co worker says I should go to ER because it sounds like a blood clot; but I dont' know anything about that and not sure if this is a good reason for an ER visit. What do you think?	2009	2011

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed type 2 at 34. I was gestational with both my pregnancies too. I was never able to diet control. At the time I was diagnosed I was working out an hour a day; was very active working on the farm and was eating a fairly good diet. In response to my diagnosis; I lost 20 lbs and cut out fruit juice and some of the grains in my diet. This worked for all these years. I developed some health problem over the last couple of years and noticed my FBS went from being about 110 to being more like 125.My 2 hour PP readings were still under 165 until the last 6 months or so. After working with various drs. we figured out that my exhaustion was coming from anemia; my thyroid is doing something abnormal but they aren't sure what. I have been on synthroid since I was 12 and am currently not on any because my levels seem to have stabilized somewhat. My anemia stemmed from female issues which resulted in a hysterectomy a couple months ago. So now that I'm feeling somewhat better I wanted to tackle the elevated BS problem. I was hoping that they hysterectomy would take care of it (when you feel awful your BS tends to be high). No such luck. If anything; my BS is higher than before surgery (I still have ovaries but there seems to have been a reduction in estrogen; not that it's gone but I think I had too much before). So today; I decided that I would not eat carbs except for what was in meat and veggies. I haven't even had any fruit although I did have a 1/4 cup of 1% milk in my morning coffee. My readings today are not so hot. FSB 129. 2 hr pp 152. 3 hr pp 110. Pre lunch 111. About 1.25 hr after lunch 157. My breakfast contained 4 carbs. My lunch contained 11. It seems my after meal jump shouldn't be happening. I know to many; 11 is a lot of carbs but all I ate was some lean ham stir fried with about 2 cups of assorted non starchy veggies. I currently take 500 mg Metformin after breakfast; after lunch; and before bed. My FSB has been high but a couple days ago I read something on another board that said try adding a higher fat snack like cheese or peanut butter shortly before bedtime to prevent your liver from dumping glucose in the early morning. Since high FSB has always been a problem I thought I would try it. It seems to be helping; just not enough. Do I just need to persist on this really low carb diet to try to flush out extra carbs or is it just time for an increase in my Met? I don't know that I can learn to eat like this. I have watched my carbs for years but always have included things like a slice of whole wheat bread; noodles; potatoes and a little rice. And yeah; that periodic cookie or piece of candy.	2012	2012	46	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am very much wanting some sort of medical advice... I had an abnormal pelvic exam Thurs. (pain on Right side with palpation) during exam & was sent for pelvic & TV U/S. The results show: 2.1 x 1.9 x 2.4cm complex cystic lesion IN right ovary with thick septations with a focal echogenic area. No abnormal fluid around R ovary. Ovary measuring 4 x 2.6 x 4cm. Left ovary showed ""multiple"" follicular cysts. We did not even think we were finished having children & this is very heart-wrenching; thinking I could be infertile. Also; to think this R ovary could possibly be cancerous????? The impression stated that the differential diagnosis includes dermoid cyst; cystadenoma; or even cystadenocarcinoma. Radiologist also recomm. laparoscopy. Sounds like I am going to lose my ovaries? or can they take a cyst from INSIDE the overy without damaging it? Is this possibly life-threatening or in need of chemo? Very worried. We just moved & have no family here & 5 & 7 yr. olds to care for. Anxiously awaiting some sort of info. P.S. Brand new OB for me as we just moved here 4 mos. ago & she never even called me back when I paged her yesterday afternoon. Info? Please...thank you"	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Brand new to site and new to detailed Thyroid info. labs out of range/ratio. Very confused. Help please! History: diagnosed LADA (T1 diabetes) 3 years ago. On insulin and metformin. Started thyroid meds about same time. Currently on Tirosint 88 and have been on this amt for over 1 yr. Recent past FT3 labs (two separate testings over the last month or so) came back: 2.2 L (Range 2.3-4.2) with TSH .875 (Range: .350-5.500) Dr. prescribed 5 cytomel without much more info. Started some reading re thyroid. Did not start cytomel as I wanted additional testing. So... Redid FT3 test again with additional tests last week. These most recent labs came back as follows: TSH: 0.337 L (Range .350-5.500) FT4: 1.65 (Range: .89-1.76) FT3: 2.4 (Range: 2.3-4.2) Anti-TG <20 (Range <41) TPO 33 (Range <61) Thyroglobulin (TG) 2.4 (Range: <55) RT3: 443 H (Range: 90-350) Iron Serum: 67 (Range:30-170) TIBC: 284 (Range: 250-450) Ferritin: 48 (Range: 10-291) Vit B12: 1219 H (Range: 211-911) Vit D 25: 50.5 (Range: 30-100) What does all this mean--the very high RT3 and Vit B!2; especially? My Dr. keeps saying I have Hashi's; but do the labs indicate this? interpretation and some direction would be so appreciated!! Thank you!	2015	2015		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I recently got my blood tests back and am not sure if I have ""Heart Disease"" in the classical meaning of the phrase or just a bad reading or ""Bad Numbers"" which need to be addressed. Can someone please clarify this for me? First off; I'm a recently turned 60 year old man who used to be an athletic type during my younger years and over the years let it all go down the drain it seems. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 almost exactly 2 years ago; and also hypertension for the first time. Although my Hypertension was on the low side then the Dr. Still prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg a day for me which I have taken until recently (he upped it my last visit to 40 mg a day predicated on my own readings showing that 20 mg was not enough (he said that even if there was some disparity that 40 mg a day ""wouldn't hurt me' or lower my blood pressure any further and it was ok-and even said I could break the tablets in half after 20 mg and take 10 followed with 10 later if my blood pressure went up again. At that time; 2 years ago he also prescribed 500 Mg of Metformin to be taken twice daily which I have followed to the letter since then; plus 40 mg of Simvastatin or Zocor once a day. I cut the Simvastatin out back in December after having experienced the worst vertigo episode one could imagine-cat scan Dr. ordered at the ER showed no problem like stroke-but the reoccurrence of the vertigo and he prescribed it to probably an inner ear infection or something in that nature. I was prescribed Meclizine for the vertigo if it came back again; which it did (he called it positional vertigo as one position stopped the terrible spinning of the world around me-and the med with some valium did the job..until the next and then the next episode days apart. Then I got on the internet and saw all the horror stories and similar symptoms that Simvastatin caused and stopped taking immediately-Dr. or no Dr’s advice. The vertigo disappeared the next day until 4 months later where I’m back in the ER again and again CAT scan showed ok-but ER Dr. said I did a good thing by eliminating the Simvastatin; citing other problems it could cause besides vertigo down the road. So I took Simvastatin for only 1 ½ years-until the symptoms showed up. My Dr. who is a heart specialist and has been around for a long time was given the ER results and after putting off my visit to him for a long time (ok I don’t like going to the doctor!) realized I needed blood tests done as I was feeling; and still am feeling; absolutely miserable. The results are as follows-just under 2 weeks ago-total cholesterol 199-not bad as it has been worse in the past..but he said my “now” cholesterol reading was not good-somewhere around 274 or 279-my HDL is 25 (has always been bad and fluctuated over the years-highest 38 and never reached that 40 number in this decade); Triglycerides 505 (was over 700 2 years before; got it down with walking and exercise and a fish oil prescription called Lovazo to 180-then back to my unhealthy ways-lot of stress-death in the family and so on-did not help as I have stayed home and secluded for 10 months now-and probably why my vitamin D count according to the Dr. is very very low at 11.6) VLDL is 101; Dr. guesstimates my LDL is around the 140 area due to improper calculation because of high triglycerides; Glucose serum is 116 but the Dr. said because my A1c is 5.4 that’s good as the Metformin is working as it should be. The Dr. made the following changes in my prescription-he finally gave in to my saying that I would NOT take impastation again and prescribed Niaspan 500-wants me to take twice daily if the (“side affects“) improve (improve? “Fahget bout it!”) in a week or so. I read what the side effects are on Niaspan and they are not good at all and I don’t need to go through all that now. He was about to add a new statin to that until he realized that he was giving me too much all at once-as he said later. New Statin down the road (A big Maybe on that one)? I am going to do exactly what I did the last time 2 years ago-sans the impastation-take fish oil omega 3 over the counter-the Dr. said that was ok as long as it did not exceed 4 grams per day-similar to Lovazo-walk and walk and walk; which I did the last time and my lipid results improved dramatically going from about 220 total cholesterol to 167 and my triglycerides dropping from a whopping over 700 to 180 and my HDL going from 27 to 34-some improvement anyway-all in 6 weeks. Then I will tell him I didn’t take the Niaspan (which I believe he suspects I will not take anyway); and after the blood tests see where I am. During the 2 years I had a cat scan done to check on a suspected nodular opacity which was not there as shown incorrectly on the exray (with contrast and one reason I don’t need to go through that horrible toasted sensation all over my body which Niaspan causes plus other side affects). I know this was a long story but since I have not spoken about this and seen the Dr. very rarely in the past 2 years I felt I needed to tell all to the experts on here or people that I consider experts with their vast experience judging from the posts as compared to my limited experience. I’m 5’9 and approx 224 lbs. by the way-and that’s the first thing that is going to go-if I don’t get a heart attack first! Seriously though; wondering if I have “Heart Disease” in the classical meaning of the word (Never asked my Dr. and he’s a bit evasive on such direct questions anyway). Anybody care to help please let me know what you think. I am contributing my 199 total cholesterol to eating a lot healthier these past several months but don’t know what that “now cholesterol” that the Dr. talked about is-as that seemed to be of some concern to him. One last thing-my Dr. made me feel great before I left his office when I asked him what my chances of getting a heart attack were now and he should me this rectangular plastic thing where I saw little lego miniature type blocks-very little and then this block as big as the Washington Monument next to them (that’s me he said insofar as my chances of getting a heart attack) and a slightly taller lego type next to that. Boy I needed that! He did say-”Keep walking” as I was leaving his office which was encouraging of course."	2010	2010	59	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	So I failed my 1 hour glucose test with a 217! I'm really wondering if it had something to do with what I ate this weekend. I had an abnormally high amount of carbs (biscuits; breads; etc.) and sugar (sherbert; donuts). I was out of town and being cooked for so I wasn't able to watch what went in things. I am on metformin 1000 milligrams ER. I go back next week for the 3 hour test. What are my chances of passing with a low carb and high protein diet with a number that high? Is there anything else I can do to avoid failing?	2008	2011	27	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just got the results of my Nuclear Stress Test conducted chemically at the VA Hosp in Charleston; SC. I was looking forward to maybe finding out why my pulse rate has always been so high; especially in the last few years. The night before the test I measured 120 while rested and at rest using an automatic blood pressure checker. I just got the letter with results and it is Greek to me. It says my Nuclear Stress test was normal; Myocardial perfusion scan with no evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. The left wall motion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated to be 54%.... Two questions. How does 54% rate for a man 70 years old with emphysema. Also; I wad determined to try and find out why my pulse is so high and what can be done about it; if anything. Furthermore; I secretly hoped maybe I needed a valve or stint or something that might be impairing blood flow. If nothing is 'fixable' with my circulatory system I am stuck with it all being my lungs which are less apt to ever get any improvement. aI am overweight mostly from having no energy or breath needed to exercise. Just shopping without an electric cart is almost beyond reach. I also have minor diabetes and using Meformin 500 mg; no shots; and do not take any type of meds with narcotics of any kind that would elevate my pulse.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"About 8 weeks ago my husband (71) developed movement on the right side of his body; especially with the right hand and fingers. Some twiching also developed in his right leg and shoulder. This ""chorea"" movement is fluid and ceases when he is asleep. He was also diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol. At the time he weighed 285 (5'11""). Our family physician prescribed Metformin and Pravastatin. Blood sugar levels (previously over 300) and blood pressure have come down to low levels. His neurologist suggested a Huntington's Disease test but the test came back negative. The neurologist prescribed Haldol to help with the tremors. The neurologist ordered a brain MRI which revealed a spot in the basal ganglia; however; without knowing if this spot happened recently or several years ago (my husband has never been to a doctor; always been healthy until now); the neurologist is not sure what my husband has. He suggested another MRI in about 3 months. My husband weighs 220 pounds now. His twitching has increased; along with other symptoms: anxiety; crushing depression; inability to concentrate on reading newspapers and following TV programs. He also has lost his ability to taste food. He even has lost his interest in following sports (his favorite pass time). Can someone help me help the doctors?"	2008	2008	54	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have two things going on: 1. I have a small (dime-size) lump on the right side of my neck. It is even with my ear near the base of my neck. I have had it for approx. 3 years. It is definitely someone in my neck vs. related to my skin as my skin appears normal. It doesn't hurt and it doesn't move. In fact it doesn't bother me at all and I've never really been concerned about it until a friend urged me to get it checked out. 2. My right thigh - depending on how I walk; how I sit; etc. - has a burning pain periodically. I also experience numbness - all localized on the outside of my right thigh. I am overweight; so am not sure if that is a cause - but there is no numbness in my feet or hands; or even my arms or left thigh - it is very much right thigh specific. I'll also throw out there that I've been a little tired lately. And had some aching all over - almost like ""growing pains"" when I was a kid - the same kind of sudden pain somewhere that goes as fast as it comes. Mostly in my limbs. So I'm not sure what this could be... well; I have some not very positive thoughts that are driving me crazy right now. So any thoughts on that it might be; tests to request from my doctor (I have an appt next week); anything to calm me down from obsessing all weekend or preparing me for what I might have to deal with next week would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 31 yr old female. I have Type 2 diabetes and high cholest. I take Metformin and Simvastatin (sp?). I am about 10 lbs overweight. This last pat week I have been having tightening of the chest. I know this sounds funny but it feels like you are watching a movie and you are trying to hold back crying :-) LOL Like pressure in the chest. But it is also accompanied by; I feel sick to my stomach and don't want to eat or drink; really tired all the time even after waking in the AM from sleeping all night. Also feeling short of breath this week = like I am paying more attention to breathing and I have to make an effort to breath deep to get enough air in my lungs. I am on the verge of tears and have a lot of stress in my life right now with my marriage and financial issues. So I know this sounds funny - but I don't want to go to the docs and them tell me it is gas or something and have to pay a copay and look like an idiot..... So should I worry or give it a few days???

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Reading the ClinicCare article on Steatosis found this interesting.... weighing more than 85 kg who were treated with 270 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a were found to have higher serum trough concentrations of the drug and a higher overall SVR rate.[56;57] Further investigation is under way to assess the efficacy of higher fixed doses of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in obese patients. Wondering if us chubbs have doctors aware of this... ...Finally; obesity can contribute to fibrosis progression by impairing response to interferon-based therapy. This may occur in part because obesity reduces the bioavailability of interferon. Conventional and peginterferons are injected subcutaneously and preferentially taken up by the lymphatic system. Patients with large amounts of subcutaneous fat may have impaired absorption of the drug because of decreased lymphatic uptake.[55] Although the 2 available types of peginterferon alfa are dosed differently (peginterferon alfa-2a is administered at a fixed dose of 180 μg; whereas peginterferon alfa-2b is dosed at 1.5 μg per kilogram of body weight); the maximum recommended weekly doses are 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a and 150 μg of peginterferon alfa-2b. Patients weighing more than 100 kg may therefore receive a suboptimal dose of peginterferon alfa-2b if dosed according to guidelines. Recent data suggest that 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a may also be insufficient for heavier patients.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Dr. Lupo; Thank you for your response and assistance. I greatly appreciate it. I am scheduled for another recheck for the TSH in May. I will also ask for a retest for the T4. However; my T3 level was never tested. When I requested; my Dr. said something to the effect that the T3 doesn't matter. I did receive a call from the Dr.'s office today telling me that my second set of antibodies test shows I have Hoshimoto's Disease and I have another appointment on Friday to discuss options with my Dr. I'm still wondering if a ultrasound shows no nodule's is there a need for a thyroid scan? and if it's dangerous to the thyroid to have the iodine or radiation medicine injected? Hoping you can respond before I go to the Dr.'s on Friday. Thank You for taking the time and reviewing and answering my postings.	2012	2012	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Why would a doctor not give me a straight up answer about ACTOS? 2nd question: Why would someone who has blood sugar readings of anywhere from 98 to 126 be put on Metformin prior this ACTOS? Is it normal to be much worse off after starting any medication? I used to have such wonderful control upon my own and taking my walks before starting all this ""treatment."" I am so confused that when I ask my physician whether or not ACTOS causes weight gain; she answered; ""No; it does not. It causes weight loss!"" Jiminy crickets! And all over the net various patients are complaining about rapid weight gain. The worst report was a lady who had lost a LOT of weight like I have; and she gained 45 pounds within 3 months when placed on ACTOS. I also had the precursor to diabetes type II (PCOD) and I cannot afford to gain weight. I have lost a whole person off my body and it took me 12 years!!!! I already take Metformin; and am still dealing with the fallout from taking it (slight kidney difficulties--kidney stones; diarrhea; nausea. I have been on Metformin alone for 2 years. As soon as I read these instances of side ACTOS side effects; I was so frustrated and disheartened; that I cannot get a straight and honest answer from someone who is supposed to have my BEST interests at heart. I gain weight at the drop of a hat. I still have about 40 more pounds to go. I cannot afford such setbacks. The only reason my blood sugars arose to 140 was because I control it with exercise; and it is HOT here in Texas. The treadmill isn't the same as propelling my full body weight down a path in the park!!!!! I am AFRAID now to take ACTOS--more so because I don't believe that I was given an honest answer. THe hot weather cannot last forever; and my walks really truly control the sugar when I am able to do them. Even the pharmacist said that it causes swelling (edema). Not to mention I have mitral valve heart damage; and the kidney stone thing going on; and from what I was reading from the pharmaceutical company; it was not recommended that people with heart trouble and kidney trouble take ACTOS. So you can see my frustration and fear?"	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"For several months I've been having a general ill feeling. Within the last 2 months it's gone from just feeling tired after a full night sleep to dizziness; fatigue; and nausea spells that come out of nowhere every day (my blood sugar is good; so it's not that). In February I started seeing a new doctor who decided to do a CBC just to check everything because my PCOS was ""flaring up"" again and causing unexplained bleeding. What came back was a WBC count of 17.1 and my HCT was low; I now have a vitamin D deficiency (which isn't rare; but it's annoying). I also had a very high blood pressure for the first time in my life; despite being overweight my blood pressure is usually normal. She decided to send me to a Hematologist who ran some tests but due to health insurance I wasn't able to follow up right away. Two weeks ago I finally followed up with my hematologist and he ran more tests and suggest that I get a bone marrow biopsy. I'm scheduled to get it done this Friday; but I'm wondering what he may be testing for? He wasn't very specific. A few of my recent test results came back either below or above average; and that may give an idea of what's going on; but I'm having a hard time understanding what it all may mean. I've been doing the one thing I shouldn't - reading everything online. A lot of what I read points to an autoimmune disease or something; so I'm just trying to get a few opinions. These are the test results that came back ""weird"": WBC 14.5 HCT 35.5 NU#(ANC) 10.1 Iron; % saturation 10.4 Reticulocyte count 2.0 Alpha-1 blobulin 0.5 Beta globulin 1.4 ESR 61 Maybe I'm just overreacting; but any opinions would be appreciated."	2014	2014	24	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am diabetic since 1998; at the time I discovered that I am diabetic the blood level was 450 mg/dl and ketone bodies were +4 out of 5. I managed to lower it within one week with tablets to 130 mg/dl and adopting 0 carb intake; I was obese (160 kg); I lost weight and brought my weight down to 95 kg within 6 months by diet only the famous 0 carb diet and got my hypertension from 160/110 to 110/70 (mm Hg). I kept measuring Fbg and Blood pressure and always found them at 75 mg/dl for fbg and 110/70 for blood tension. till I was conveinced that my pancreas was regenerated and I returned cautiously to normal food and I gained weight. Last year I experienced polyurea and I consulted my Doctor who thought that it is related to my prostate since I am already 58 yrs. I checked my urine sugar before 6 weeks and found 3% sugar excreted in urine ( according to Roche TM urine sugar test stripes. and my FBG 330 mg/dl. my blood pressure 160/110 mg/dl I went to my Doctor and gave me glucophage and I returned to my previous diet and I have a 0 urine sugar level blood pressure 140 /93 mmHg . but my Fbg becomes highest in the morning and lowest at bed time 260 FBG morning and 180 mg/dl at bed time.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I guess I should start by saying I am new here..and I have this dilemna. I feel like **** all the time. Dry; patchy scaly skin; headaches; I dont sleep very well; I am tired all the time not near the energy I had before the surgery. I have almost lost all of my sex drive. I get hot then cold; and it seems like I am forgetting things...even at my job..and that cannot happen. I got my T4 free results: 1.4 TSH 0.434. Dr. says normal. the numbers are normal....but why am I gaining weight (20 pounds). It seems like daily. And why do I feel the way I feel if everything is normal? I have had a hysterectomy 17 yrs ago; that would explain some bloating maybe; and all the weight I gain is right in the middle of my belly...I am starting to look 5 months preggers....This is so NOT fun. Being that I had my thyroid removed 8 months ago; I am currently on Levothyroxine (0.125 mg). I also have type 2 diabetes; insulin dependent. I take 35 units of Lantus at night. I take Novolog on a sliding scale using 2 units per carb. My blood sugars are in control. I take Lisinopril 40mg. I take Amlodipine 5 mg. I have gained weight and cannot lose any. It is as if I have a tube in my belly pumping air in. I do treadmill ; ablounge and pilates 4 days a week. I have even changed the way I eat because of this weight issue.	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Well…I got my 4 week PCR results back today and I only got a one log drop from 848;000 to 38;600. To be honest; I thought RVR was a long shot considering my stats going in; but with the amped up doses; I really thought I’d see more of a drop. So now instead of decreasing the Pegasys down to 1 ½ doses a week; I am to stay at the full 360 mcg a week and stay at 1400 Riba until the 12 week mark and then extend SOC to 72 weeks. I’m almost too disheartened to cry right now; but I’m sure the tears will come at some point. I still wonder if I am getting enough…what do you call it? Saturation? with the Riba even at 1400 mg since my hgb is hard pressed to budge downward. But the thought of upping it to 1600 makes me almost physically ill; not that it’s been recommended. So what do you do? Cuss and cry it out for a day then start putting one foot in front of the other again. I mean; what else can you do? I want to clear; but I don’t want to nuke myself in the doing…… So I’ll give myself another jab tonite and hopefully kill off a few more of those buggers; Any suggestions of anything more I could try; even if it's outside the norm?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in June 2008. During the year prior to the diagnosis; I went from a weight of 115-118 lbs to 140-145 lbs. During that time; I was also diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency and started on shots. My initial TSH result was 55.54 in June 2008 and I was put on 100 mcg synthroid daily. In mid Sep 2008; my TSH was again tested and result was 0.03 and my synthroid was dropped to 88 mcg daily. For well over a year; I have been on a diet (approx 1000-1200 calories/day) focusing on vegetables; fruits and whole grains. I work out for at least 30 minutes/day; as well as having a job which requires a large amount of exercise (mostly walking). In spite of my diet and exercise; my weight had stayed right around 145; but recently has begun to creep up again - it's now 149. I have talked to my doctor; but have not been given any ideas as to what might still be the problem. Is there something else that we should be looking for that could be causing this? Can you give some ideas of things that might help me lose the excess weight. Since I've never carried this much weight before; it's beginning to affect my feet and knees.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; Diagnosed with variable blood pressure. If I take my BP while seated or reclined - after relaxing; it is always hypotension (ie 68/40; 56/38)It gets even lower at night. If I've just walked in to do so; without relaxing first it always quite high (ie 168/135; 172/139) and takes a long while to come down. Given HCTZ (25mgs) for hypertension. Unable to tolerate Ace Inhibitor (Altace) and Beta Blocker (Inderal). (I take thyroid replacement hormone for hypothyroid and Inderal blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 hormone. The Altace raised creatinine levels). Being hypothyroid I really have to be vigilent about exercise; or the weight piles on. But; I'm really nervous about exercising now that I have this wonky BP. I always thought with hypertension a person's BP was up ALL the time. Are these kinds of WILD swings; common? Should I be limiting activity? I really don't have to do a lot to really raise it from hypotension to hypertension-just walk across the room - so what will exercise do to it? What causes such wide swings? I've struggled to finally get the hypothyroid meds optimized and within range; and I feel pretty good. Now I find out I have this weird BP thing too. What hypertension meds will not interfer with thyroid meds? Would you recommend a stronger diuretic (furosimide)? Does furosimide interfer with thyroid hormone replacement? Is there a hypertension med you'd recommend? Can thyroid CAUSE this variable BP problem? Can thyroid meds cause it? Should I be as scared as I am that my BP is all over the map? Thanks so much! little0ne	2002	2002		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have type 2 diabetes; and take metformin; gabapentin; and simvastatin How often should i be testing my blood glucose? This discussion is related to upper leg pain and lower back pain.	2009	2009		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Yesterday I spent several hours; running errands. I stopped for a hamburger and diet drink while on the go. When I got home about 2 hours later; I had an upset stomach; body aches; and flushed cheeks. I felt sick and thought I had a fever. But; when I took my temp. it was only 91.4; using a digital thermometer under the tongue. (My temp. usually runs around 96.8.) I took 2 Tums and 2Acetaminophen (550 mg each). About an hour later my temp went up to 94.2; then dropped back down to 92.8 later. I have Type 2 diabetes (and for got to take my metformin in the morning). I had a vaccine shot for hepatitis years ago. This has happened before but not often; and not this extreme. My DR. recently did a thyroid check which came back in the low normal range. What could be causing this??	2014	2014	68	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a Bipolar 2 person with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes and am on tons of meds including lamictal; wellbutrin; concerta; altace & metformin. Recently I have experienced heart palpitations on an increasing frequency. First it started when I began taking my 2nd 18mg concerta (I take 2 18mg daily). I had palps maybe once or twice a week for 1-2 hours around the same time every day (3-5 hours after taking morning meds). This past week I began to experience it everyday 3-4 hours after morning meds; lasting from 1-3 hours. Finally; I had a day where I was really tired and didn't feel well and the palps started at my usual time and lasted 9 hours. I went to the hospital where they did ECGs; xray and a multitude of blood work. The palps showed on the ECG as well as on the monitors; my blood pressure was around 150/105. Then they suddenly stopped and my blood pressure went down. The doctor said they could ind nothing heart related wrong and I was told I had premature ventricular fibrillations; which are not uncommon or serious. However; they are EXTREMELY uncomfortable and cause shortness of breath and are not going away. I am on a Holter monitor for 24 hours and my doctor prescribed 25mg of atenolol to help stop the palpitations. I feel as if my medications may be the root of the problem; specifically the Concerta. Does it take time for meds to build up in your system and can cause the irregular heart beat problem? I would rather go off concerta than add yet another drug to the mix. Any thoughts on this? The palpitations are becoming a big problem for me.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Okay; first off I know that no one here can actually DX me and that is okay. I'm just looking for support I guess. With that being said; I am a 26yo male in a good health for the most part. I am overweight and have had blood test done cause I was feeling very shakey and always tired and the blood tests showed I have insulin resistance so the Dr gave me Metformin XR to take to help with that while i lose some weight. I'm not diebetic...YET and hopefully I won't get there. Anyway. this whole thing started about a few months ago. I noticed both of my legs felt a little odd and my arms did too; they felt like they were weak but when I would stand on them and use them they didnt seem weak at all but they did tremble a little bit when i would use them but never had any problems lifting or anything like that; yet i still felt like something was wrong with me. I just felt very fatigued overall and slept a lot. This feeling lasted for about a month and then went away completely just as my Mother and I went on vacation. I was thinking it might be stress cause my home life is VERY stressful. I'm worried about my future and my life ingeneral and how I'll get by; normal worries i guess everyone has; but i've always taken things way worse than most people. I tend to dwell on things. So; I was gone on vacation for about a week down south and I had no problems at all. NOTHING. Then shortly after I got back I started to get these little twitches in my arms and legs but its mostly on my left side. They're very minor but i can feel them and they last a few second then go away for hours or even a day or two then come back for a little bit. They seem to go away when i use my muscles and walk around or use my arms. But; if I sit down or lay down for a bit they MAY come back; not always. Then about 2 weeks of it; it all went away again then one week later I started to feel the twitching again. It's still on my left side. My arm and leg. the twitching in my leg is always these 2 spots. One in the back of my caff and the other on the side of my thigh. The twitching in my arm is random but isnt there so much as my leg. And of course the tiredness and wanting to sleep it back but its not every day i feel tired. Lately I've noticed other places in my body twitching like my buttox and my left hip side. Weird huh? Every since this started I've been googling the symptoms over and over and driving myself totally insane. I've read up about all the symptoms of MS and I only have 2 of the huge list of symptoms that are normally associated with MS. I've never any vision problems; no falling no loss of balance ever. No family history of MS. No pain; no sensitiveity to heat... nothing but the randomly twitching muscles and being tired off and on. I wonder if maybe this is all stress anxity and depression and the worrying is just caused by my brain which makes the symptoms worse. My mother is a R.N. and says that it is all in my head and that I'm acting nuts. This worrying about my health has destroyed my social life. I use to be the person who would always wanna go out and have fun and I did go 2 a week but that has stopped completely. I dont' feel like going out; i dont even feel like answering the phone when my friend call and they're pretty much stopped calling me now and moved on. I don't feel like even leaving my room sometimes. I'll just stay on my computer and my games and talk to a couple online friends and that's pretty much my life right now. I don't feel like doing anything unless I feel 100% good; if there is even ONe tiny little thing i feel then i dwell on it and it ruins my whole day. I really need help and answers. Does this sound like something or is it just normal and my brain is making me think it's abnormal. Thank you... Ever since this started ive bee	2009	2009	25	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	About four weeks ago my wife suffered a stroke when she was taken off life support. I believe it was to the left side of the brain because her right leg and arm were totally dead; she couldn't feel them at all. Even when a doctor put a pin to her foot there was no reaction at all. Her speech was a mess and the right side of her face dropped. She is 38 years old. After being at home for two weeks I have been trying my best to get her as back to normal as possible but to be honest I'm going nuts because I don't really know what therapy to use. So far I have managed to get her walking with a frame and her right leg is able to support her weight with a bit of a wobble. Her foot is ticklish now. Her right arm is moving but much weaker than the left one. She is able to do knitting; but there isn't enough strength in her fingers to cut her food with a knife. Her speech is totally back to normal and her face is symetrical again with no droop at all. Is this good progress over a two week period or should there be much more improvement? Doctors have told me that once the deadline of one year is reached; that's it; there's no more improvement. Is that true? I find it hard to believe. I would really appreciate some ideas on the type of exercises I should encourage her to do for building up her strength. I think the feeling is all there; it's just the weakness now. She can move each finger individually and co-ordinate her arm/hand to grab objects. She just seems confused as to how hard to grasp them. Any help is appreciated.	2009	2009	47	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I need some expert advise on my father's health. He was perfectly alright until October 2010 until he was hospitalized. I need your expert advise for that. He was hospitalized for a week and he was under cardiac surviellance for a week under which he went through ECG; Echocardiogram; Angiogram; and Stress Thallium Test (after 15 days of discharge from Hospital). His stress thallium states as follows: Patient is a case of CAD; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes mellitus with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Recent CAG shows 70% mid and distal LAD stenosis; 50%om2; and 60-70% RCA lesion. Stress MPI scan is being done to evaluate for reversible ischaemia. The LV cavity appears dilated at both stress and rest. Stress SPECT images reofmrate din the short and long axes shows an area of moderate perfusion defect invoving the Apex; apicoseptal and apicoanterior segments and inferior wall of the LV myocardium which shows mild reperfusion in the resting images. Tracer distribution in rest of the left ventricular myocardium is within normal physiological limits at both stress and rest. Quantification using the emory cardiac toolbox shows evidence of reversible ischameia involving the LAD and RCA territories. Note: The extent of ischemia in severe triple vessle disease may be underestimated due to balanced hypoperfusion. Functional information: Multi gated rest SPECT images show global hypokinesia of the LV myocardium with reduced systolic wall thickening with overall reduced resting left ventricular systolic function. LVEF 15+/-5%. IMPRESSION: Scan evidence of mild stress induced reversible ischaemia involving the apex; apicoseptal and apicoanterior segments and inferior wall of the LV myocardium. Reduced resting systolic LV function with RWMA as described as estimated by quantitative GATED SPECT. Please correlate clinically. Above the report of Stress Thallium test. Kindly suggest what to do. We took several opinions from several doctors; some says he should go for stenting; some says nothing can help him. We dont believe as heart can get deprived so fast without the patient knowing or feeling any indications before. Please suggest what to do. He is taking following medicines. I m giving you generic name: 1. furosemide (trade name in India is Lasix) 20 mg b.i.d. 2. spironolactone (trade name Aldactone) 25 mg o.d. 3. remipril (Trade name Cardace) 10 mg o.d. 4.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	What are the reasons for vit B12 deficiency. What are long term repercussions of such. What is the remedy	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with diabetes with high blood sugar levels around 3 months ago. I changed my diet; started medication; and started doing walks as per doctor's advice. My blood sugar levels came to normal with all these changes; which took around 3 weeks. After that suddenly I got severe pain in my feets. I had to take rest for 2 to 3 days when the pain cooled down and I could walk again. But anytime I walked little faster or little longer the pain would appear again and I had to take rest for couple of days. This went on and off for about 2 weeks and then I thought I should take rest for 2 to 3 weeks. I took rest and the pain cooled down buy still Iwas having pains in different parts of the feet even during rest. This has been now around 2.5 months and I still have mild pain that move around at different places of feet and sometime lower leg. Meantime I have consulted orthopedic doctors; nurologist; rheumatologist and vascular surgeon with basic tests done like x ray; mri; blood tests and ultrasound doppler test. All these tests are more or less normal as per doctors and do not explain the problem.I still continue to suffer from mild pain in my feets and occasionally lower legs; which increases with after doing short walks and cools down in rest but still happen doing rest. After daylong of short walks and standings the pain is more at night and I have to take pain killer and one medicine suggestefd by neurologist (pregab 75) to sleep.What can be the cause of this pain?	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm a 61-yr-old male with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed about 2000--and being treated with Glipizide; Metformin and Byetta. After managing to get results of standard test battery ordered by endo in late January (TSH=4.89 with .40--4.0 ""normal"" range; T-4--can't recall but it was ""normal""); with 2-3 months to go before seeing endo-- and no urgency on his part--I concluded I am hypo. I started reviewing my symptoms--96.5 avg temperature...very high cholesterol...depression...and several more--and was able to get my internist to agree with hypo diagnosis 2 1/2 weeks ago. (He's nice guy; but just not knowledgeable enough to help manage my hypo; esp on top of diabetes; am trying to find a decent; openminded endo. Two possibilities locally; perhaps another 3-4 with 2 hour drive to Raleigh or Durham.) After starting on 50 mcg levothyroxin (manufacturer: Mylan) for two weeks; I was concerned Walmart might change to another non-branded generic at some point; screwing up my therapy. So I got my doc to switch me to Levoxyl late last week. About four days before the switch; I started having abnormally high pre-meal sugars (say; 180--200 before meals) which then dropped quickly in the 2-3 hours after meals to 60--100; when they would normally be 140--160... I've usually been pretty stable---(a1c is usually low 6 range)--though not consistently. But I'm concerned about how dangerous or lasting these sugar changes might be--and their cause. Does anyone know whether thyroid meds are known to play games with blood sugars; and whether this may be a temporary stage in adjusting after just starting these meds.? Personal experience is fine; but would also prefer to know about any research that may have been done on this. Are docs aware of it; and can it or need it be treated? Incidentally; I saw some acronyms that are apparently familiar to many who are long-time hypos; but were Greek to me; if anyone can explain---TPO....tpo ab.... Many thanks; Brian134"	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Thank you for taking my question. I have been reading that PACs and PVCs are benign in the setting of a structurely sound heart. I have CAD and a 5 graft CABG but have had no heart attacks or heart damage. Does that mean that the PACs and PVCs that I have are benign? In other words; is someone who has CAD and no heart damage considered to have a structurely sound heart? Thanks again.	2006	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Sandalwood posted this study in the thread below on long term side effects after tx. I found this to be a real eye opener; in that it really validates the randon percentages of treaters that are reporting the exact same problems we have been discussing here on the forum. Thanks for posting this study; because it is very personal; comprehensive; and jarring! Look at the percentages of the 27 test subjects who report all sorts of issues. Consider how this random group could be extrapolated out into the entire treating community. I find the comments and conclusions in this piece to be the FIRST and ONLY that have honestly and thoroughly looked at this issue. The actual experiences of people after finishing therapy. For those that scoff at the idea of therapy after effects; or think its only a small; insignificant group....READ THIS STUDY. Thanks for finding this study Sandalwood.!!! Its unique. Here is the link. Note especially pages 16-20...and conclusions... http://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/media/File/Recovery_from_hepatitis_C_treatments.pdf I think we have only scratched the surface of the iceberg here on the forum. Who knows what the real long term issues might really involve; and how many are really affected. Like people say in the study...Where ARE the studies? Who did warn any of us of these long term problems? What are the doctors and drug companies doing to find out what is really the status? Read and enjoy....or cry...whatever the case.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm a 60 year old man with type 2 diabetes in fair control with metformin and Lantus; a bit of hypertension; good lipid profiles; good metabolic panels; no manifest symptoms compromising my quality of life...except for bouts of SVT that take me to the ER about every 1-3 months for a hit of adenosine to convert the rhythm. Every time I go to the ER they fuss at me to get an ablation; but frankly; I've just been scared about the (admittedly low) risks...but recently I've had to change medical plans; and the ER coverage just isn't as good as on my previous plans. If I end up in the ER for the adenosine jolt every time I get one of these; under my new plan I could end up paying in the five figures every year just to ""manage"" my SVT. I'm on 100 mg of metoprolol succinate a day; and it still doesn't keep the SVT away. I finally decided to get the ablation; and mine is scheduled for November 21. My EP doc is a guy who's done thousands of these procedures; who has studied with some of the foremost doctors in the field; and who projects every confidence that it's all gonna be fine. And I know the odds are with me. And I'm tired of having to worry about what I'd do if I had an attack of SVT on a plane flying over the ocean; or on a bus while I'm chaperoning a church youth group trip. Most of all; I feel like I can't afford the chronic trips to the ER to convert the rhythm. I used to be able to convert it myself through Valsalva; but it won't convert any more like that...it makes me a little bitter that the rhythm itself isn't dangerous; so in a sense it's an elective treatment for something that can be taken care of by trips to the ER. But the ER treatment is expensive...so it makes you put a price on your life; and apparently my wife and I have come to the decision that my life isn't worth not risking; so that we can save the money we're paying for the chronic trips to the ER. That said; I know the risk is low. And I've seen post after post from people who've had it done for SVT and who say it's the best decision they ever made. And I have confidence in my EP; and he uses anesthetic so I don't worry about any discomfort during the procedure; and he uses cryo for AVNRT and RF for AVRT and says he won't know which it is until he does the mapping; which makes sense...and I'd really love not to have to be troubled any more by this arrhythmia that's plagued me for 46 years. Still...I'm scared. I've set the date; and I'm resigned to it...but I'm scared. Not sure what I think sending this out into the InterWebz will accomplish; maybe I'm just venting. I need to get over myself; I guess."	2016	2016	59	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have type 2 diabetes. My doctor prescribed Byetta and I tried it for several months and the nausea side effects of it was devastating and caused me to gain even more weight. So; when my doctor told me about victoza and its weight loss benefits I was extremely excited about this revolutionary drug that would help lower my blood sugar level; AND LOSE WEIGHT at the same time. In the beginning; Victoza was God sent to me. My apetite decreased and I dropped 15 pounds in about 4-6 months. And I did not experience nausea at any time. Then; all of a sudden the weight loss stopped. My weight loss became stagnated and have been ever since. It has been 2 years since that time and while my blood glucose level and A1C is good; I have gained the 15 pounds back and more. No matter what I do; I cannot lose weight. Before Byette; my doctor tried many different kinds of pills (example metformin and glumetra) but the sides effects had my life on hold. I had untrollable bowel explosions 24/7. I hhave heard many people say they loss weight on these pills but not me; just the 24/7 bowel explosions. I would like to hear if anyone have ever experience hear loss whille on Victoza. I have not seen anywhere that this is a side effect but my hair began balding in big patches right after I got on Victoza and thinning out. It is still light this and I am so frustrated; conscioused and sometime down over it. I know it could be worse but my hair stylist is convince that it has to e=be my Victoza meds because this was not happening before. I bought expensive all natural hair vitamins with biotin in it that was spposed to help grow my hair back and make it full again but that made it worse. I have gone to a 2nd & 3rd hairstylist for their opinion and they are all at a loss and said it has to be my diabetes medicine. I even went to a a dermattologist but she did not know why it was happening. If anyone have this problem or know why this is happening since I became diabetic please let me know. My endocinologist said the only alternative is to place me on insulin bvut I refused because that would mean more weight gain plus the Victoza is working to keep my glucose under control.	2013	2013		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just found out that I have a TSH lab value of 18.79. What is in my future? I will not see my doctor for 10 days. This value is very high from what I can find out. Is it safe to wait 10 days? Is there anything I should do until my appt? What does it mean? I have never had an elevated value before. I have HOCM. I had a Septal Alcohol Ablation in 2001. I have a defibrillator and pacemaker that was implanted in 2004. I had a cardioversion Nov. 2007. I am a type 2 Diabetic on oral medications. Would any of these issues be related to the TSH report? If stress or depression is a factor I woke up in the middle of the night to find my 51 year old husband dead beside me in 2003. A close cousin passed away in late 2003; two very close aunts in 2004; my father in 2004 and my mother in 2006. It has been a nightmare!	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 53 yr old Male; with a bad family history ( father died of CHF; all his brothers have had Heart Attacks due to blocked arteries. About three year sago I had some Heart palpitations; got about one episode per year ( I know its not much)....but quite scary. I reported this as possible 'Sinus Tachycardia' or SVT.....but never has been proven via Holter. Also did angiograms and showed some atherosclerosis/mild blockage of some heart arteries etc.....but not enough to Stent. I've been on Beta Blockers ( 25 mg Metaprolol Tartrate) for about three years; somewhat tolerated the drug. Used to exercise about 3-4 times a week. But this year; I found out that I also Type Diabetic ( as was my Dad & brother)....I was 'marginally' diabetic i.e. Blood Glucose 109 & A1C = 6.9. AFter trying diet & exercise; although my levels remained the same; my GP put me on 500 mg Metformin. Maybe coincidental; but since taking this drug in combo with my B-blockers; I have developed pretty bad anxitey; sometime inot panic attacks; also experiencing very slow heart rates 65-55 ( that is really slow for me). As a result; I just don't feel exercising; or even getting up to do a 1/2 mile walk ( that is real bad news for someone with some blockage). Its sending me over the edge........really impacting my life. Should I stop the Metformin ( I know I cant stop the B-blocker ). Shoudl I talk to my Cardiologist or GP for how I feel ? I am not sure if something else ( liek allergies etc) is causing my slow heart beat. I also work for a Pacemaker company; and I tend to over-analyze my situation quite a bit i.e. look at my own EKG's ( which looks quite normal).	2011	2011	52	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"As of April 2014 I am a 26 year old female; 5' 8""; 186 lb; otherwise healthy except for the following: Type 2 Diabetes diagnosed in Nov 2011. I was originally put on glyburide and metformin but within six months was taken off metformin and my birth control pill (which I had been on since 2006) due to a small adenoma on my liver found in April 2012. Subsequently I was put on Lantus and Novolog insulin. Autoimmune Pancreatitis diagnosed in April 2012. Originally hospitalized for four days in March; it was thought to be an acute case. In April I ended up back in the ER. I don't drink alcohol regularly (maybe 1-2 times a month and usually a glass of wine or a fruity cocktail) and there were no gallstones. My doctor wasn't sure of the cause of the recurring pancreatitis. I was put on prednisone until June when a stomach infection detected through an endoscopy. In June 2012 I stopped the prednisone and was put on azathioprine as an immunosuppressant. I was hospitalized again in July for four days and was put on nortriptyline to help with the nerve pain. July 2012 while I was dealing with the hospitalization for anther pancreatitis episode I also had an abscess high on my leg; in the groin area. It burst on its own; the doctor gave me antibiotics to deal with the infection and it cleared up and healed well within a week. I chalked this up to being prone to infections due to being diabetic and having a weakened immune system from the immunosuppressant. Everything was fine for a while but around May 2013 my period which had been regular for seven years disappeared. In October 2013 my GYN medroxyprogesterone acetate to restart my cycle which restarted irregularly but was less heavy than previously and has since evened out to be near regular again. October 2013 another leg/groin abscess appeared and was drained and packed by a surgeon; again I took antibiotics to help with the infection. It healed well within a couple of weeks. April 2014 I was diagnosed with anemia and have had two doses of feraheme IV therapy. Another leg/groin abscess has appeared in the same spot as the two previous times. I’m tired of dealing with all these issues and seeing a primary care doc; a GI doc; a hematologist; and a general surgeon. I feel like there must be some connection between these things; perhaps another diagnosis that has been missed. Has anyone ever deal with something similar?"	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My father (born and raised in India) is 71 years old and has been living in the United States for more than 40 years. He has high blood pressure and type 2 Diabetes. He has been suffering from an Unknown Medical Condition since 2007. His symptoms have included: Shortness of breath since July of 2007; even with minimal activity and a 24 hour non-stop throbbing accompanied with sometimes pain and swelling in his head; mainly on the left side (from September 2007). The following tests were conducted to diagnose the throbbing in his head; none of them were conclusive: • He was sent to a Neurologist. The Neurologist thought that it could be “Temporal Arteritis”. He ordered for blood tests “SED rate and C-Reactive Protein” every week for 5 weeks. These results were normal. He also ordered MRI and MRA of his head to make sure he does not have an Aneurysm. The MRI; MRA and regular CT scan of his head did not show any problems. The Neurologist recently told him that he may have a dural AVM; but it will only be confirmed; if he gets an angiogram of his head. He is presently on the following medications: • Glimepiride – 2 mg once day (for BS) • Coreg – 25 mg twice a day (for BP) • Cozaar – 50 mg once a day ((for BP) • Januvia – 100 mg once a day (for BS) • Metformin ER – 500 mg twice a day (for BS) • Lipitor – 10 mg once a day (for Cholesterol) • Amitriptylin – 10 mg once a day (for relaxation) *BS – Blood Sugar *BP – Blood Pressure He’s been to a numerous amounts of doctors since then; and they have no conclusive answer. Obviously; an angiogram of the head is rather invasive; and we’re just looking for possible answers; possible diseases; infections; or anything to diagnose this mystery.	2008	2008

I am presently trying A.C.E. which is supposed to be an all natural weight loss; um NOT..waste of my money...I have so many diagnosis that I don't know what to do what to eat and what ever I do I don't lose weight. I crave suger; carbs as I have no engery all day long and that gives me just a quick fix I understand that but what to do. I am hypothyroid taking Levothyroxine; I have adrenal fatigue; Polycystic ovary Sydrome; High Cholesterol; retaining water like no other; and estrogen dominance and depression/anxiety can't imagine with all of this stuff going on being down. So yes am taking meds for each and then my doctor just put me on Metformin I am not seeing any results from this either. I am so frustrated and desperate a year ago I was 160 down to a size 8 and now I am at 211 and in 14/16's. I was doing the lite for life program when I just crashed and was craving suger like mad...well the sugar overcame me.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I posted the bulk of this in the auto-immune & kidney forums; but I just want to get a ""whadda you think"" from people who have been through all the testing; diagnosis; MISdiagnosis; etc. I will post my current issue; then follow up below it with further background to explain why I feel this might be an appropriate forum for this. I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08; Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight; when there is no logical reason for it. Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone); PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal; just started Metformin therapy). On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June; my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a ""normal"" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website; but no mention was made to me; at my followup appt. On 01-06-10; I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit; my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again; no mention was made of this; although; in his defense; my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels; at this visit; which were very much out of range. I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here; as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59; for a woman; is suggestive of possible kidney damage; and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop; as they have in my case. I am obese (240 lbs); so I know that can affect the numbers; but I also have been plagued; over the yrs; with various auto-immune issues (ITP; Hashimoto's); and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes; that adds yet another concern. I do have some light edema in both legs; at the end of the day & severe pitting edema in my left leg; due to a severe injury in 2004; for which I wear a compression stocking. I know lymphatic system issues are another sign of kidney issues. ****Okay; now let me explain why I am thoroughly confused & troubled by all this (aside from obvious). As mentioned above; I have a history of KNOWN auto-immune problems. I also know that many of these disorders can overlap & you can very easily have more than one. What I can't understand is why the doctors are not discussing my eGFR & creatinine levels with me; given my past/current auto-immune problems & my current pre-diabetic state. My kidney function should be a glaring red flag to them; right now..esp. with the edema. What I did not mention above; but may have mentioned in old; old posts in other forums; is that I did have one ANA test done; a few yrs ago; after I saw my PCP for a VERY bizarre (for me) reaction to the sun. I am as lily white as they come & don't get deliberate exposure to the sun very often at all. That summer; I got a wild hair to add some color. On the very 1st attempt to sunbathe in my back yard; I had only been lying on the lawn chair for about 5 min. when my whole body started itching like ants were attacking me all over. I jumped up; thinking I had lain in an ant bed. Nothing. I tried to lay back down; but the itching was unbearable. I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to the sunscreen or the plastic on the chair; so I went in & took a shower. Within 30 min; I was covered head to toe in a ""chigger-like"" rash. My husband looked at it & said ""You have chiggers!"" We live in an area not known for chigger infestations; but I mentioned this to my PCP; & he agreed it was not likely chiggers. Because of the past auto-immune stuff; he ran the ANA; but it came back negative; so he diagnosed ""contact dermatitis; unknown cause"". I am now wondering; with everything else; if I didn't have a Lupus flare; despite the negative ANA. I've been too scared to tempt fate with the sun again. Also; since then; I have recurrent urticarial flares (hives); which sometimes cause my eyes & throat to swell shut (anaphylaxis). My PCP could not find a cause for that either; so he just wrote me an RX for an Epi Pen. Even if it isn't Lupus; I am very; very concerned & worried abt what might be happening to my kidneys. My understanding is that you can slow the drop of your eGFR & slow or stop the progression of kidney disease; but you can never regain those numbers or that function back. Kidney disease is nothing I want to mess around with. Any thoughts? Thanks; Angela"	2007	2010

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Looking for any suggestions to take back to my Endocrinologist. 33 female 2.5 yrs now suffering w/these symptoms (ill list below) I've gone to many Primary doctors & Endo's begging for help. I've had many test done (multiple times); full thyroid panel is ""perfect""; Negative for Cushings; IR/Diabetes; STDs/HIV; TB. I DO have low cortisol; Low Vitamin D; High testosterone. I have pcos & whatever is wrong w/me has made my pcos go Haywire. Pcos became worse AFTER this ""illness"" started up. Vitamin d won't/hasn't come back up w/meds. Was put on BC pills for the pcos; which 1 has made my symptoms even worse 2 I know BC is not proper treatment. Weight gain-packed it on fast-60+lbs Goiter- seen w/ultrasound goiter w/two nodules. It goes up & down in size. It was choking me; they started to shrink. Now going back up but feels like a mans 'Adams apple'. It feel like it's being pressed into my throat; it's sore & burns 24/7. No sore throat though. (I have no tonsils FYI) Stress-I get really angry or cry easily Heart palpitations(?) like a chugging/clogged feeling that makes me gasp for air. It happens at least 3x a week. I can be awoken out of my sleep; just sitting calmly etc. it happens. Brain fog-light headed; dizzy; confusion; can't think or speak properly often. No energy-never a boost; 24/7 its low I want to sleep all day but can't sleep but 3-5hrs. Skin has become very dry a little itchy all over. Now on back of hands & a few other spots on arms; become red. If I feel really sick backs of hands turn red/itch. Lost a lot of hair & my scalp feels tender; no sores. My mild life long anxiety has become Agoraphobia. I take Ativan now (only as needed. maybe 1x a week) no; I'm not addicted. I don't take it unless I'm having attack. My attacks come out of no where; I have no warning. I treat it during & not before. Doc gave the ok. Depression has become worse (of course) I've noticed a very tiny droop to left side of face. Left top eyelid droops lower; left cheek & left corner of mouth look a little off and a tad lower. I've had this odd back pain in the right kidney area. I was checked by CT scan; ultrasound & told kidney looks fine; urine is fine. Now it's happening on the left side. Hot stabbing & throbbing feeling. Scared because my Mom almost died from Kidney disease as a kid. I also have IBS-d (just always told I have it) Told possibly gluten allergies too Never been checked for Chrons I'm getting some unknown infection showing up in blood work 4 times last year. One of the times my surgeon (had emergency gall bladder surgery.) said I have an infection that couldn't be traced & they didn't believe it to be linked w/gall bladder. I stayed extra 3 days (total of 5) in hospital because they said basically the meds were having a very hard time attacking the infection. No info on WTH all that was about. (I'm extremely allergic to Penicillin if that matters?) My doctors say this or that is odd but apparently aren't concerned to dig deeper. I was put on Phentermine for my weight (it doesn't bother my anxiety or panic; odd I know) plus b12 injections weekly. None of that has ever given me energy; at all. I take half the pill & fall back asleep; no prob. It has helped w/ appetite control & im losing weight. As I said before I'm on BC pills; I take magnesium (uterine issues); prenatal Vitamins; prescription vit D 2xweek. I WAS taking Metformin & Myo-ino for pcos; it did nothing. Newer Endo said I shouldn't have ever been on those. (I have type2 pcos; no IR/No diabetes). I don't want any more pills thrown at me unless I actually need them. Therapy is now suggested; great but now more pills. If my mental is becoming worse from a condition/illness/disease/disorder wouldn't fixing that help the mental. Therefore more drugs for mental aren't really needed. IMO! I rarely ever drink caffeine; no coffee. Once in awhile Green tea. I drink loads of water daily. I never drink any alcohol; no smoking; no drug abuse/use. I try keep down on dairy (im lactose intolerant) I avoid soy (bad for my pcos) Wondering if it's thyroid; adrenals; pituitary gland ??"	2016	2017		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I've had sphincter of oddi for years now; and finally got relief from Gabapentin. I think that everyone who has sphinter of oddi with normal liver results should try it. My tests are always normal; except 2 times that i had blood tests during attacks they were elevated. This would put me in the type III category of SOD. Gabapentin took away my attacks almost completely; which were ridiculously painful and happening at least a few times a week. Unfortunately; I still dont feel that great in other areas of the stomach; so im still searching for another medication that will take away all of my pains. Has anyone taken any other meds for this condition that seem to work???????	2009	2009	26	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi Am not having much luck with doctors at the moment. Since late oct i had extreme coldness in right leg and foot (i have achilles tendonitis in it) i went to my gp who said foot pulse was opk and should go away. Since then; it has got worse. it in both legs and hands and arms. (worse on right side) I get tingling in them too. Plus spasms/twitches in my fingers. Been back to my gp who says could be raynauds. But i dont have the typical white fingers etc for that. Its worse at night and gets painful. I had briefly mentioned to my neuro but he didnt seem interested only if it was related to my seizures. I have had it twice after a seizure in my arm. He did a thyroid test and that was normal. I just dont know what to do and my gp keeps saying come back when the weather gets better see if it gets any better. History Temporal lobe epilepsy since 2009.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	If this isn't quite appropriate for this forum; apologies - Diagnosed with PCOS about 10 years ago. Currently almost 40 and in beginning the process toward IUI; discovered my total testosterone has become very elevated - 347 last year (not caught my regular doctor) and 588 this July. Believed that the finasteride is what kept symptoms at bay all that time; combined with the knowledge PCOS gave me some hair and menstrual issues all along. My left ovary is enlarged (3.5cm measurements; versus 2.5 for the right); but I believe was enlarged 10 years ago during the ultrasound done 10 years ago. Adrenals show no issue in bloodwork and pelvic & abdominal MRI came in w/no noted abnormalities beyond PCOS appearance of ovaries. My repro endo says these numbers are too high to be anything but a tumor most likely; and a ovarian vein sampling requested by gyn onc came up with testosterone on the left ovary of 517 and the right at 314. Also being checked by regular endo for Cushing's or other potential long shots. I'm being told if both ovaries are producing those levels; there has to be tumors and both ovaries will have to come out. Given this started on a desire to attempt conception; needless to say I'd prefer to not lose ability to use my own eggs if possible. Since the tumors are not showing up readily; is there a test that would better pinpoint them to allow removal of only part of the ovary perhaps? Is appearance of tumors secreting testosterone in both ovaries simultaneously illogical in any way? Thanks!	2010	2010		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I REALLY REALLY enjoy everybody's company here; but in all honesty; I do not belong. It is very clear I do not have MS but some kind of neuropathy. And as each day goes by; it's also pretty clearn what kind of neuropathy I must have and that is diabetic neuropathy. My BS's today were horrid - 2 hrs. after eating lunch which consisted of one Lean Cuisine Pizza and a handful of nuts was 173. I had no idea my numbers have been so high lately. Just two months ago; I was pretty normal with numbers. Just a measly gain of 6 lbs. and possibly this new med (Neurotonin) has pushed me over the edge as Quix said in an earlier post. I am going to call my Dr. on Monday and ask him to order the Glucose Tolerance Test and see just how bad it is. I have been ""pre-diabetic"" for about 5 years now - well; I guess I have crossed that bridge now; just like my Mom; my Uncle; my deceased Grandfather; and my husband. Uggggh. I'm feeling kind of down right now you guys. Anyway; on a good note; the compression stockings and the crocs did work today. I hardly felt any burning at all."	2007	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	hello i was diagnosed in 1995 with Graves disease. I drank radioactive iodine and after several attempts i got my thyroid under control with synthroid. Ive had to change my doses due to my test becoming abnormal or high again. I started out at .75 and now Im up to .175 per day. Well the recent test i had done 4 weeks ago said my TSH was 13. So they repeated it last week and now its 16. I am scared. I am confused as to why it keeps going up. I have other health issues like diabetes type 2 (just recently diagnosed borderline etc) no meds just exercise and diet. Im morbidly obese. i am recently diagnosed with hypertension. 168/92 .... I weigh 316. I did weigh 335 but have lost since jan 1st; 2008. I guess the thing that scares me is this all is hitting me at once. I am going to lose weight to get down to my ideal BMI. I know my weight is alot of my problem and these problems would go away with weight loss. But why does my TSH keep going up? What are my risks? Is this dangerously high? Why wont my doctor take time to talk to me. I am so worried. please help me. He is increasing my synthroid to .175 .. 7 days a week instead of 5 days a week with 2 days being only a half a tablet. Its so confusing. :( Im just so upset. All the good doctors i had have retired or quit. I need some advice fast im so depressed and crying. Thank you Linda	2008	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi I am new to this board but wanted to ask how much can I rely on the snapshot Thyroid Tests? I have been dealing with the following symptoms since I was in my teens: severe fatigue; menstrual problems; chronic anemia; depression; pain for no apparent reason; brittle skin and hair; plantar fasciitis ; depression; anxiety and sleep problems. i have been to see general practitioners who diagnosed me with depression and put me on antidepressants which have not helped. I have seen gynecologists who have diagnosed me with PMS; Post- Partum Depression; Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder; Uterine Tumors; Early Menopause and one simply said I was lazy. Every doctor has had the same theme though by listening to my story and symptoms and immediately ordering thyroid testing. Every time my tests come back with my results in the middle of the normal range. Therefore the doctors all tell me since my tests are normal; there is nothing wrong with me and then give me an antidepressant prescription. I know something is wrong but how can I prove it if my tests results won't show the doctors?	2013	2013	38	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had diabetes type 2 for 5 years and was managing it well with 3 x 500mg Metformin per day and diet and excercise. But unfotunately just before last Christmas I started to experience severe pain in both thighs (quad muscles) and both knees. After being admitted to hospital three times. I was diagnosed with the very rare diabetic complication Amyotrophy also other perrifial neuropathic problems in my lower legs in the shin bone are but not my feet or ankles. The hospital pain management team prescibed the 'convulsion' drug Gabapentin x 300mg one 3 times a day. Plus Doulepin 25mg in the morning and 75mg at night and 1 tamazapan 10mg at night plus co-proximal as required; plus 40mg statin at night. Three days after starting the Gabapentin and Dosulepin the severe pain in my thighs was reduced by about 90%. Unfortunately after taking these drugs for three months I have developed painful athritic pains and stiffness in both my shoulders and right hand. Is this a side affect of the drugs or is it part of my neuropathic nerve damage spreading to other parts of my body? I have lost over a stone in weight in the last 6 months; have muscle wastage and weakness in both thighs but mostly my left thigh. I can walk about 200 metres with a 'roller' walking aid; and about 50 metres with a walking stick.What is the prognosis of my condition? And are there any other readers who have this rare complication. If so I would love to hear their story. Thank you. Simon Male non - smoking age 53 from Buckinghamshire; England.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Iwas diagnosed with Diabetes in May. I am 38. 158lbs.(170 at diagnosis) Tried all the orals : Metformin;glyburide;actos. Sugars were controlled;but felt terrible. My tests indicate to Drs. I am or am becoming type 1 and concerned with weight loss so placed on insulin. Lantus -5 units. Sugars are controlled and A1c in the 6'es. The big problem is that I am basically foggyheaded all the time upon awakening. Unclear; drunk feeling although not like I am going to fall down. they have checked adrenal glands; thyroid;etc. there seems to be no pattern with sugar levels. Could it be the suger levels; or insulin itself?? Or something else. Blood flow to the brain issue. I have always been healthy and active. Now I am out of work and struggling with day to day activities. Any ideas appreciated.	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"39 year old female. Had my gallbladder removed at 21 and history of dormant HSV-2 and early onset Type-2 diabetes; foot and ankle arthritis and mild disk degenerative disorder and fungal infections in both foot and hand nails. Since my early to mid 20's I have experienced overwhelming cramping & bloating after eating which results in both constipation and diarrhea. Cramps are so bad that it stiffen's my entire body until it passes and occurs usually within 5 minutes after eating. Immediately after I often have to rush to the restroom and experience diarrhea. If I was to attempt to go into the restroom before my gut goes through it's ""process"" nothing will happen except a feeling of being nauseated. Over the years; I have also been experiencing sporadic nerve issues; seemingly unrelated; but worth the mention; including; Bell palsy at 29 years old to the right side of my face; bi-lateral carpal & cubital tunnel syndrome (diagnosed at the same time); paresthesia (pin prick sensation) mostly in my top and bottom lip; back of my right eye and occasionally in my legs. Intense bilateral neuropathic nerve pain and inflammation at the dorsal surface of my foot. Pain on both feet seems to stem from the either the Peroneal or Medial Cutaneous nerves and includes a ganglion cyst. Have increasingly developed Gait Instability. Have also experienced many muscle spasms across the body; including feet; calves; inner thighs; lower and side abdominal along with back and front of next. Over the last few years I have also been increasingly been having many cognitive issues. Such as progressive aphasia; brain fogginess; malaise; an overall feeling of being drunk or high without drinking; a pressure in my head while laying flat down or walking to certain areas; my body becomes numb or stiff feeling (especially the tops of my hands; fingers; face; cheeks; tops of arms and legs); slightly slurred speech; the inability to think straight and feeling disoriented or disconnected; unbalanced while walking or standing; along with anxiety; depression. I have also battled with recurrent episodes of having Cellulitis underneath my breasts; lower abdominal and inner thigh; which are always painful and often have to be lanced as they can grow out of control within 24 hr of first onset.. I have been tested and ruled out for having MRSA. Due to the many times of being on antibiotics; I now combat Oral Thrush whenever I have to take an antibiotic which results in me having to follow a regime of Antibiotic then 2 does of 200 mg Fluconazole and then 100;000 unit of Nystatin for an unknown determined of days until the thrush goes away. I have also developed bumps on the back of my tongue due to this; which make it difficult to swallow. I have also been noticing over the last 3-4 years that I will occasionally develop what resembles petechiae near the proximal base of my 2nd through 4th digits on each of my hands. It does not itch; burn or tingle and is smooth to the touch. It appears for no known reasons and stays for a couple weeks or so and then goes away as quickly as it appeared. It will then come back later; again for some unknown reason or apparent trauma. Over the 3-4 years or so it has occurred approximately 5-7 times. I thought at first that it may be Dermatitis Herpetiformis; however; I do not have Celiac's disease; nor is it painful. Throughout all of my symptoms I have never developed a known fever or loss of appetite and have no fissures; bleeding or ulcers. I have also never had to be hospitalized for any of my symptoms. I did once go a to the ER a few years ago because one of my legs swelled up pretty significantly; but all my blood tests came back fine and was sent home. I Have recently been given many tests without a definite diagnose as of yet. Have had the following routine blood tests that have all been within perfect range; CMP; Lipid; Urinalysis; Microalbumin/Creat Urine Ratio; TSH; T4 Free and CBC. Have also had non routine tests done such as DHEA; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Luteinizing Hormone; Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cortisol; DHEA-Sulfate; Ferritin & Magnesium RBC; all in which have been normal. My doctor also had me do a Reticulin Antibodies; and Endomysial Antibody and Celiac Eval; which also came back as negative. The only tests that she was concerned about was that my Blood Sugar which was averaged at 148 and that my A1C was 7.5; but I managed to bring it down to 7.0 within 6 weeks; in addition; my B12 was down at 260 pg/mL and my the vitamin D 25-hydroxy came back at 16 ng/M. In addition; my iron was slightly low; but I can't recall what it was; but I do know that I was not considered anemic. She has put me on 1cc B12 injections every two weeks and 50;000 units of Vitamin D2 1x weekly. I am also taking an array of medication to combat the pain and diabetes; including Gabapentin 300mg 3x daily; Celebrex 1mg 1x daily; Glimepiride 1mg 1x daily; Metformin 1000 mg 2x daily and Protonix 40 mg 1x daily. I have also been tested for Diabetic Neuropathy and that test also came back perfectly fine. My doctor thinks I may have a susceptibility to mold which could be the leading cause of all my issues; however; many of my issues have been going on for many years and I have lived in many different places since then and have never known to have a mold issue in any home I've lived in. She is going to have Integrative Medicine doctor to an HLA-DR genetic test on me to rule that out. She has also ordered me to have an MRI to rule out MS and also to undergo Physical Therapy for my feet as well as Pelvic Floor Therapy to help aid in my urinary incontinence and bladder issues. I have to say that my doctor is absolutely wonderful and we are just at the beginning of this hunt; but am still concerned that we may be missing something. I know that not all my symptoms are related to one another; but I do strongly feel that most of them are. I am hoping that someone out there may be able to help me and see something that we may not and help to lead us into the right direction. I have thought of many scenario's that may be causing all of this and am at a loss. I don't think it's Lupus because my symptoms are ongoing for the most part and I don't have episodes of a ""flare up"" as well as my kidney functions are fine and no hair loss or scaly or red rashes. I also don't believe it's Crohn's because I also don't fit many of those symptoms. I have often thought it's possible that maybe that I have a Candida overgrowth especially in my gut as that does follow many of my symptoms; I just can't determine if that would cause sporadic nerve issues. I have also often wondered if being that my HSV-2 is a central nervous system disease and it has basically always stayed ""dormant"" because I have only had one break out once in my life if instead it is attacking my nervous system than it is causing or creating physical lesions. I was once told that it could have been the reason why I had Bells Palsy so I guess the thought isn't too far fetched. And also who knows all of this could be due to my vitamin B-12 deficiency and I could have already found the culprit. If any one that may be able to tell me if any of this may lead to something I would be forever grateful because I am tried of living this way. It prevents me from living the life I know I deserve and has essentially killed every bit of dignity and confidence that I ever had and I am ready to take my life back and battle whatever it is I'm fighting. I apologize for the long list; but I felt it was better to give the whole story than to only give a few things that could really be anything."	2018	2018	39	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Thank you John and also you too sara for your comments. We have updated the post with the consultants words and medication list. Hope this helps; please keep us informed; and we likewise of any further developments. Thanks Dave n Nicola 3years ago I had a mild stroke; and since that day; ive been having TIA type attacks near daily. WHY? I need answers and help PLEASE. Hi my name is Dave. I am requiring any help feedback; as to whether anyone else seems to have or have had recurring stroke like symptoms; 3years after a small stroke. With the help of my wife and others; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company; I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. This was due to 20years 15hour day 6/7days a week workaholic lifestyle; in senior business management and also running my own part-time business as well as working for private and public companies. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old. Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago whilst having a nice stroll near the beach at Cleethorpes; with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy so we decided to drive back home to Doncaster. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. Luckily my 24year old daughter who had just popped in mentioned to my wife; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; ‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’ I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months; I have not hardly had a recurrence; just slight shakes now and then. These episodic attacks are now as frequent as three times a day and sometimes 7days a week; where I suffer episodes of stroke type symptoms; during my sleep; and twice during the day. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a bad attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; which then ends with me displaying the symptoms as already described on numerous occasions and literally ends with me sleeping heavily; and my leg and arm feels like a lead weight; these have been seen by many medical professionals within Royal Hallamshire Sheffield Hospital; Doncaster Hospital; the nurses at the local GP and local CMHT. A heavy attack has the following symptoms; dizziness; pain in my head; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so. These attacks happen during my sleep; as my wife is unable to wake me up in the morning and when i do finally wake up; i have the tell-tale left sided face droop etc; they can happen anytime of the day; whilst I am sat watching tv etc. sometimes 2 to 3 times a day for up-to 7days. My memory is terrible; i am unable to concentrate for long periods; i also lose my balance a lot; and I sometimes have a very severe pain; behind my left eye socket; and this does not go away with painkillers. However after an attack; my limbs are weak for a day after. Once i have recovered ie woken up after a sleep from 2 to 4hrs; i feels sometimes like I am drunk and very hung-over for a day or two; I am completely washed out; with varying pains; headaches and i am unable to walk once these attacks happen and i am very weak on my left side leg and arm daily and on-going. I get dizzy spells during an attack and also when im not having an attack. Also I am slurring; or mumbling during an attack; my speech is clear when I am not suffering attacks however my wife and children have stated that sometimes i say the wrong words or whilst speaking sometimes put the wrong words that im trying to say; in the wrong part of a sentence; which they find amusing; and i find frustrating and angry with myself for doing that; but i do not have slurred speech outside an attack unless I am tired. . My vision has deteriorated since the stroke; and my left eyesight is terrible; i have just been diagnosed with glaucoma and diabetes and early stages of diabetic retinopathy; however the medics are looking into my eyesight issues but with no joy. I have also been experiencing in addition to the other symptoms; pain in my bones on my left side and back; especially when i retires to bed at night; to the point where we have had to obtain a loan to purchase; a £3000 hospital type adjustable bed; which has not really alleviated the pain. I am under a psychiatrist for depression; but nothing seems to be working for me; I am on medication; I have been tried on different medication over the 8years and im currently on 40mg of fluoxetine a day. My depression seems deeper since the stroke and i am struggling daily.	2012	2012	47	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Dear Doc; About 6 months ago; I was driving down the highway and had a panic attack out of no where. I am not sure where it came from. I have had heart palpations for a long time but nothing has come of it. They became worse so I worried about them. I have been a worry my whole time. I have pre-hypertension blood pressure and about 6 months when the panic attacks started began taking blood pressure medicine. Since then I have had ECG; EKG; MRI; CT; CCTA and multiple extensive blood work and lab test done. I have tried multiple anti-depressants and recently taking Wellbrutin and Buspar for depression and anxiety. I was recently diagnosed with an Anxiexty Disorder that lead to depression but my bottom line question that no one can answer is....ever since this started 6 months NO MATTER how many medicines I take or currently taking I have this feeling that I am drunk or having a buzz like I have been drinking. This feeling will not go away and none of the medications have helped this. Do you have any suggsetions? Frustrated....	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm going to tell you my story; and I would really like to hear from anyone who has had similar experiences. I have always had acne since about grade 7. My periods started getting kind of wacky; and when I was 18 I started noticing hair growing on my lower stomach. I immediately freaked out! (Like any other normal woman would) and went to every possible doctor I could. I was even having very intense pains running down my inner thigh coming from my lower abdominals. I saw one doctor who suggested to me that I may have PCOS. I was living down south and I came back home. I went to see my doctor here because I was also having very disheartening emotional problems (depression and anxiety). She started me on Diane -35 (birth control) to lower my androgens and suggested I start taking spironolactone. I only started taking the birth control pills and within 3 or 4 months of starting it I was so depressed and anxiety ridden that I had to stop taking the pill. I immediately noticed a difference in my moods improving (but not completely) and I knew then that I was going to have to find an alternative option to the birth control pill. I went to my doctor numerous times as the hair kept growing and spreading. I have had my hormones all tested many times and I have elevated male hormones but they are not outside of the normal range. WELL HOW COULD I BE GROWING HAIR ON MY STOMACH IF MY LEVELS WERE NORMAL? My doctor told me ""some women are harrier; your background could contribute to it.... by the way I'm German and I didn’t know they were supposed to be sasquatches) I kept asking for more tests though and my triglycerides were high; and prolactin was high. Meanwhile; I’m not on any pills and I am completely frustrated! Not to mention the anxiety and moods/depression that I still live with everyday. I started having laser hair treatments. I bought a book on how to treat PCOS with natural health. I asked to be tested for insulin resistance (which is linked to PCOS) and my results were inconclusive; and apparently I had a test which rarely even shows insulin resistance. I finally got a new doctor; who FINALLY booked me for an ultrasound (I’m 22 now). I got it done; and what do you know!!! I have one abnormally large cyst on my left ovary and small cysts covering both of them. AND after all that time; I finally find out what’s actually happening to me. But they still haven’t been able to help me. They just keep trying to prescribe me medications! Do you want Diane 35? No; my body can’t handle it for some reason. Do you want to take spironolactone? No; Id rather not take a diuretic; or chance what happened when I took Diane 35 for the first time. So doctor; what does this mean for me? Do I have PCOS? Am I insulin resistant? Will I be infertile? Doctor: just because you have cysts doesn’t mean its pcos; or that you are insulin resistant. We won’t worry about you being infertile until you think about having kids... Well wouldn’t you think that I would like to know now so that I can make changes in my life to make sure I can have kids? Anyway sorry to veer off and start complaining about the medical system. The point it; I have gotten no help. I have seen multiple doctors; naturopaths; and a gynecologist. I have tried diets for hormone health; including organic natural foods; low GI foods; read books on hormone health and pcos. I have taken herbal remedies for the hair growth. I've lost weight; (I’m not even that big to begin with); worked out; and I still don’t seem to be getting anywhere real fast. Right now I am 22; I am on alesse (which has more minimalistic side effects on me; but still causes mood swings and depression); and I am doing laser. (Which I have to say is expensive but the best thing I have found so far) Has anyone else had these types of experiences? Does anyone have any suggestions? Does anyone want a buddy to share stories with?"	2008	2008	21	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 52 year old women who has had gallbladder surgery in April of 2006. It was infected. Ever since I have had the gallbladder surgery; I keep getting sick. I vomit a lot and end up with diarrehea and sometimes both at the same time. I am also a diabetic. I have type 2 diabetes. I am unable to eat the proper foods due to the damage bile duct. I could not figure out as to why I keep getting sick up until a year ago when I came down with a real bad kidney infection. My dr. thought I had kidney stones so was sent in to have a CT done. I did not have kidney stones. What was found was a narrow bile duct due to the gallbladder surgery. I was sent to a dr. to have this taken care of by having the dr. to put a stent into my bile duct. Well; he could not get the stent into the bile duct due to it is so narrow according to him. He told me that he would try again. He never did try again. I suffer a lot with this issue. I get pain on my right side where my gallbladder use to be; indigestion so bad and cramping in my abomen plus diarrehea and I also vomit a lot. My stomach swells up as well. I am either constapathed of getting sick from the diarrehea and vomiting all the time. I have to be careful as to what I eat. Is there any type of other surgery that will help open up my bile duct? I am at my witts end and can't take getting sick anymore. It hits me in the middle of the night when I am sleeping. It discusses me to no end having to deal with this issue. I have no control over the diarrehea and the vomiting. My Metformin most of the time; I find it in the toilet in the mornings. ( It does not dissolve) I am on Nexium and without taking the Nexium; I am worse off. I need help here. After reading some articles online; this is scaring me.I read that this can be dangerous to most people. I also had colon surgery 27 years ago this past March. I had a tumor on my colon plus a couple of polyps. It was all benign but they had to remove a 3rd of my colon. I never suffered from any type of sickness afterwards like I do now. So I know my symptoms are not from having the colon sugery. Please help!!!	2011	2011	51	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Please help me understand my readings: 3/24/2012-TSH 0.236; Free T4 1.00 4/16/2012- Anti-Microsomal 599 IU/ml Thyroglobulin Ab <20 IU/ml 5/16/2012-TSH 0.693 Free T4 0.98 Free T3 3.74 7/5/2012-TSH 1.307 uIU/mL Free T4 1.04 ng/dl Microalbumin 30 mg/L mg/L I was excited thinking I don't have hypo/hashi's with the now normal tsh levels. However; my PCP; informed me because of the Anti-Microsomal 599 IU/ml being so high; that's how it's determined. Anyhow; he told me that he's happy to see that my tsh levels are back to normal; but in time they'll go off the chart that he was using in explaining to me. He said it's at that time; he'd put me on medicine's. I;ve read because the Anti-Microsomal are high; even though the tsh levels are normal now; I should be on medicine. Please advise as to your opinion. I'm real concerned; because I now have high liver enzymes and from what I've read the reason could be from the hypo/hashi's? therefore; in the meantime I'm unable to take my metformin and lipitor. In the meantime he had me go for a thyroid ultrasound and the results of that are normal. It reads: The right lobe measures 4.1 x 1.5x1.5 cm. The left lobe measures 3.8 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. Heterogeneous thyroid parenchymal echotexture without evidence of a discrete nodule. My understanding is that if my ultrasound was normal; there would be no concern of thyroid cancer and no reason for a thyroid scan. Am I correct? or am I missing something? Thank you for your assistance in this matter. Tags: Thyroid	2012	2012	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 13 years ago and was put on Synthroid. I'm a 53-year-old female. About five years ago; my current doctor added Liothyronine. I have been on 88 mcg Levothyroxine and 25 mcg Liothyronine for a while now My blood results from a few weeks ago included TSH .07 (.34-4.82); T4 (Thyroxine) Free .59 (.52-1.4); T3 (Triiodothyronine) Total 118 (60-181); and T3 Reverse 11 (8-25). My doctor tried to explain to me twice how my TSH at .07 was normal; but I still don't understand. She didn't change any dosages on my thyroid meds. In the meantime; I've been having a lot of heartburn; constant sore throat (which doesn't look red when looking through my mouth because it's deeper down); a raspy voice; crackling sounds in the back of my throat; wheezing; and generally feeling really run down and tired. I saw an ENT who doubled my Prilosec for a month; put me on a heartburn diet; and has me doing nasal saline rinses twice a day. A month later; the upper chest burn moved down to my gut (for which I will now see a gastroenterologist); but the throat pain and raspy voice were not any better. Looking through my nose with a scope; he saw infection deep in my throat; so he put me on an antibiotic. He also found a nodule on my thyroid; so he sent me for an ultrasound. The ENT office called me late yesterday afternoon to tell me they had my US results and to make sure I keep my follow-up appointment; which isn't until Sept. 3. Of course; my thought is that if the results were fine; they would have just told me that; so now I'm a bit apprehensive. To add to all this; I'm anemic; type 2 diabetic; hypertensive; and have fibromyalgia. I'm also a 7-year breast cancer survivor. Does anyone have any thoughts for me about any of this; or do you need any more info? Thanks for reading.	2014	2014		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Today is day 10 - I still don't feel great. Last night the rls was bad. How long until that part goes away ? On a much more frightening note. I am blind in one eye. I was just diagnosed with having a cataract in my good eye and I need surgery. I'm 43 yrs old. I also have diabetic retinopathy (controlled) in my good eye so that makes the cataract surgery; potentially; more complicated. When I have the surgery done; am I going to be ""hooked"" on pain killers again ?? Can I do something to avoid that happening ? So far; it looks like the surgery may be scheduled for the end of this month and I'm not looking forward to it because of the risks involved. I'm stressed and having a hard time with this.."	2007	2007	43	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	10 months ago I became over medicated and my doc has been lowering my dose of Tirosint by 12 mcgs ever since. A week or so ago my eyes had a flare up of swelling; running and aching [have had this when under medicated too] apparently it isn't too common because I posted about this with not much response. Now I have fluid retention else where too [maybe I had too much sodium] and my digestion is slow with reflux again. I have had the jitters off and on; trembling; racing heart at times; but now feeling tired/slow;; palps have stopped. My doc lowered my dose again; 4 days ago to 88mcgs Tirosint; I was told to stay at 12.5mcgs Cytomel. Every lab done before this had had a FT4 at the very top of the range; FT3 has been at the upper 2/3 or higher; no TSH and high RT3. Here are my labs from last week; before dose lowered: 100mcgs Tirosint 12Cytomel TSH less than 0.006 FT4 Direct 1.48 0.8-177 FT3 3.3 2.0-4.4pg/ml RT3 24.1 9.2-24.1ng/dl Do you think the RT3 could improve as I lower the T4? Am I over medicted or do I need additional Cytomel for the fluid; vision thing? Any opinion would be helpful! I have Hashi's and my last labs where good on iron; D etc... But I do have some low cortisol in the AM; based on saliva testing. My last labs on Cholesterol and Trigs where very high; also my A1C was high...which is unbelievable because I eat so well; so I think my thyroid meds are not working at the cellular level; hence the high RT3 [which my doc is not concerned about] She's about ready to put me on Statins and Metformin. Had none of this until my thyroid got wacked out..gained 30lbs in 3 months; the vision issue and totally debilitated from pain and my body not functioning properly. Have not been right since. I wonder if I may have Graves as well; will ask for that test! Very concerned that this is causing permanent damage to my organs and bones...put my doctor has no sense of urgency. Thank you so much for your help!	2012	2013	49	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just got copies of my MRI's and MRI reports and was wondering if any of you may know what it means. I have figured out what some of it means; but not so sure about the rest. I will post a few of the slides a little later on. It was done on a 1.5T machine. I have never truly thought I had MS; but I kind of figured thats what the neuro sent me for the MRI for just to rule it out. I do however; still think there is something neurological going on. I do know there is something wrong and I have felt like total **** for over a year now. I am tired of being tired....lol I just want answers!! I am still having numbness in my arms and legs; along with severe muscle cramps (sometimes it feels deeper that just muscles) and a buzzing sensation in different areas of my body. I have had lab work to rule out electrolyte imbalances; ect... for the muscle cramps. My muscle's actually knot up (you can feel the knots) and you can sometimes visibly see them. I am also still having the zap feelings in my neck and muscle twitching in my extremities. Have any of you had the problems with the muscle pain and knotting? I am at the end of my rope with all of the pain and no answers. I need help and it seems like none of the doctors listen to me!!! It took me a year of explaining about my head pressure before I finally figured out what it was; and it was my eye doctor who figured it out!! Anyway this is what the reports say: C-Spine -moderate reversal of cervical lordosis -multilevel slight disc bulges from C3-4 to C6-7 -uncovertebral joint disease is greater on right at C3-4 w/moderate right neural foraminal narrowing and relative effacement of right lateral recess. -craniocervical junction is unremarkable. Brain -ventricular system and basal cisterns are grossly normal -vascular flow voids are normal in T1 and T2 weighted images -mucosal thickening in ethmoids -nasal septum deviation- convexity towards left -post-contrast imaging demonstrates a developmental venous anomaly in left frontoparietal region I also wanted to ask about bladder issues. I have had waken up in the middle of the night a couple of times feeling warmth from urine leaking and try to get out of bed to use the bathroom and completely lose my bladder. I didn't feel the urge to urinate either time and while trying to stand up; and while walking to the bathroom the urine just kept coming and I couldn't control it. Have any of you had this problem? Thanks for reading and God Bless!! Miranda	2007	2008	27	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I finally went to the Endo last week because of all the symptoms I am having and thought I was having an issue with my thyroid. Tests came back within the ""normal"" range. I am a 43 yr old female. I have Fibromyalgia and have for over 10 years; so I'm achy; but to me that's just ""normal"". I have gained (according to them 50lbs but according to my scale about 35lbs in 9 months). I work out 3-4 days a week. I have a pretty decent diet; not big on junk food. I'm always tired (I even yawn at the gym!!) regardless of how much sleep I get. I have zero sex drive. Dry/Brittle Hair My hands get cold for no reason. I have bad night sweats Constipation My mood swings are horrid Dry skin (but I live in Colorado...so it's normal for here). The only tests the Endo did was the TSH and Free 4. Along with 2 for diabetes (thankfully those are ""normal"" and I don't believe that's the issue anyways). She put me on Metformin to help with the weight loss. But has stated ""your thyroid is not the reason for your weight gain"". Great...but something is! I'm not eating McDonalds every day or a dozen jelly donuts a day! She never once addressed my Fibromyalgia as an underlying problem. I have a friend who has been diagnosed; and she thinks I should go to her Dr. who does much more extensive testing. If I don't get myself ""fixed""; it'll probably be an end to my relationship. Not due to the weight gain (he's been very supportive with this); but more the mood swings. I'm not pleasant to be around sometimes. I don't think the endo did enough to find out what is really happening..just put me on a drug for weightloss instead. Suggestions on what other tests should be done? I know my body..and this is NOT me. Something is off and I need to find out what the root cause is. Thanks!!"	2012	2012		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. I hope someone can help. I'm an American that has been living in Qatar for the past eight months. This problem I have has been bothering me for most of this time. My wife isn't experiencing the same symptoms. I often wake up at before dawn with extremely itchy legs. It usually happens at that time; and only when I'm at home. Only my legs display these symptoms. They do feel itchy sometimes after a shower; but not as severe (almost like an after-effect of whatever bothered me at night). I am a deep sleeper; and this itch on both my legs doesn't fail to wake me up night after night; month after month. I use moisturizer hoping that it helps (it doesn't). I recently came back from a visit to the US; and I can say I never woke up from itching while there. A few days after getting there; I forgot that I had the problem at all. When I got back; I was going to sleep around dawn each night. Interestingly; the problem didn't come back until tonight. I went to bed earlier; and woke up with the same intense itching as before about an hour and a half before dawn. I thought it might be bed bugs because of the timing of the itch; but as I understand it they leave visible bumps. I have none (just intense itching at that time of night). Dust mites might be present here; and I may be allergic. However; I don't display any other symptoms of being allergic to something right now. And why is it only my legs that are itching? And why only intensely an hour before dawn? It's not soap; detergent; or the fabric I wear (I've tried eliminating those things already). What am I missing? Just in case someone thinks I may be crazy; I can now prove I'm not. I just talked to my father who was here for a visit; and he admitted to me that he had the same exact symptoms while staying here in my house an few days ago. Please help...	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I've noticed I'm hungry all the time now. I am not overweight or anywhere close to it. I weigh about 108 lbs; in my teen years; female; i eat very healthy; but lately I'm hungry no matter what. I'll eat breakfast around 6:15; then around 10 I eat a snack. I eat lunch; then right after i got hungry. When I get home; I eat another snack; then dinner. About an hour after dinner; I eat another snack until I go to bed. I am not gaining any weight; but I was just wondering why I could be hungry all the time.	2006	2006	13	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I quit drinking pop; unless it is diet. I stopped drinking coffee and only drink tea (with like 2 sugar cubes and a small amount of lite half and half). I drink 1-2 bottles of water a day (this is up from none). I do not eat after supper (supper is usually at 7ish); and I used to eat all kinds of snacks right up until bedtime. I have been doing these things for (the pop one is about a year); a few months. I have also included light exersize at work; and making sure I get up and out of chair at least once per hour at work. As well as using my wii fit and other wii games at home and trying to sleep more regular hours; and eating a low fat high fibre breakfast (I never used to eat breakfast - but would start snacking around 9am until lunch)... and I have not only not lost any stinking weight; but I have gained a few more pounds. Short of starving myself or making myself vomit after each and every meal (and not sure either of those would work at this point either); I do not know what to do. I have in the long ago past been a smoker; and also had bouts of eating disorders (both anerexia and bulemia) of which I am not proud; but the past is the past. I had a gallbladder removal surgery about 8 years ago; and at the time my liver had started to fail. I currently have fatty liver disease (of which the doctor said was nothing serious; and they do nothing for it - but I read about different enzymes to take to help with digestion; and I take them although not faithfully as they are expensive); so now I have to wonder why am I losing nothing???? Anybody have any other doable idea's; I do not want to spend a crap load of money and continue getting the same results I have been getting. I am about to start the master cleanse; in a few days... I am a little worried about doing that while working and caring for 4 very busy children; from 17 to 5. However I am determined to get back into shape; I am tired of being OBESE... it *****.	2009	2009	34	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am a 37 year old male. 2 1/2 years ago I started getting these symptoms. It felt like a Head cold. Felt like wet forehead (inside). Couldn't concentrate; sometimes confused low ambition; poor memory; cranky. Lose track of what I was doing. Gazing alot. Ears slightly blocked; tingling in different parts of my head. Just like a head cold. Here is my problem!!! It has never left!! I was convinced it was a head cold because of the blocked ears wet tingling sensations etc... So I went to doctor; he thought it was anxiety or stress induced. Changes in my life; new business etc.. So he prescribed celexa. I am no longer cranky; more calm; but other symptoms are still here. Then 1 year ago was my worst year. Could hardly work. Tired constantly;eyesight blurry. Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. So I take metformin. 500mg 2times a day. Symptoms are still here. I seem to need about 10 hours sleep. I take Unisom to sleep. So I am left with the original symptoms; forgetfulness; ears slightly blocked can't focus on work. Can I run new business again? Scared. Is it nervous system; or immune system? It really feels like a head cold I never got healed from. Is there fluid in my head that won't go away? I feel disabled. I am only 37 and want to start getting healthy but have no motivation. I am 195lbs 5.5 height. I got bells palsy also 4 years ago. It left within 3 months. Please help.	2007	2007	37	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Just FYI - if you have IR you might want to also keep on top of this one too. Better safe than sorry....I don't want to be the harbinger of doom but I know IR is a problem for some folks around here. I hate HCC if you can't tell.....no more of my friends should die of this. -------------------------------------- Higher HCC risk with increased insulin resistance in hepatitis C patients May 12; 2010 Recent studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Insulin resistance (IR); which correlates inversely with circulating adiponectin concentration; is a consistent finding in patients with type 2 DM. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported to be associated with increased IR. Recent studies suggest that IR plays a crucial role in fibrosis progression; and has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on treatment responses to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A research article to be published on May 14; 2010 in the World Journal of Gastroenterology addresses this question. The research team led by Dr. Hung from Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital prospectively investigated the IR assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) and serum adiponectin level in two independent cohorts of consecutive newly diagnosed HCC patients and those with different clinical stages of chronic HCV infection. Among 165 HCC patients; type 2 DM was more prevalent in HCV subjects compared to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or non-HBV; non-HCV cases. HOMA-IR was higher in HCC patients with HCV than in those with HBV infection. In 188 patients with chronic hepatitis C; HCC subjects had higher blood sugar; insulin level and HOMA-IR than those with chronic hepatitis and advanced fibrosis. Based on stepwise logistic regression analysis; HOMA-IR was one of the independent factors associated with HCC development. This result was similar even if the diabetic subjects were excluded for analysis. The research team concluded that increased IR; regardless of the presence of diabetes; is significantly associated with HCC development in patients with chronic HCV infection. These findings may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in the management of chronic HCV-infected patients. Since IR is a potentially modifiable factor; therapeutic intervention aimed at decreasing IR may be warranted in these patients.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; Before I was diagnosed with my prolactin producing pituitary tumor; hasimotos; diabetes and high blood pressure (just to name a few) I was experiencing middle of the night nausea; very similar to morning sickness. After a few weeks of treatment with Dostinex for the tumor my prolactin levels went back to normal and my middle of the night nausea stopped. It has since resumed and it wakes me up... often I even incorporate how I feel into my dreams before I wake up. Anyone else with this problem? Could my prolactin have spiked again; even though I am still on Dostinex? Something else maybe? Thanks; Sarah	2008	2009	30	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	This tint of green-overall not blotches; has happened before in the past a few times. My vision is not deteriorating; but I'm trying to link it up to something in my diet (or lack of). It occurs immediately upon awakening; but only lasts a few seconds; then everything is normal. I'm 50 y/o woman with no health problems (thyroid exception). My BP is usually normal between 120 -130 but can spike shortly a bit higher. I take no BP meds. Could it be a spike in BP? I had some unusually salty food last night. Or could it be something else?	2012	2012	51	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Some in the community have expressed interest in having a weekly weigh in again; in order to help keep each other accountable and maybe motivated. I realize that not everyone weighs on Sunday; but that's okay. You can weigh whatever day you choose; then just enter it on Sunday; or if you weigh on Mon; just wait till Mon to post on the thread. Here we go....... I haven't been doing real well lately; even though I've really been giving it my best shot. Most of you don't know me; so here's a little bit about myself. I'm retired; have had hypothyroidism since 2007 and have recently been diagnosed with pre-diabetes/metabolic syndrome. This means that my body does not use insulin properly; so it shuttles whatever I eat; directly to fat cells. Over the past 3 months; I've actually gained approximately 8 pounds and nothing I do seems to be getting rid of it; even though I'm working with my doctor's office in an effort to maintain diet and exercise. I need to lose a total of about 25 pounds; but for now; I'm setting my goal smaller than that. I'll be happy to lose 15 pounds; then I can go on and try to lose the rest. Now; it's your turn; tell us something about yourself and your goals; if you like and let us know how we might be able to help you reach your goal(s).	2008	2013	63	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar; Major Depression; Panic Attacks; and Paranoia several years ago. I am on alot of meds right now. I am on Depakote 500mg x 2 @bedtime; Gabapentin 100 mg x 2 capsules 3 times a day; Lunesta 3mg for sleep @ night; Clonazepam 0.5mg 3 x a day; Lexapro 20mg x 2 @ bedtime; and Budeprion 150mg every am. I went to my Psychiatrist yesterday and because I stay depressed she was going to take me off the Lexapro but did not. She did not take me off of it but did say if I come back next month as depressed she was going to take me off of it because she did not think it was helping. She did mention putting back on an anti-depressant in place of it. Therefore; I am confused on all this. Just wondering if anyone has a comment on all this. I have tried alot of meds. If anyone could help I would certainly appreciate it. God Bless.... Pam	2008	2008	46	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"A few days ago I was sitting reading and watching tv when I felt this strange sensation of moderate uncomfortableness/mild pain in the right top of my head. It was enough to make me flinch and be concerned but there was no severe pain. It seemed to me like it might be located under the scalp vs deep inside my head. The sensation seemed to be two separate but closely parallel pulsating streaks like lightening. This lasted only a few seconds then went away. I didn't have a headache; didn't notice any faintness; dizzyness; weakness or change in vision that I could tell. The next day I noticed a steady mild discomfort seemed to be present in my scalp/head alongside the temple just in front of my right ear. My ear seemed to feel some discomfort in it; almost as if I was getting an earache (which I didn't really get) and a feeling of fullness; this feeling also continued on behind the lower point of the jaw joint and down into my neck; like where one might feel discomfort from a swollen gland. Today this sensation still exists and the skin of my face on the right in this same general area feels just ever so slightly numb and tingly; like the very beginning sensation you start to get after receiving a novacane shot. If I turn my head far to the right I can feel the uncomfortable feeling near my temple/ear and neck more. I also have some mild pain if I press moderately hard on the spot on my head that originally had the ""lightning like"" flashes of discomfort. The same is said if I press on the areas where I feel the discomfort along the temple/ear/neck. Could this be caused by some sort of plaque breaking loose and traveling through an auricular vein? I have not seen the doctor for this yet. I have an appointment on the 18th this month for my 6 month check up for Diabetes type 2; at my last check I was found to now be in the ""prediabetic"" range. I am taking Metformin 500 mg once a day; and Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25 once a day for hypertension. My blood pressure has been in the nornal to high normal range but lately I have been under a lot of stress. I am 41; 5'7"" and 305 lbs. I plan on talking to the doctor about this head thing at my appointment but am wanting answers now incase I should try to get in sooner."	2011	2011	41	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I came across this site trying to gather information on what has been happening to my face. I have always suffered from acne; yet in the past years it has gotten out of control (i am 27). I do not have cysts regularly; but my face is cluttered with numerous small acne bumps; most hidding little very thick hairs beneath them and puss. I know my acne is rooted from facial hair. I try to pluck them and I get acne when they begin to grow back; and ingrown hairs. I try to get the ingrown hairs out and it results in wounds and scaring. I really do not know what to do at this point. I tried laser; yet after the first session my face got out of control. I believe it must have happened when they first shaved my face (standard procedure for laser hair removal)- yet the shaving opened all the little acne bumps and must have allowed it to spread. Someone mentioned diabetes and menstral cycle problems. I have very irregular periods and have been diagnosed with "" PCOS "" (a pre-diabetic stage). I know my facial hair is rooted to this problem; yet I do not know how to fix it. If others reading this have facial hair; acne; and gain wegiht easily (even if you are not overweight; yet it is hard for you to maintain a stable weight across the year) ; then I would get tested for PCOS. I have acne; thick facial hair around both my cheecks leading from my mouth to my side burns; and across the jawline and chin. I am not what you would call overweight; although I could loose 10 pounds; but as a child I was. I know what is causing my horrible acne; yet no one (and believe me I have been to MANY doctors) has given me any solutions. I have tried birth control; topical/oral treatments for acne; laser hair removal; anything and everything (at one point rubbing pure aloe vera on my face); yet NOTHING has worked. These things have controlled the situation; until the new batch of hairs grow; I remove them (because I feel very uncomfortable with them); and then when they start growing back its the same process of acne; etc.. all over again. Can anyone relate to this? any reccomendations? treatments? I don't know what is worst; a face full of acne or a face full of hair as a female... or worst; a face with BOTH and the scars from having it happen over and over again (my current situation). HELP! This discussion is related to Facial Cysts with Ingrown Hair."	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	things your mama never told you..... Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat. Effects on hepatocyte fine structure.Flaks B; Flaks A; Shaw AP. Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level; 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver; a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration; the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups; and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. However; significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally; 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium; which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.	2007	2009	57	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have a question about my recent heart cath. I was told I had no blockages just that my right coronary artery is very small and gets narrower the further down it goes. I don't know what that means and unfortunately I was very drowsy when the dr came in to tell me this as the sedated me for the cath. All I know is my Verapamil was increased to 240 mg and my Crestor was increased to 40 mg. Is this a normal finding or a potential problem? I think everything is ok as I was told that I'm just one of those women who have chest pain for no identifiable cause and all I need to do is follow up w/ my PCP. If it makes a difference I went to dr for chest pressure; sob and nausea. Hx of htn; high chol (398 the day befor cath); endothelial dysfunction. Strong family hx of early heart disease- mother died of MI age 59; father died of MI age 60; brother has CAD; CHF and had stent placed at age 35.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Greetings: My wife has been sick for about three months now and I am very concerned. Here is the sequence of events. 1) This summer she was in very good physical shape and feeling great. Due to ongoing PMS problems ( worse in the last 5 years ); she decided to see a Doctor specializing in this problem. This doctor is a strong believer in natural treatments. 2) The doctor placed her on natural progesterone cream and a whole series of vitamin suplements in August. This cause heavy bleeding in the second month. This has gone away. 3) My wife developed sinusitis in late september and had a bad time getting rid of it. She took one antibiotic and it worked but she stopped taking it too early and got the sinusitis back. She took a full course of another antibiotic and then a full course of a third antibiotic before she finally put this at bay; although I am not completely sure it is all gone even now. 4) During this time of sickness; the doctor said her thyroid levels were wrong and started her on a natural thyroid suplement. There is also talk of antibodies being too high and the term hypothyroidism used. She has been off work for 5 weeks; went back to work for one week; then has taken two more weeks off; and now still feels poorly and does not feel she can go back to work at this time. She is constantly week; has constant yeast infections; and is tired and sleepy. Here weight has been stable through all of this. CONTINUED .......	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am 23yo and my husband and I got married in June of 2007. However we will have dated for 8 years in April this year....yes high school sweethearts :) My entire life I have had irregular periods. When I was younger I had extremely heavy flows and painful cysts on my ovaries. They put me on birth control when I was 15 or 16 to regulate my periods which helped emensly. I didnt miss a day of school after being on the pill due to my horrific periods. I went off the pill this past october and we have been trying to conceive since then. However I hadn't gotten my period until now since Christmas. It makes it kind of difficult to get pregnant huh?! :( So I went in to an OB dr. and he did some tests and he said my testosterone levels are slightly elevated and I might have PCOS. Ok; now at least I have a reason why we can't get pregnant and there are no periods. So he prescribed Provera and clomid to help us out. I took the pill for 10 days and on the 11th day i got my period which would be considered day 1 which was Saturday. So i started my clomid on monday (day 3) and will take it through day 5 (friday). My period started off kinda light but now it is in full force! Last night which yesterday morning was the first day i took clomid I got severly dizzy and lightheaded in the evening. I had to immediately sit down and couldn't open my eyes b/c everything was spinning. IS THIS NORMAL? I went to bed and woke up for work and felt dizzy all over again. I decided to stay home b/c I am an operating room nurse and it would be no good being dizzy and unable to function in a high stress environment like the OR. Will I get this dizzyness every day i take the clomid? Also; I go in to get blood drawn on day 21 to see if I've ovulated. Will that blood test also be able to tell if i'm pregnant at that point or is it too early? I'm so anxious and excited for day 21 to come. What are the chances I will get pregnant the first time around? My dr. gave me some tips to help the process and I've done them. I take a prenatal vitamin and have been since october with folic acid. I don't smoke; I don't drink; I limit my caffeine and I""m ""destressing"" my life. Any other thoughts. I hope you can shed some light on our situation."	2008	2008	23	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi there; put simply; my doctor suspects that the Vagus nerve has been damage during heart surgery last October. They believe this to be the case because I have been left with a high resting pulse rate. I also have a constant 'buzzing' nervous sensation across my chest and down my arms; that can get almost unbearable at times. I can feel my whole upper body trembling. Can someone tell me if this could also be due to the Vagus nerve damage? Also; do nerves really heal themselves or not? Can anyone recommend a herbal or vitamin remedy to help the healing process and / or to relieve me of the 'buzzing'? I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you.	2012	2012	36	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"OK. I went to this VERY nice Doctor in Anchorage. At first she let me know that she ""THOUGHT"" I had bad posture; was overweight and had carpal tunnel which was what was causing my pain - but that she was going to run some tests. I went back to the hotel thinking --- woohoooooo! I can lose 25 lbs --- I'll be a slimmer me... I'll sit up straight --- and I'll get those gellie keyboard thingies... Wooohooooo! I CAN FIX THIS.... Well - she ruled out Rheumatoid Arthritis --- and she ruled out carpal tunnel... (I noticed she didn't rule out the overweight stuff.... Sigh... Ah well... darn...) It kind of left me in a slump - because I'm feeling horrible pains... Anyhow - after much (MUCH MUCH MUCH) testing --- and still waiting on more bloodwork to rule out all other AutoImmune Disorders - she's determined that it's all in my head... Whoa --- what?????? LMAO! OK - it's not in my head... It's in my cells to be more precise. Neurons; methinks is the exact word. Anyhow --- something either VERY MUCH like Fibromyalgia - Neuropathic Pain receptor distribution.... Kinda like a car that emits too many sparks from it's plugs... That my pain receptors are on Maximum overdrive. This is all a ""preliminary diagnosis"" at this point (as we all know things are always ""up in the air"" in the medical industry) and that I am waiting on more blood tests and some other results. She prescribed Lyrica and Cymbalta... (Lyrica is a pain receptor ""blocker"" and Cymbalta is an antidepressant that ALSO assists with the receptor blocking --- but on the serotonin level... I'm not depressed; thank goodness; but she said the combination of the 2 seemed to work the best for her other patients... but that each person is different...) Now ---- I haven't taken them yet - I'm waiting until tonight or so to see if they make me too drowsy. I'm not too certain of these drugs - but she did check for HEPATIC problems with it. So far; none that she could find. Anyhow; I'm to call her if these don't work in a couple of weeks. And she'll call me if there are any other problems. I'm a bit confused - because I'm not sure why I should be feeling neuropathic pain that ""doesn't"" exist... But she tried to explain it like this: Person ""A"" stubs toe --- feels pain at level ""1"" I stub toe and I'm ready to be shot to be put out of my misery. LMAO! That's about right - I'm definitely more sensitive to pain than your average person... but your typical aches and pains? Weird... So if I get a sore shoulder from sitting too long in one position --- to me that translates to ""AN ELEPHANT HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY SHOULDERS"". Now -- the interesting thing here is that I think HCV individuals are more likely to have Neuropathic pain than your average person. So --- with that in mind - methinks Fibromyalgia is coming up to my diagnosis plate pretty soon. Well - at least I'm not dying at the moment -- there's always something to be thankful for!!!! LOL! Hugs to y'all... I just wanted everyone to know what was happening --- cause heck it was an interesting trip. Now --- questions... ANYONE know ANYTHING about LYRICA or CYMBALTA ---- good or bad? Have a splendid day folks! Meki"	2007	2008	41	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	After 2 ER visits; 1 Urgent care visit and 7 visits with 3 doctors. I had zero resolve to why my feet were like blocks of ice and I was shivering; trembling; dizzy and constantly feeling like I was going to pass out. Body temp of 95. This started January 10th and by the time March rolled around; I could not even lift myself out of my bed; I was so weak. When they had no answers; they prescribed one antibiotic after the other. So in the course of 3 months I was given 5 different antibiotics. I told them I suspected my thyroid because years ago my health insurance actually allowed me to see a functional medicine practitioner and she had run labs on me; this was 2012 and she said I believe you are having trouble with your thyroid. She prescribed Nature throid and I filled the script and one week later; I was laid off from work. I did not take the medication as I did not have any one to guide me through it. When I began working again and was covered on a new health insurance plan I went to my primary physician ( the new insurance would not cover any visits to the functional medicine Dr) and I told him that my previous physician thought I had a thyroid problem. He ran the usual TSH and free T4 and said; nope you are fine. Fast forward to March 2017. I know I'm new here and you don't know me; but I am far from a drama queen. I am not over exaggerating when I say I truly believed I was dying. I've never been so weak in my life. I could barely breathe; I was so weak and so cold. I had zero strength. I live alone with no family so it was very frightening. I kept picturing the evening news announcing that a 54 yr old woman was found 5 days after she died alone in her home.; clutching a basal thermometer in her hands. Each day was getting worse and I was missing a ton of work. Finally bit the bullet and made the appt for the Dr. I had seen back in 2012; paying out of pocket. The appt was 03/15. For 4 days I could not even move from the futon. Out of shear desperation on 03/14 I took out that script I filled 5 years prior and I took 1/2 grain ( 1 pill) of that Nature throid she had prescribed me. Within 2 hours I could stand; 5 hrs later my body temp slowly started rising. I was not even close to well; but that little experiment told me my body needed whatever was in that tiny pill. Saw the Dr the next day and she gave me a new script for WP Thyroid and started me on 1/2 grain and told me to raise by 1/4 grain every 3 to 4 days to tolerance. On 04/03 I reached the 1.5 grain mark. Below are my lab results taken 03/15/17. Then taken 6 weeks later on 04/26/16 to reflect numbers while on a low dose of thyroid medication. In that 6 wks I have researched everything under the sun about all of this and tried to plan my course of action. I have multiple medical issues; type 2 diabetes; kidney stones; fatty liver; was tested back in 2014 for Cushings due to swollen adrenal glands found during my pap smear. Tests did not indicate Cushings per the endo. Who knows. I've been well aware of the major inflammation due to high C Reactive tests. Seems it's pretty standard for us Syndrome X patients to have most of these issues. I've tested vitamin levels; female hormones; saliva cortisol. None are normal. When I posted my first set of labs to the STTM ( stop the thyroid madness) facebook page. They told me I should not be on any medication. They said my thyroid showed it was working and until all the other issues are resolved I should not be on any medication. They said it would kill my thyroid. I was so upset because without that medication I could not have returned to work. I don't have the luxury of staying home and healing adrenals as was suggested. I did contact my doctor and ask her if I was destroying my own thyroid by being medicated; she said she had never heard or read that. I had to take the chance. I need to know what my goal is after these results. Continue on low dose NDT and add T3 as I work on getting vitamins; liver; adrenals; sleep etc resolved? I am stable; but not well. Not looking to feel like wonder woman; but need to feel stronger. I have an appt scheduled next week to meet the Dr and I need to know if I ask for an increase in NDT or to add T3? She is the only Dr here in town that will prescribe these medications and I think she is expecting me to guide her some as to the STTM protocol although I'm not sure that is hand's down the authority on this. I've found more useful information in this forum; then I have found there. I apologize for the length of this. My labs are posted below with ranges. 03/15/17 ( Before Meds) TSH 1.370 Range 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL free T3 3.5 Range 2.0-4.4 pg/mL free T4 1.30 Range 0.82-1.77 ng/dL RT3 21.5 Range 9.2-24.1 ng/dL TPO 13 Range 0-34 Thyroglobin AB <1.0 Range 0.0 to 0.09 Lab results 04/26/17 ( after 6 wks on low dose NDT) Ranges are same as listed above TSH = 0.815 free T3 = 3.0 free T4= 1.01 RT3 = 16.4 TPO= 13 Thyroglobulin AB <1.0	2017	2017	54	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 25 year old female; weighing 240 lbs. I went to the hospital last week with my asthma and they said ended taking my blood sugar because the sugar strip for my pregancy test turned brown. My blood sugar was 541. They kept me for both my asthma and the blood sugar; and ran some tests. my a1c was 7.7 which i am told is very high. They diagnosed me with type 2 diabetes. They think if i loose weight i might not need medication in the end. They sent me home on metformin and glypuride. Question 1: we splurged and had chinese food the other night at a buffet (but i still watched what I ate) I took my medication like i was supposed to and then went to walmart. We were at the buffet for at least an hour; so it was about an hour after i ate when we were walking around walmart i became very pale; felt really light headed; and very sick to my stomach. I thought maybe i ate to much; I took my blood sugar and it had dropped to 60. It was 126 before dinner. So what happened? I am so confused. Question 2: I feel kinda lost about the ranges I should be at. They said when I get up in the morning it should be between 70 and 120. Pre-meal (which is when I am supposed to test) should be 130 and under and if i ever test after a meal (2 hours) it should be 180 and under. Then they said to be careful it doesn't get to low. what is considered low. I know 60 is. Question 3: This kinda go with the last question. last night i took the wrong bus and ended up acouple a towns up from where I live. I ended waiting at the police department waiting for a ride home. I started feeling really light headed; and i had a fast heart beat. I thought maybe my blood sugar was getting low again since the last time i ate was at 2 and at this point it was 9 pm. When I checked my blood sugar it read 102; which i didn't think was low... any ideas on what was going on? Question 4: Last question; I promise. I just want to make sure my numbers are looking okay cause like I said; Im confused.all numbers are pre-meal unless stated otherwise. Friday 10- @7:41 am: 60 @6:34 pm: 166 (2 days after the hospital last day on stariods for asthma) Sat. 11- @7:58 am: 56 @9:35 pm: 136 Sun 12- @7:05 am: 72 @10 pm: 113 Mon 13- @7:45 am: 49 @4:09 pm: 105 @9:47 pm: 80 Tues 14- @7:22 am 87 @5:55 pm: 126 (this was the night it dropped to 60 around 7 pm) Wed 15- @7:24 am 81 @7:23 pm: 129 (stopped taking glypuride thought it could be the cause of drops) Thurs 16- @7:45 am: 86 @9 pm: 102 This morning at 7:50: 104 I appreciate any help and I am sorry for asking so many questions. I was gave as many details as possible cause I saw thats what someone suggested. Thanks again.	2010	2010	24	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am type 2 diabeteic patient. Due to skipping meal; I developed adrenaline stress and by diamicron metformin But blood sugar was never high. Doctor gave me Lantus and Humalog. It was working well for a year. Then blood was becoming high; Doctor gave me LEVEMIR. If I take 10 units of humalog; after two hours sugar drops 4 points; I think this is the right dose for humalog for what I eat. I eat 60 gram Carb every meal. But 3 hours; sugar tries to go low; but insead; it bounces back and proceede to values and I start to feel hypo; though I never see sugar 9. It is not hypo value; why sugar bounces up; why feel shaky; fear etc. I use LEVIMIR as base insulin. Why body is obstructing sugar to low; and why it gives hypo feeling. Can any body me the reason and how to overcome this situation? My sugar is going high now. MATIN	2009	2013

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm 38 years old; female; with IBS (constipation) and chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia. I also have Type 2 Diabetes which is very well under control (a1c has been 6.0 or below for the last couple of years). I have high cholesterol which is now under control with simvastatin and lopid. I take Lyrica for Fibro and Metformin for diabetes. I take acidophilus; fiber (Benefiber); and stool softeners with laxatives every single day for my constipation. (my other meds are: flexeril due to chronic very tense muscles in my upper back; shoulders; and neck; meclizine for vertigo; requip for restless leg syndrome; Imitrex for migraines; ativan for anxiety and luvox for OCD/skin picking. I was on amitriptiline for headaches but stopped that a few days ago to limit exacerbation of constipation. I also have asthma but don't have very much trouble with it... i have a Pro-Air inhaler if needed) A few months ago (in April); I started having severe abdominal pain. Through April; May; and until early June; I went to the emergency room 4 or 5 times due to severe pain. Towards the end of things; the pain was a level 9+. Well; I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome with constipation. I also have chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia and several other conditions (including plantar fasciitis and bursitis and severe lower back pain). My Fibromyalgia doctor prescribed Vicodin for me to use for my pain. Well; unbeknownst to me; Vicodin compounds constipation. I started having severe abdominal pain and so I would take more vicodin. It would ease the pain until it wore off; then it would come right back and I'd take vicodin again. This would last about 10 to 14 days until even the vicodin couldn't ease my pain and I'd have to go to the E.R. I would get a diagnosis of constipation; be given an enema and magnesium citrate and sent home. I was stubborn and wouldn't believe that constipation could cause such extreme pain so I kept using the vicodin and consequently kept ending up back in the E.R. Finally; after my June 10th visit to the E.R.; I grew a brain and stopped using the vicodin. I started taking Acidophilus; Benefiber; and Stool Softeners with Laxatives every day. Because I didn't have anything for the pain; I went through HORRIBLE pain for about 6 days before the pain finally eased. I continue to take the meds for constipation every day and my tummy doesn't feel nearly as bloated or full and I'm a little more regular than I was. Here's the thing; when I was going to the E.R. all those times; I had some general all over pain; but the MAJORITY of my pain was in my upper abdomen... like between my ribs in that place where you'd get the wind knocked out of you or someone would do the heimlich... in that area or just below it. Pushing on that place hurts... and I've discovered that pushing on the upper right area hurts too. Where the constipation pain seems to be mostly gone; this upper abdominal pain continues; though it's more moderate than severe. Over the past several years; I've had slightly elevated liver enzymes on and off. Testing showed nothing wrong with my liver so because I'm obese (around 225 lbs... down from 260 lbs the end of last year); she said it was probably just ""fatty liver"". Well; one of the times I was in the E.R. (back in April); my blood test for my pancreas levels came back a little elevated. They admitted me to the hospital just in case it was pancreatitis and did an ultrasound which came back negative. I've had ultrasounds a couple of times on my gallbladder and no stones were found. I have looked all over the internet for the past couple of months trying to find something that was close enough to my symptoms but didn't find anything. Well today I found something called ""Sphincter of Oddi""... which an online doctor mentioned a month ago but I didn't know what it was and thought it was just a typo or difficulty with English. Well; it turns out that I have several symptoms that track with SOD. Here's a list: -- pain is (postprandial?) worse after eating (seems to ease during times of clear liquid diet) -- consistent pain and tenderness in upper abdomen; middle and to the right. -- have had occasional slightly elevated liver enzymes -- have had one blood test return a mildly elevated pancreatic level -- ultrasound for gallstones negative -- return of acid reflux (approx 3 mos ago) after being ""cured"" approx 5 or 6 years ago after a period of taking Cimetidine -- daily mild to moderate nausea that strongly interferes with my eating habits (I usually only eat once a day due to nausea)... have lost around 30 lbs or more since the end of last year (Nov/Dec 2008) with no change in activity level... just lack of eating regularly. -- Only 1 episode of vomiting. Woke up one morning; sat up on the bed for a few minutes; then started vomiting. But I've had MANY episodes of very overwhelming nausea; however I have a very strong control of my gag reflex... can stick my fingers WAY down my throat and not even begin to gag. So I don't know if that's why I haven't been vomiting. -- very tired; can't get enough sleep So I'm wondering could it be SOD? Obviously it's not a severe case... my pain lately is mild to moderate; but pretty much constant every day. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions or questions? If you need more info; just ask. I don't get offended and am not easily embarrassed. I'm an open-book. I just want some ideas. I've had abdominal problems since I was a pre-teen... I used to have problems with gas getting locked up inside and couldn't release it and it caused excruciating pain. Those phases would last for HOURS; and usually happened at night. That lasted til I was in my mid 20's. My primary doctor is now finally trying to get me in to a GI doctor; but apparently there's only 1 in this area so he's booked I guess. Thanks for reading my long; novel-sized post. =) Holly"	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am white; and I have dark skin discoloration under my arms and in the vaginal area. It is embarrassing to me to even go to the doctor to ask about it because it looks ""dirty"". Is there any way that I can fix this problem or is it normal?"	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I wanted to know if anyone else with fibro has pain in their feet. I have severe pain in my feet which is brought on by walking. Can't walk too long before it sets in. Was told it was plantar fascitis. Went to a podiatrist who said it was tarsal tunnel. Went to orthopedic surgeon who said it wasn't that. He did x-rays; an MRI and nerve tests and all showed NOTHING! He said there seemed to be nothing wrong and couldn't help. Just wondering if in some way it could be connected to my fibro.	2010	2010	41	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Okie-Dokie; It took me 6 months to get this together; but I've finally got the 2nd round of Tx going again. Here is a brief overview of round 1: 51 year old Caucasian male Genotype 1a Grade 2; stage 3/4 254 lbs Diabetes M. type 2 Dx with HCV 12/04 Treated with Pegasys/ Copegus total 56 weeks; from 2/05 through 3/06. Slow viral response at 12 week assay; so increased riba from assigned 1200 mg/day to 1800 mg/day. Became undetectable to <50 IU by week 20. Relapsed within 30 days post Tx. I started round 2 on 9/15/06 with Peg-Intron 0.50 mL/150 mcg/week; and ribavirin 2000 mg/day. For the first three injections; I've been drawing up the entire contents of the IFN vial; after reconstituting with 0.70 mL of the supplied diluent. This has given me an extrapolated dosage of 202 mcg Peg-Intron/week; based on a 0.68 mL injection. Although this IFN dosage isn't officially sanctioned by my new doctor; I have an appointment this Tuesday; and I'll disclose at that time. My three-week labs should be available for review by then; and hopefully will show some positive trends; if not; there's always dose reduction... :-). Subjectively; I feel fine after three injections; no side effects have shown themselves yet; however this is still *way* early in the game. Last treatment; I was good until week 9 or 10 before this cr@p started creeping up on me; so I guess time will tell the story. It's probably worth mentioning that I've made some changes regarding exercise and diet as well. As a diabetic; it's important that I maintain tight blood glucose control- particularly while on treatment. Over the last six months; I've managed to lose approx. 50 lbs; walking 8 miles daily in the hills here along with removing most processed foods as well as meats (salmon only now!) from my meals has been really helpful. More and more evidence is suggesting that obesity and insulin resistance are both negative prognostic indicators for SVR; so we'll see if this has any effect in the long run. I don't expect to be posting very actively; however that just might change if these meds begin slowing me down. Until then; I'm trying to stay as active as possible. I think attitude is an effective tool for Sx; during my last treatment; I resigned myself to the fact that I'd get sick from these meds. This time; I'm going to keep going until I get Gumby-Legs and can't walk... In other words; if the side-effects knock the door off the hinges; I guess they're coming in; however; I'm not going to wait around for them. My very best to all those folks that I recognize from days past; in addition to a whole lot of new ones as well. Keep plugging away at this stuff; and we'll eventually prevail-- Bill	2005	2006	51	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Impact of Obesity on Hepatitis C and Treatment of HCV By Liz Highleyman It is increasingly clear that obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities play a role in the progression of liver disease and poor response to hepatitis C treatment. Obesity and the metabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions including insulin resistance and elevated blood fat levels -- is associated with steatosis (fatty liver); which in turn is linked with more severe liver fibrosis and a greater risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As reported in the May 2006 issue of Gastroenterology; for example; a meta-analysis of data from more than 3;000 patients at 10 clinics in Italy; Switzerland; France; Australia; and the United States found that steatosis was ""significantly and independently"" associated with fibrosis in people with chronic HCV infection; and that addressing metabolic factors ""appears important in the management of chronic hepatitis C."" Similarly; a study presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2006 conference in May confirmed the link between steatosis and liver disease progression. In a retrospective review of medical records from 223 chronic hepatitis C patients; researchers observed a significant relationship between steatosis and fibrosis; leading them to suggest that; ""Efforts to control steatosis may therefore have an important role in halting HCV liver disease progression; particularly in persons who are non-responders to antiviral therapy."" How Do Obesity and Metabolic Factors Promote Liver Damage? The mechanisms by which obesity and metabolic abnormalities promote steatosis and fibrosis are not well understood; but inflammation; autoimmunity; and altered levels of cytokines and hormones such as leptin and adiponectin may play a role. A study reported in the April 2006 Journal of Hepatology showed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels -- and whether ALT decreased with successful treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin -- were associated with markers of the metabolic syndrome; including high body mass index and elevated blood pressure; blood glucose; and blood fat levels. The authors concluded that ALT elevation (a marker for liver inflammation) ""partially depends on the degree of derangement of fat and carbohydrate metabolism."" In the June 2006 issue of Hepatology; researchers from the Mayo Clinic reviewed mechanisms that may explain the link between obesity and liver disease progression. Fat tissue secretes hormones called adipokines (including leptin and adiponectin) that regulate metabolism of glucose and lipids in the liver; and also modulate immune activity. Some adipokines promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Leptin appears to activate signaling pathways in hepatic stellate cells that contribute to inflammation and fibrogenesis. Obesity can cause insulin resistance; which promotes the accumulation of fat in liver cells; HCV; too; appears to directly induce insulin resistance; so obese patients with hepatitis C may have an additive effect. Oxidative stress related to inflammation; as well as elevated insulin levels; may interfere with interferon-signaling pathways. Finally; excess fat tissue reduces the amount of circulating interferon in the body during treatment; possibly due to impaired absorption after injection. Different HCV genotypes seem to be associated with steatosis through differing mechanisms. Genotype 3 HCV appears to directly promote the build-up of fat in liver cells; while steatosis in genotype 1 patients appears to be linked with co-existing metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance. Management of Obesity The Mayo Clinic researchers reported that reducing body weight and improving underlying metabolic factors may help ""overcome the low sustained viral response rates observed in obese patients infected with HCV."" The first-line approach to managing obesity involves lifestyle modification; including exercise and a healthy; balanced diet. Weight loss has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity; lower ALT levels; and improve liver histology. If such measures are not adequate; anti-diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glucophage); pioglitazone (Actos); and rosiglitazone (Avandia) may also be used to increase insulin sensitivity; which may help reduce fat accumulation in the liver. While these medications have not yet been studied extensively in people with hepatitis C; there is data suggesting that they are associated with reduced ALT and improved liver histology in HCV negative patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The authors also suggested that use of higher doses of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for extended periods might help overcome the lower response rates observed in obese patients. Weight-based dosing and longer treatment durations are currently the subject of considerable research; but the authors also suggested higher dosing based on levels of insulin resistance or amount of visceral fat; rather than body weight alone. Together; these studies suggest that liver disease progression should be considered among the deleterious outcomes of obesity and the metabolic syndrome; along with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 7/28/06 References G Leandro; A Mangia; J Hui; and others.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in Feb of 2004 as a result of being rushed to the emergency room in the middle of one night. I had awoken with incredible pain in my legs. The pain was the most horrible I had ever felt and having had problems with migraines in my youth; I knew what severe pain felt like. This was far worse. It was so bad; I was begging God to kill me. I'm going to shorten the story here because it is very long with all the details included. Besides the diabetes; I was also diagnosed with severe peripheral neuropathy. A checkup a year before showed no indication of diabetes. I had intermittent leg pain since my late teens that aspirin always took care of. Aspirin was of no help this time. Now jumping forward to 2008. Since shortly after being diagnosed I would experience periodic blackouts/pass outs/fall asleep or whatever you call them. These occur virtually every day; some days worse than others and they last for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes each. I have no clue when one happens. I just wake up and realize one occurred. Sometimes they come in strings; one right after another and there are most frequent when I have not slept well. I am only able to sleep 2 to 3 hours at a time; I then wake up and am wide awake. So; I usually end up taking about 3 naps each day rather than a normal 8 hours straight. They can occur anywhere. I have even had 2 episodes occur while standing in front of the toilet; taking a leak. My neurologist declared me permanently disabled in Feb of 2005. My illness has continued to worsen over the years to where I now have difficulty walking and am very unsteady on my feet. I have almost no feeling at all below the waist and everything below the knees is completely numb. I am now starting to have numbness and pain in my hands; particularly my pinkies. I have had muscles spasms almost since the time I was diagnosed. They were nothing extraordinary. However; in the last several months; I have starting to have what I call ""violent body spasms"". Almost every time I lay down to go to sleep; as soon as I start to drift off; one of the body spasms strikes. The ones that occur in bed happen either in my legs or the middle of my back. It feels like someone has kicked me in the back as hard as they can and it almost throws me out of the bed. When they occur in my legs; its like kicking a football; fast and hard. So hard that my legs kick out violently. These attacks also occur during the day. For example; I had one just before I started this message. While sitting here; both legs kicked out so hard; I was pushed backwards; away from the desk and it felt like a bolt of electricity had shot through both knees; causing a great deal of pain. I currently take 100mg of morphine twice a day and a 60 mg dose as a bridge in between; for the pain in my legs. I also take Lyrica; 150mg 3 times a day as well Citalopram at 40mg per day. I also take Glipizide and Metformin for the diabetes. These spasms concern me as they seem to be getting stronger and more violent. They aren't true body spasms as they only occur in specific places and have never actually occurred all over my body at once. They are very weird sometimes. I have raked everything off my desk when the spasm causes my arms to flail out wildly. I have actually slugged myself in the jaw on several occasions when the spasm occurred in my right arm. It wasn't an accident either. I have actually seen my hand come up; make a fist; and then hit me in the chin or jaw. It all happens so fast though that by the time my brain realizes what is going on; it is done. Its almost like I am possessed or something and someone else is directing my appendages. Does anyone have any idea what is going on with me?"	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I have suffered with chronic muscle pain; muscle knots and horrible fatigue on and off for 5 years. I have acid reflux; PCOS; hypothyroidism; insulin resistance; high cholesterol; chronic diarrhea/constipation....if it isn't one it is the other. I have trouble sleeping and many nights may only get 3-4 hrs of sleep; even with muscle relaxers. My primary physician believes I have fibromyalgia; he sent my to a rheumatologist. The rheumy did not even take a health history! I told him my symptoms which had recently worsened. I was experiencing spasms and twitching in my legs and feet; along with numbness. My toes have a bluish/purple cast to them and are ice cold year round. My knees have gotten to the point where going up stairs is difficult. The back of my knees hurt horribly when I sit with them bent at a 90* angle or when standing for extended periods of time. The only exam the rheumy did was to push on my stomach; he did not want to see my feet. I have PCOS and take a lot of meds. due to that condition. I gave him a med list and the first med listed was Metformin ....shouldn't his first question have been; ""Are you diabetic?"" especially with feet and legs going numb and poor circulation in my feet. I am at my wits end; I am depressed about my health; I am only 38 yrs old and the mother of 4 boys. Along with the fibro type symptoms; I have chronic kidney infections and have become allergic to macrobid and sulfa. Ibuprofen gives me NO relief; tylenol makes it dull down some. I feel like a hypochondriac...going to the dr.... tests show nothing...but my pain and fatigue never stop. Some days are much better than others; but none are close to pain free. I work as a hygienist 3 days a week....after 8 hrs sitting with my elbows up to my shoulders and making repetitive motions all day; well I am wiped out; in pain; depressed that there seems to be no help on the horizon. I am not a weak person; I carried twin boys to 38 wks ...spent 2 days in labor. I delivered 2 healthy boys with a combined weight of almost 15 lbs. That was 7 yrs ago...my boys deserve a mom who isn't sick all the time. The amount of time and money and missed work trying to get a diagnosis may lead to having to snger be able to keep pushing my body; taking care of everyone else first. ell my home; possibly my job (I am the only hygienist in my office) I went thru the same thing with PCOS...I researched and diagnosed myself after believing that something was wrong....and when they ran the correct test; bingo; I had a problem...it wasn't in my head. I don't have the energy to pursue this the way I did PCOS; and because I don't look sick; I am to suck it up and go along. I am lost..just lost. AJ"	2011	2011	38	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I went to the gyno for the first time in august and he did a regular exam but i also had itchiness and swelling. then he told me he was going to take a culture for herpes because i had a few cuts inside my vagina. I had had sex for the first time a few days before and it was very dry(im thinking what may have made the cuts). I few days later i got the test results back that i had a yeast infection and then i few days from them i found out that my herpes culture was negative. About 2 months after that i had the same symptoms itching and swelling and i had a 2 cuts at the top of my outlabia. almost in my public hair region. I went to a gyno at school and she told me that it didnt look like herpes at all and that i should be fine; it was just another yeast infection. the cuts were gone in less than a day. I dont know if it was because i was extra cautious and still thought i had herpes but i always feel like im irriated down there. i went home that weekend to my regular gyno and he told me i had nothing to worry about. About a month after the 2nd yeast infection i had another cut right where my pubic hair meets my outer labia.again went away in less than a day. and i have still been experiencing irriation it feels like. so my question is does anyone experience cuts with yeast infections. because my doctor said it was common. but i am still convinced i have herpes. and my boyfriend doesnt understand why i wont touch him anymore. i am going to get blood tested for herpes on thursday but i have a feeling my doctor is going to tell me its unnecessary.	2005	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I find myself getting really tired sometimes when I eat; I just feel horribly drained and can barely keep my eyes open; most times I can't fight it and end up taking a nap. It's getting to the point where some days I'm in bed more than I'm awake; which I know is obviously not good for me. I find it usually happens when I eat pasta or soup with crackers; so I'm guessing it's sugar/carbs related. I can't afford to cut these things out of my diet as I'm on unemployment right now and can barely afford pastas and soups as it is; I'd love to be able to eat lots of vegatables but I can't afford them and they don't last long enough even if I could. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening? It's getting to the point where I have to choose to either be starving all day or exausted all day. Does anyone have any tips they can lend me? Thanks; H	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I've joined this forum on behalf of my 56 y/o husband who has HCV which has progressed to stage 4 cirrhosis. He is developing other complications like splenomegaly and portal hypertension; etc. He attempted tx in '03 for 3 months and had to stop due to the stress of work (was a home builder) and the side effects. (developed diabetes shortly afterwards-I think the 2 are related) Anyway; he has genotype 1a and was responding to the Inf/Rib tx; but it was all just to much to handle at once. He was then a stage 2 cirrhosis so in 7-8 years; it has doubled. We have recently been discussing the standard tx with a Tyler TX doc. I came across the teleprevir a few years ago on the internet and then again the other day in a NY Times Magazine article from the summer. I emailed the California doc in the article and he said I needed to check into the trials at the Liver Institute at Methodist Dallas and also Parkland Hospital as the drug would not be available till summer 2011 and also get evaluated for transplantation. I did find a trial which seemed suitable and registered but am not sure what to do next. The Liver Institute seems to be looked upon favorably and I'm not impressed with the attention/concern from the Tyler; TX doc. Should have Medicare in January with a supp policy but won't have $ for all of the gaps! The California doc also mentioned a Dr. Ghalib in Arlington she used to work at Methodist. Things seem to be deteriorating faster than I expected and I really want a better shot at success than the 40-50% SVR that the standard INF/Rib offers. We were told that there is also a chance the tx could precipitate liver failure and with his advanced cirrhosis; that scares the shi$ out of me! Could really use some input from some of you who ""have the t-shirt"". I feel we've really wasted some critical time and had no idea things could progress this quickly. So any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated as I feel we are running out of time."	2010	2010	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. This is somewhat complicated. Sorry in advance. I am a 49 y.o. Hispanic Female; Obese; with Type 2 diabetes. I take metformin 1 gram bid; and an ARB for renoprotection. I have hypothyroidism; and I take Synthroid daily. I had a lap Chole in 2001. I am lactose intolerant. I have had diarrhea since 2001 on and off; esp. after a large or fatty meal; or after dairy product intake. Lots of mucus is present at times. I sometimes have mild and intermittent RUQ abdominal pain. Pain does not change with position change; but will be slightly worse after a meal. Pain does not radiate; but at times I have a feeling that can best be compared to having an inflated balloon under my rib cage in the back on the right. It's not pain...it just feels abnormal. No nausea; no vomiting; no jaundice; no weight loss. **No** constipation; ever. All non-diarrheal bowel movements are thin or ribbon like. I had 2 CT scans of the abdomen; an abdominal ultrasound; and an amylase (no lipase) a year and a half ago. All were normal. One month ago; I had an upper endoscopy; which noted GERD with esophageal erosions. I also had a colonoscopy; which noted a polyp; which was determined to be benign. Also; there was diverticulosis. No cultures or stool for O&P have been done. The gastroenterologist prescribed Colestid; and Librax; Aciphex and a fiber supplement. He also prescribed a low lactose/high fiber diet; and the usual lifestyle modifications for GERD. I am complying with my treatment. (Well; OK; I cheat sometimes and take lactase tablets before I have cheese.) The problem is: with all of this; I still have had no change. The GERD is somewhat better; but the diarrhea/thin/flat stools are still present. The abdominal pain is still present. I do not feel overly comfortable with my GI guy. I am really at my wit's end; to be putting my story here for the world to see. So please; if you can; give me some ideas. Thanks in advance.	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	So I already know that I have PCOS; but my mom and grandma both had severe endo! I have researched both conditions; but PCOS never talks about chronic pain before;during and after menstruating; and pain during and after intercourse. My bowels are very messed up and I get really bad pain in my rectum. That is where my mom had a lot of it. I have no idea. None of my docs will do laparascopy. I have only had one U/S and a very long sharp vaginal probe; I forget what that is called. My blood clots are gigantic and never ending. I need some input from you intelligent ladies!!! I have been on the pill for 8 days now and can feel my cysts filling and popping! So much relief afterwards though. Bethany	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with PCOS about two weeks ago. I've been plagued with hirsutism since I was 12 years old and I'm now 36 and I was always diagnosed with idiopathic hirsutism because my total testosterone was normal; my glucose was normal; my menstruation was very regular; I was not overweight; etc.; etc. I always believed that there was something wrong and my physicians just weren't savvy enough to figure it out. Years passed and I decided to get checked again because I've gained 30 lbs over two years (due to taking prednisone for the hives I got daily because of Hashimoto's) and the male pattern hair growth increased. I'm now 5'6"" and 167lbs. I sought the help of an endocrinologist and he ordered a lot of blood tests. I never had problems with elevated glucose and the test showed that my fasting glucose was 102; slightly elevated. My free testosterone was elevated also which explained the excessive hair on my chin; neck; chest; stomach and thighs. I haven't had problems with fertility because I have two children who were conceived with no difficulty because my periods had always been like clock work. I was surprised at the diagnosis but relieved to find out that there was a known medical term for my symptoms. I have very bad depression and panic attacks and I've had them for 18 years now. Does anyone know if there is a link between PCOS and clinical depression? Also; is there anyone else out there with Hashimoto's thyroiditis along with PCOS. I'm going crazy with depression; hirsuitism; pelvic pain; panic attacks; excess weight; slight acne; oily skin; fatigue; etc. If anyone has these symptoms please tell me what treatment you've sought and what has helped you if anything. Thanks and good luck."	2007	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello everyone; I hope all is well. I was just diagnosed with PCOS although I've had symptoms of it since I was 12 (hirsutism) and I am now 36. My hirsutism was diagnosed as idiopathic because the testing I had did not indicate an elevated testosterone level. I don't know if the testing is more sophisticated now but I had new testing done and it did indicate that my free weak testosterone was elevated. Anyway; I have a few hairs under my chin; a lot on my neck; chest; stomach; and inner thighs. I know...it's not attractive and very depressing. I pluck (which is not good for you and causes hyperpigmentation) and I shave. I've become very skilled at covering the hyperpigmentation up with concealer but I'm so tired of it. The plucking on my neck has caused so much hyperpigmentation that I have to conceal it or people would look at me and ask me; ""What's wrong with your neck?"" The skin on my chest also has hyperpigmentation and I only shave this area. I feel like a freak every time I shave my chest because I'm a woman and I'm a woman who loves makeup; clothes; fashion; shoes; etc. It just seems so wrong! If I wear low cut blouses I have to try to conceal the hyperpigmentation but it's difficult because the skin is not completely smooth and it looks like I've shaved so I'm always on the search for really nice big necklaces that would cover this part of my chest. It's difficult being me!! If anyone can relate to me send me a message and let me know your struggle or what you've done to help this problem. It was difficult for me to share this because although I know it has to do with having PCOS and I did not cause this to happen; it still is embarrassing. Also; I don't want to seem superficial or extremely vain because I do have other health concerns that are potentially much more damaging than the aesthetic ramifications of hirsutism but I just want to know if other African-American women are experiencing this because our skin is slightly different. Thanks."	2007	2009		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	This has been a kind of stressful weekend for me in part because of what was going on with me and also my friend Dave. This is also a kind of rant against the VA hospital here that both of us get our health care through. For those who don't know about my friend Dave he is my only friend here and his health is a lot worse than mine. Due to several hernias he gets intestinal blockages fairly often but usually waits too long before calling for an ambulance and usually requires emergency surgery to save his life. Friday he called me to say he was sick again and I was able to get him to let me call for an ambulance this time. It turns out that was probably the only good thing to happen all weekend. Normally it takes only about 15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive but for some reason they changed who covers where we live. As a result it took 45 minutes for them to arrive and I had to talk to the ambulance company to tell them how to find us. That sure doesn't bode well for us the live in this area. Dave later told me that the driver is a speed demon and it was the fastest trip he ever made to Columbia and that the paramedic in the back with him kept telling the driver to slow down. Once they got him stabilized at the hospital in Columbia that VA had them transfer him up to the VA hospital in Nashville and that is where the real nightmare started. By this time it had been over 12 hors since he had anything to eat or drink and being a diabetic he knew his Glucose was getting very low. He told the ER doctor about the diabetes but they would not give him anything because they were trying to decide if he would be needing surgery or not. Finally after several more hours they had decided that they would try to clear the blockage via medicines and enemas and not surgery so they transfered him to the ward. As so as he got there he told the nurse he was diabetic so they checked his glucose. It was so low he was almost to the point of going into a coma and he was really losing it mentally. They literally pours two glasses of sugar water down his throat and his glucose started to come back up. Once his mind was starting to work again they asked him why he hadn't told the ER he was diabetic. But of course he had! Then they came back into the room and pumped his stomach as they didn't know if he would need surgery or not. Next he had to fight with them over his diabetes again. They wanted to give him metformin which doesn't work and makes him violently ill instead of the insulin he has been on for about 6 months. They also refused to give him another of his regular medications because it is not on the formulary and was the weekend so they could not get approval for it. But he has a RX for this drug through the VA as it is the only drug that works for him. You would think that would be an automatic override on the formulary rules.! In the mean time I am taking care of his Lab Buddy while he is in the hospital as usual. Buddy is very dependent on Dave and gets depressed when he is not around. He doesn't eat or drink and the only way I can get him to eat is by playing catch with him a lot and bringing takeout food. When you are not use to playing catch with a dog it wears you out quickly and makes you sore. So I'm not sleeping very good due to pain. Sunday morning Dave calls me and says they are going to discharge him by noon so I head up to Nashville to pick him up. As my car is low on fuel I stop at a gas station to fill up. I end up standing there at the pump for 3 or 4 minutes because I can't remember how to get my gas tank lid open. You just push and it pops open but I don't remember that and am looking all over for a release. At this point I am beginning to think I should not make the drive as I had already stopped at a green light. My brain just is not functioning today. But how else is he going to get home so I head up to Nashville anyway. The rest of the trip up to Nashville was uneventful and no deer for me to see. Boo Hoo :( When I get to the hospital Dave tell me he is in a lot of pain and the thumb print system for dispensing pain meds at the VA is not working so no one is getting their pain medications. You would think they would have a key over ride so they can access the medication in case of system failure.! So Dave then asks the nurse how much longer until the paperwork for his release will be. He wants to get home as soon as he can so that he can take some of his pain medications. The nurse agrees with Dave that he was suppose to be released today but say the order isn't for today but tomorrow. Turns out that the nurse was thinking that today was the 7th instead of the 8th. Makes you wonder if the nurses are taking the pain medications themselves instead of giving them to patients for that kind of mistake. So instead of getting out of there by noon it was more like 1 before we left. The drive back home was murder on me. I had to stop to rest several times because my vision was getting very blurry; my legs were cramping up; and I was getting very sleepy. This makes the third time in a row that I have had a lot of trouble on the return drive from Nashville. I guess I should start looking for some other way to do my trips up there as each of the returns have been worse than the previous one. Well I guess that is about it for this grip session.

Not too happy about that b/c I was told I could still get pregnant after the swelling in the tubes go down. I have been having symptoms of Pregnancy the past couple of weeks. I had my last period on December 27; 2004. I know that I am not supposed to start until this weekend but I have been having all of the symptoms of being pregnant again. I have had nausea; sore breasts (very sore); they are extremely sensitive; and I have the dark blue lines on them like I did before.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Started my 5th therapy three weeks ago and feel 90% normal. Swim 12 lapse in the pool daily; great appetite; sleep eight hours and not angry. Could this be the answer? http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/12/AR2006091201444.html The Washington Post - Wednesday; September 13; 2006; Page A02 Marijuana can improve the effectiveness of drug therapy for hepatitis C; a potentially deadly viral infection that affects more than 3 million Americans; a study has found. The work adds to a growing literature supporting the notion that in some circumstances pot can offer medical benefits. Treatment for hepatitis C involves months of therapy with two powerful drugs; interferon and ribavirin; that have severe side effects; including extreme fatigue; nausea; muscle aches; loss of appetite and depression. Because of those side effects; many patients do not finish treatment and the virus ends up destroying their livers. Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco and at an Oakland substance abuse center tracked the progress of 71 hepatitis C patients taking the difficult therapy. Tests and interviews indicated that 22 smoked marijuana every day or two during the treatment period while 49 rarely or never did. At the end of the six-month treatment; 19 (86 percent) of those who used marijuana had successfully completed the therapy -- meaning they took at least 80 percent of their doses over at least 80 percent of the period. Only 29 (59 percent) of the nonsmokers achieved that goal. Similarly; 54 percent of the marijuana users achieved a ""sustained virological response;"" the gold standard goal of therapy; meaning they had no sign of the virus in their bodies six months after the treatment was over. That compared with only 18 percent of those who did not smoke pot. While it is possible that the marijuana had a specific; positive biomedical effect; it is more likely that it helped patients by reducing depression; improving appetite and offering psychological benefits that helped the patients tolerate the treatment's side effects; the team reports in the current issue of the European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology."	2001	2011	64	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Women who do not have enough vitamin B12 in their blood before and after conception have a greater chance of having a baby with brain or spinal cord defects; a new study says. Most at risk may be vegans and vegetarians; since B12 is far more common in meat and animal-based foods; noted an American and Irish research team whose findings were published in the March issue of Pediatrics.. According to the study; women with low levels of B12 had at least 2.5 times the risk of giving birth to a child with these neural tube defects; which can lead to partial paralysis or even death; than women with the highest B12 levels. ""Vitamin B12 is essential for the functioning of the nervous system and for the production of red blood cells;"" Dr. Duane Alexander; director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; said in a news release issued by its parent organization; the U.S. National Institutes of Health. ""The results of this study suggest that women with low levels of B12 not only may risk health problems of their own; but also may increase the chance that their children may be born with a serious birth defect."" Researchers analyzed blood collected during the early pregnancy stages of hundreds of women from Ireland; a country with a high rate of neural tube defects. Either the women had previously given birth to a baby with a neural tube defect or were known to be carrying babies with the disorder. Women with B12 concentrations below 250 ng/L before pregnancy had roughly three times the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect as those with higher B12 blood levels. Those women whose levels were less than 150 ng/L; which is considered B12 deficient; had five times the risk of women with higher levels. The researchers used statistical techniques to focus solely on B12 levels and factor out the role of folic acid; a nutrient known to help prevent pregnant women from birthing babies with neural tube defects. The study authors noted that B12 and folate are jointly linked to several key biochemical reactions; but that a lack of either B12 or folate increased the risk of a neural tube defect. While confirmation from other studies is needed; the authors suggested women should have vitamin B12 levels above 300 ng/L before becoming pregnant. Study co-author Dr. James L. Mills; a senior investigator in the NICHD division of epidemiology; statistics and prevention research; went further; recommending all women of childbearing age always consume the daily recommended amount of vitamin B12 and at least 400 micrograms of folic acid.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm wondering if I could get to advice as to how much Naturthroid to start verses my Levothyroxine. I have looked up the conversion from Naturthroid's website; but everyone says to go slow. I just had blood work done last Thursday (2-28-13). I haven't gotten the lab report yet; but hoping I will from my doctor's office today. I know I'm probably asking to soon before you have my new labs; but I am wanting to get some good advice . As of January 10; 2013; I had to titrate up from around 87 to 100 mcg. due to my labs done on that date. After about 4 weeks of taking the new dose I felt very hyper and requested to have labs done 2-28-13 (doctor wanted me to wait until 3-13-13; but I couldn't. I knew/know something is very wrong inside me right now. I am a bit of a wreck and after talking to a friend who takes Naturthroid; she suggested I take it rather than T4 only. She believes I have RT3 going on and says going on NTH will do me better; but I don't want to start to high on this combo T med. By the way; these are the Lab reports I am waiting on from my doctor's office: TSH; FT3; FT4; RT3. In addition; the doctor also ordered; which is really a waste of money and is redundant; the TSH reflex to abnormal FT4 (which it means; if the TSH is abnormal; test the FT4)! Sheesh; we were already testing the FT4 and TSH. My prior Labs were taken on 1-10-13 - 9 am at LabCorp (87 1/2 mcg) Doing the 75/100 every other day to average this amount (I only use 50 mcg tabs due to dyes): CBC With Differential/ Platelet WBC 8.5 4.0-10.5 x10E3/uL RBC 5.22 3.77-5.28 x10E6/uL Hemoglobin 15.0 11.1-15.9 g/dL Hematocrit 46.1 34.0-46.6 % MCV 88 79-97 fL MCH 28.7 26.6-33.0 pg MCHC 32.5 31.5-35.7 g/dL RDW 13.6 12.3-15.4 % Platelets 371 140-415 x10E3/uL Neutrophils 62 40-74 % Lymphs 31 14-46 % Monocytes 6 4-13 % Eos 0 0-7 % Basos 1 0-3 % Neutrophils (Absolute) 5.4 1.8-7.8 x10E3/uL Lymphs (Absolute) 2.6 0.7-4.5 x10E3/uL Monocytes(Absolute) 0.5 0.1-1.0 x10E3/uL Eos (Absolute) 0.0 0.0-0.4 x10E3/uL Baso (Absolute) 0.0 0.0-0.2 x10E3/uL Immature Granulocytes 0 0-2 % Immature Grans (Abs) 0.0 0.0-0.1 x10E3/uL Glucose; Serum 93 65-99 mg/dL BUN 14 6-24 mg/dL Creatinine;Serum 0.89 0.57-1.00 mg/dL eGFR If NonAfricn Am 73 >59 mL/min/1.73 eGFR If Africn Am 84 >59 mL/min/1.73 BUN/Creatinine Ratio 16 9-23 Sodium; Serum 140 134-144 mmol/L Potassium; Serum 4.6 3.5-5.2 mmol/L Chloride; Serum 100 97-108 mmol/L Carbon Dioxide; Total 23 20-32 mmol/L Calcium; Serum 10.3 (H) 8.7-10.2 mg/dL Protein; Total; Serum 7.4 6.0-8.5 g/dL Albumin; Serum 4.8 3.5-5.5 g/dL Globulin; Total 2.6 1.5-4.5 g/dL A/G Ratio 1.8 1.1-2.5 Bilirubin; Total 0.7 0.0-1.2 mg/dL Alkaline Phosphatase; S 91 25-150 IU/L AST (SGOT) 21 0-40 IU/L ALT (SGPT) 25 0-32 IU/L (I cut back on Calcium to only 1 pill daily instead of 3 - Doc was worried about me possibly getting kidney stones etc.) Other tests taken: TSH 8.220 (H) 0.450-4.500 uIU/mL T4;Free(Direct) 1.35 0.82-1.77 ng/dL FT3 2.6 2.0-4.4 pg/mL Vitamin B12 1221 (H) 211-946 pg/mL (I've heard this is okay being this high from research) Vitamin D; 25-Hydroxy 67.8 30.0-100.0 ng/mL (I increased an addt'l 2k IU) Iron Bind.Cap.

My doctor will allow most likely; but she may not know how much I should start and how soon to titrate. I don't want to be more of wreck than I already am and have been for the past month! Thanks so much and hope someone with good knowledge can help me figure this out before my next doctor's appt; which I can get sooner than 3-15-13 (of course; I'm sure it will be based on my new labs of 2-28-13) Debi	2009	2013		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My daughter-in-law is experiencing unexplainable extreme heart rate elevation with normal exertion such as walking or standing from a seated position. Emergency room personnel recorded a jump from 98 BPM to 130-150 BPM upon standing from a seated position. Subject is 20 years old and in good health. Symptoms started shortly after eating breakfast on a cruise ship. Cruise ship medical personnel diagnosed anxiety as a possible cause; but hospital ultrasound and CBC discovered nothing significant. Yet the condition persists even when subject is under influence of doctor prescribed Xanax. What conditions might be causing this problem?	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a 40-year-old female. This is a long story; but over the past couple of weeks; I have found myself unable to eat. I constantly feel like I've just eaten a huge plate of food or a rich dessert. It's that feeling like you just couldn't possibly eat one more bite. I've had occasional feelings like this over the past few months; but I started Metformin for type 2 diabetes and I thought it might be related. Well; it's certainly not normal to not be able to eat at all. Especially since I've been very heavy my whole life and to be honest; even when I had gallstone pancreatitis a few years back; never missed a meal. I have a very sore; distended abdomen and my left side hurts from top to bottom. A little background. I have a history of mainly right-sided abdominal pain; starting in early 2002. Occasional strange dizzy spells. Investigations (ultrasound; HIDA scan; etc) showed no gallstones and I was pretty much just told to live with it. A few years later; the pain had gotten a lot worse for me. I also had these weird brief squeezing sensations in my flank area. I just blew all of this off because the idea of having more tests and being told nothing was wrong was just too much for me. I finally broke down and saw another doctor at a teaching hospital. In 2007; a gastric emptying study; endoscopy/colonoscopy; another ultrasound showed nothing. I went back to living with the pain. My mother has Crohn's disease and she just lives with it; so I figured I could just wait for things to come to a head. Over the years I would occasionally spike a high fever (once up to 104) and that was followed by diarrhea for a couple of days; but otherwise I just dealt with it. Then I started having attacks of extreme pain. An abdominal CT revealed gallstones in 2009. I didn't have health insurance; so I couldn't afford surgery. I assumed that stones had been the problem all along and they just hadn't found them. In 2013; I had gallstone pancreatitis. I thought the surgery would fix it all. No more extreme attacks that last hours; It has been back to the same right-sided pain as before. My bathroom habits have been strange diarrhea attacks with cramping pain for 15 years or more. Doctors call it IBS. Again; I've learned to live with all of this because doctors have investigated everything pretty thoroughly. Over the past couple of years; things have changed. My symptoms have changed. The pain spreads on my right side more and more. This occasional squeezes on the right flank happen on both sides now. I sometimes have some pretty acute pain on my right side and strange soreness after being bloated and distended for several hours. I sometimes feel like I need to have a bowel movement but nothing happens. I have ovarian cysts that come and go; so I have been chalking a lot of this up to that situation. This is all so strange and I feel like weird telling people this whole story. I have a GI doctor; but he basically refuses to do more tests. Says it's IBS or sphincter of oddi type 3. All liver and pancreas numbers check out. When I stopped being able to eat; my stomach was more bloated and distended than ever before. I had the distinct soreness running from the top right across to the left and basically down my left side. When I take a deep breath; it hurts in my back on my left side. After two days of not being able to eat I went to the ER. They did a CT; collected all the usual blood. Absolutely nothing of interest showed up; except a couple of slightly large ovaries and a borderline enlarged spleen and the fatty liver I've had my whole life since I'm heavy. I have been able to eat a bit more over the past couple of days; but I get full very fast. I've lost 6 lbs really quickly. The night I went to the ER; I had a bowel movement and wiped away nothing but green mucus. The stool was very light tan and basically just looked like brown crisco. It was just fat. All of my bowel movements since have been the same; with copious amounts of green mucus. My whole mid-section is so bloated and sore and I feel short of breath. I am really at a loss for what could be wrong. As I mentioned; my mother has Crohn's disease and she said this sounds nothing like the problems she has. The ER doc mentioned gastroparesis since I have a diabetes; but it actually seems like I digest things FASTER than normal; if anything. I ate grapes a couple of weeks ago and eliminated them whole 4 hours later. This is a really scary feeling. I could deal with everything that happened before and just keep pushing forward; but even drinking liquid is a challenge on occasion. Does anyone have any idea what this sounds like? What my next move forward should be?	2011	2015		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was diagnosed 2 years ago with AIP; have a 25 year history of autoimmune disorders (eosinophilic vasculitis; mild Sjogren's). Usually have done well with prednisone for the various flare-ups but with AIP; still recurring symptoms and the elevated IgG4 periodically. Next step may be Imuran. Is there anyone out there who has had good results with Imuran for autoimmune pancreatitis?	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Has anyone used Colloidal Silver during Interferon treatment? I have heard of people not able to do the Interferon / Ribavirin had used Colloidal Silver as an alternitive. Well I have Hep C. Geno Type 1. And I have been making quality Colloidal Silver for many years. I know all the tricks and processes to produce the smallest partical size possible. Which is absorbed by the body much easier. Well I have been on Pegisis (Interferon) getting close to 6 months now. My first V-count was 790;000. One month of treatment it dropped to 190;000. And then to 4000; and then to 700; and now I am at 42 and looks as if I may clear this. A couple months I had 2 8oz glasses a day of 15ppm Colloidal Silver a day. I have on a minimum 3 glasses of Silver a week. My color is good; not Gray. I just wondered has anyone ventured off into Medical Sience and expiermented like this? I am not recommending anyone try this. I think it has helped me; I dont know. Properly made Colloidal Silver in your home is the best; you control the quality...	2010	2010	51	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 1 month post treatment with SOC. What is so wrong about people with a high BMI being encouraged to try treatment? If it doesn't work by 4 or 12 weeks they can just stop the way any other treater can stop. Why can't we be encouraged too? The reason I'm putting this out there is because I don't feel that there is a whole lot of support for the individuals who have a high BMI and are thinking of treating. In fact I've seen them discouraged!	2008	2009	53	Female

July 2005 ; I wake up one morning with as strange vibrating; pins and needles feeling in my genital area. The feeling persists; comes and goes durign the day but is there every day. August 2005; the ""vibrations"" / pins and needles spread to legs; but are still worse en gentital area. August 2005; MRI of head and lumbar spine; plus neuro examination is normal.B12; Thyroid function; calcium levels etc is normal. September to december 2005; cold feelings in the legs comes and goes; cold feeling in scalp comes ang goes; a feeling of heavines in left side of face happens twice; lasts for a few minutes. Twitches under the feet starts. The worse thing is still the pins and needles feeling everyday in my groin; genetial area! I am exercising without problems. I am really confused; I am gettign scared and my thoughts about this is keeping me awake at night. My questions: Could this be MS? Could this be myastenia Gravis? Waht I fear the most is the paraneoplastic syndrome; what are your thoughts? Is this some kind of neuropathy? I am very interested in knowing if this could be a bening thing; We were planning to have kids; but I do not know what to do now. I don`t want kids if I have a malignant condition. Thank you so much!

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	the profile has just changed and it's good for us; but requires understanding as it just got more complex. I will try to explain and then give you the study. We have long chains of encoding within our DNA. Each strand within that long chain has a combo of the basic proteins. When we speak of the alleles within a group; it is these pieces of data we referrence. the patient only need know that how these proteins are encoded within your cells determines how strongly your body may be able to fight this virus. Past threads have discusses the first test that became available as a genetic predictor. Now labcorp (through Arup) is making available 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rather than 1. what that means is that we will know the Interleukin program within 2 of our gene programs; and have a better predictor of outcome. Now here's where it gets tricky. the original test some members already got showed a 2-3 fold increase in SVr with the right genes. this test is known as the IL28b rs12979860 with this test the best combo to have is C/C; followed by C/T; and by TT being the worst. Now they have moved up the chain to test one more set of alleles; and this test is call the IL28b rs8099917. with this group T/T is the most favorable outcome; followed by G/T followed by GG being the worst. now you see where confusion could come in. TT is least favorable with the test for one grouping; and most favorable with the group next door!! here's the study: http://www.natap.org/2010/HCV/050310_09.htm now I just happened to have had this testing done and my results arrived today. to my surprise I was CC on the rs 12979860 and TT on the rs 8099917 it doesn't get any better than that. this means that I should be able to clear with a PI added especially if I keep my IR down and get my Dietary restrictions in place. It also means my diet had a great deal to do with why I didn't clear because I was extremely compliant on tx and my genes helped; so I should have cleared; except for being stage 3/4 which also may have lowered my chances.	2007	2011	59	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I don't even have to go into a long drawn out story about this. WE THYROIDANS WANT TO LOOSE WEIGHT .................RIGHT? I found a very basic and simple plan that can definately help us combat this nasty problem. Dr Barry Sears has two wonderful books out - one that I have is ""A Week in the ZONE"". Hypo's have two major problems. Controlling insulin in blood sugar and burning carbs. We no longer have the metabolic rate within our bodies to naturally burn these two evils. Hense we get fat and can develop diabetes. Here is a quick glance of a newsletter I get. When you eat a carbohydrate; your pancreas secretes insulin to drive down blood sugar back to a normal level. If you eat too many carbohydrates; your pancreas releases so much insulin that it can drive down blood sugar to a level too low to allow your brain to function effectively. This condition of low blood sugar and high insulin can be considered a step away from diabetes. According to the Zone theory; when you're creating this excess insulin; it also prevents your body from using its stored fat for energy. Hence; your insulin response to excess carbos causes you to gain weight; or you cannot lose weight. If you are looking for a step by step plan to assist your goals - google seach Dr Barry Sears and read the research he offers for hypothyroid patients. Since I am trying myself to conquer my 20 pounds of weight gain. I find it very helpful to have the book I am reading to keep referring back to. If anyone is interested and wants more info - PM me and I will try to answer your questions."	2008	2008	42	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm 53; 5'11""; 265 lbs. (lost about 20 lbs last year). As you can see below I have been through a lot; taking a lot of medicine. My main concern is my sex drive is gone. It has been declining for years. Especially since I started have so many surgeries since 2006. I've been reading sites for years and realized the problem. My GP has been telling me my T level was fine. Back before my Spine fusion in 2010; my surgeon told me that all my symptoms sounded like low T and suggested a Urol. He checked everything out and said it was very low. He started me on Test. (see below). After about the 2-3 injection I felt great; my wife felt betterïŠ. About 3 months later I had the fusion. I went back to the Urog and he said my level was at a good level and it was left up to me. The shots have continued to help my energy; but my sex drive has gone to nothing. I was able to get off my Celexa for about a week and that helped; but this time it's not helping. The depression has got worse. I've tried many times to get off the pain and other medicines; but that makes me worse. They allow me to get up and be able to function every day. I have a great pain Dr. I've noticed my testicles is much smaller and harder than they was. Something has to be done. I think God that my wife understanding with my problem. Money is very limited and I live in a small town; I have to travel about 2-3 hrs. To a true professional; if you know what I mean.. I'm under Medical Supervision! I see my GP every 3 months; and Urologist every 6 months; and my Pain Mang. Every month. I'm still searching for other's experience and advice. GP only suggested is I get off my depression med for a few days break; that use to work; but not no more. Any help is appreciated. One more thing while I'm asking. My nipples burns like they are on fire. They can do it for a minute or they will do it for hours; sometime days. I can go for days between or weeks and sometimes months. My GP says my shirts are irriatating them. That is BS; I've had it happening to long and know it can be with or without shirt; hot or cold. Nothing will stop it; I've used every type of numbing medicine; etc. It stops when it wants to. Had a health food lady tell me one time that I needed to take women vitamins; said my estrogen is high. Ok I'm taking Testro Shots; does that make sense?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am new to this; but here it goes...I am 32 years old and I just had a pituitary tumor removed 3 weeks ago. I have been trying to find out how people felt after the surgery. I of course have headaches; and dizziness. But it actually feels like my head is clearer...before my surgery I couldnt seem to form a thought; I was so weak. I still have weakness but not as bad. My eyes used to hurt; and very hard to focus. I didnt have the best experience after the surgery; they didnt even give me discharge instructions. During my follow up with the O.R. nurse she finally told me that I cant sniff; blow my nose; try not to sneeze and dont hold my head down. She said for at least 2 to 3 months!! Is that for real???? I am on hydrocortisone 3 times a day; and before the surgery i was diagnosed with hypersomnia; because i couldnt seem to stay awake. I would wake up; and about 1 to 2 hours later I will fall asleep. I had to stop driving because i would fall asleep. I am more alert now; but how long will it take to start feeling normal again??? Will I ever feel normal again???	2009	2009		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I had a heart attack (MI) in 1992 followed by a PE and pulse that went up 185 and diagnosed type 2 diabetic requiring insulin injections. Two years ago I changed my lifestyle and eating habits and with weight loss and exercise managed to come off insulin injections and 20 months later my HbA1c (without any medication ) is running at 6%. With this change which was achieved by not following standard dietary information encourages me to believe that further improvement can be gained blood pressure has dropped from 185/90 to 104/75 (with reduced medication). I had an angiogram in 2005 during which it was recommended to either have stents or a bypass which I declined to see if my new regime could generate improvement ; which happened and have been told that surgery is not required at this stage. My diet has moved to organic plant based and would like to know if a simple non invasive test can be performed to assess changes with in my arteries either getting better or worse? Currently my cholesterol = 140 with Hdl =60 both of which I am trying to improve.	2007	2007		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	For a few days now I have been experiencing itching on my plams of hands and feet but it's not a consent thing. I thought maybe it could have been an allergic reaction to tomatoes or some other food. I have been taking some natural detox for the blood in pills form; I was feeling ok but last nite and this morning my hands started up again but not terrible that i want to rip them off; it's more of a burning irritating itch that is under the skin; no rash no dry skin and it tends to be activated when I do things like opening a soda bottle top or holding the retractable lead for the dogs...I guess if there is a certain kind of pressure and rubing againist the hands they start to bother me and usually cold water or ice; anything cold makes it feel better. I had experienced a migraine a few days ago but I get those normally so I dont know if that has something to do with it. Any ideas on what would cause this kind of itching on the palms of the hands and feet under the skin?? I really hope it's not something were I need to go see a doctor; no insurance and no job = no money :(	2006	2006

With the help of my wife and others in Doncaster; I have compiled this. 8years ago; at the age of 39 yrs. I was a high flying energetic senior manager within a large uk-ftse. company;I had worked for many corporations in a senior position very successfully more than 23yrs and a director of my own businesses; however I suffered a massive nervous breakdown. I suffered and am still suffering with hypertension; high cholesterol; and abnormal electrical QT wave diagnosed when I was 24years old.Due to constantly having heart pain; I underwent stress tests which I was unable to complete; after having an angiogram; it was then found that under stress; my heart arteries and blood vessels constrict severely causing me pain. All this eventually with my high work ethic; caused me to have a nervous breakdown; I then was unable to work and I fell into severe depression; all this was been treated with medication as belpw. Then 3years ago; whilst out with my wife; I experienced loss of feeling in my left leg for approx. 10minutes and then the same thing in the left arm. My wife and I laughed it off; wondering what was going off; I also felt unwell and dizzy. My left side felt weak; so after having a couple of drinks we went to bed early. The next morning I was unable to wake up and get up properly; so my wife came upstairs and noticed that the left hand side of my mouth and eye had drooped on the left side of my face. I was very dizzy and unsteady and weak on my left leg and left arm; and I had this very severe pain behind my left eye socket; and my wife states that I was slurring and unsteady due to dizziness. My 24year old daughter said; that this looked like a stroke; the paramedics who came out were shocked that on inspection I had not gone to the hospital for treatment the day before; they immediately took me into Doncaster Royal Infirmary for hospital treatment. I was treated for a stroke and subsequent CT; MRI scans and the consultant reports within the first 48hrs states as follows; ‘‘ This gentleman’s symptoms suggestive of ataxic hemiparesis; would be in keeping with a lacunar syndrome although the white matter changes in the MRI are more predominant in the left hemisphere than the right and I cannot identify any clear brain stem lesion on review on the PACS today. Undoubtedly there is some functional overlay component. This gentleman’s presentation is in keeping with his significant history of depression. His signs would be in keeping with a lacunar stroke and I note that carotid dopplers show carotid atheromatous disease in the asymptomatic artery; Therefore it is entirely reasonable for him to be on appropriate vascular preventative therapy. He is aware of persistent sensory deficit which is causing him anxiety.’’ I have been diagnosed as having cerebral vascular disease; hypertension; angina; diabetes type2; reflux; glaucoma; asthma; depression. early stages of diabetic retinopathy I am on medication for my above health issues as follows; Clopidogrel 75mg; Amlodopine 10mg; Montelukast 10mg; Atorvastatin 40mg; Irbesartan 300mg; Bendroflumethaizide 2.5mg; Pregabalin 600mg; Metformin 500mg; Isosorbide Mononitrate 60mg; Lansoprazole 30mg. Salbutamol and Seretide inhalers. Glyceryl Nitrate GTN spray for angina. Cocodamol and Paracetamol for pain management. However from the moment I had this mild stroke I have been getting recurring stroke like type symptoms; for now 3years after from 3 to 7days a week during my sleep and frequently during the day. Initially my left leg had a small shake uncontrollably; however since being prescribed Pregabalin in the 1stsix months;its virtually stopped. These attacks which can be from light to severe attacks are as follows; a light attack feels like an electrical current going through my head and dizziness; and then a heavy attack sometimes precedes with a tingling numb-like feeling in left-hand side of my face; dizziness; pain in my head; pain in my left eye socket; a drooped mouth and left eye and left hand-side face; weakness in left arm and left leg; unable to walk; slurred speech; tingling in the left-hand side of face; blurry vision. These attacks whether light; medium or heavy; always ends up with myself being completely fatigued; confused with dizziness and then my brain forces me to sleep; from 2 to 4 hrs. or so. Once i have recovered ie woken up after a sleep from 2 to 4hrs; i feels sometimes like I am drunk and very hung-over for a day or two; I am completely washed out; with varying pains; headaches and i am unable to walk once these attacks happen and i am very weak on my left side leg and arm daily and on-going. I get dizzy spells during an attack and also when im not having an attack. Also I am slurring; or mumbling during an attack; my speech is clear when I am not suffering attacks however my wife and children have stated that sometimes i say the wrong words or whilst speaking sometimes put the wrong words that im trying to say; in the wrong part of a sentence; which they find amusing; and i find frustrating and angry with myself for doing that; but i do not have slurred speech outside an attack unless I am tired.. My vision has deteriorated since the stroke; and my left eyesight is terrible; i have just been diagnosed with glaucoma and diabetes and early stages of diabetic retinopathy; however the medics are looking into my eyesight issues but with no joy. As a previous troubleshooter in management and business; in working as a consultant in performance and productive environments and with working knowledge of performance measures within the national health service; i feel I am a problem to performance and productivity figures as i am still on the consultants caseload. However these are just my feelings. My local GP; is understanding and very GOOD at helping me emotionally and with medication to control my symptoms. I have never ever regained the full strength in my left leg or arm; this was only a small stroke; due to clotting from furred up carotid artery the consultants have informed me. I am constantly in turmoil over this; feeling very depressed and even suicidal on a daily basis; My stroke was not a bleed; it was a mild stroke; possibly caused by a clot from the diagnosed furred up carotid artery in my neck. My uncles; grandparents on both sides have died from strokes and heart attacks I just need some answers or other experiences and how they have coped or resolved. I need help and answers and im praying for answers; please help someone; all this makes me feel very suicidal. Doing this email is very hard mentally as i am constantly drained; it has taken me 3 weeks on and off to try and compile this email with the help of my wife and others.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi everyone I will be starting Clomid next month and wanted to know how many of you ladies have been on and how many have you got pregnant on the first cycle. Alittle bit nervous about the whole thing but I know it will be alright. I really cant wait to get started on the whole thing. So any feedback and thoughts about Clomid would be appreciated. Thanks a bunches... Anna	2007	2007		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello everyone I think that this form will be very helpful for all that are on Clomid or that will start Clomid soon. Let me start by saying that I have PCOS and I have 11 year old daughter I have been TTC on and off the last 7 years but since I been married a year ago we been trying faithfully. I was on Clomid in Nov. 2009 I was taking 50mg 3-7cd I was told that I didnt O on this round and that I would need to go up on my next round. Dec came and went no AF so went in to see if I was Pergo but no I was not so they put me on provrea then Clomid on 3-7 100mg. I am now on my 3 and last round of Clomid I am on 150mg 3-7 days and I hope that this time I O because on my last round they told me I O early on cd 15 I have never O in 11 years so that was a good thing. But doc said that the numbers where not where he wanted them to be at so that is why he up my clomid this time. As for side effects on 50mg I had mood swings and hot flashes and the wonderful headaches... On 100mg I thank god I did not have any but did have crazy dreams with them. And with 150mg I had the vision problems. I just hope that this time works. Would love to hear your stories on Clomid and hear how long before you got your BFP on Clomid...	2010	2010	30	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; I have been undergoing cortisol testing for a couple months. My UFC has always been elevated (since I started testing for it a few years ago). For several years I have had Hashimoto's; Sjogren's; FM; asthma since birth; anxiety & depression for over 30 years; IBS and the list goes on and on. Finally after complaining enough to my Endo; and proving to him that I have gained weight (mainly stomach and back) for no reason and cannot lose it no matter what I do (I had to provide him with RMR test results; which state I have a fast metabolism; food and exercise journals; etc) he started to look into it for me. The UFC is always around 100. He has not given me the results of the last one I did in June even though I have asked more than 5 times. After the UFC test; I did a dex supp test. I took the dex pill at 11 pm and blood draw at 8 am the following morning. The serum cortisol suppressed from 41 down to 4.1. My endo said that was good but not good enough; that it needed to supp below 2. It's been 3 weeks since those tests. Tonight I am doing the salivary cortisol test; and tomorrow night another 1 mg dex supp test. He wants to check the actual dex level to see if there's something that is causing the supp not to fully work. I have Kaiser HMO and they don't normally do the salivette tests. They special ordered the salivette kit for me and I just picked it up. There's no instructions. It's being done through QUEST and theres conflicting information on test prep. Some directions say to rinse your mouth out with clean water and wait 10 minutes before doing the test at midnight. Others do not tell you to rinse. Does anyone know what I am supposed to do? Nobody at Kaiser is familiar with the test. Also; can my thyroid problems have anything to do with cortisol problems? This is what the endo emailed me about my thyroid tests: ""As far as the reverse T3 is concerned; it is high; again this is found in ""stressed"" states; it is part of a ""sick euthyroid"" process with is a stressed state causing the shift. Chronic ""sick euthyroid"" conditions are not well described like acute sick euthyroid. We are still waiting for the free T3 level to come back."". We initially found the high RT3 over a year ago so I added cytomel in May 2010. I take it 2x a day and cant even feel it like most people say they do. I could easily take it and fall right asleep. Could all of this (cortisol/thyroid/autoimmune) be related? I take the following meds: levothroid 100 mcg 1x day; cytomel 5 mcg 2x day; wellbutrin 150 sr 2x day; famotidine 40 mg 2x day; yasmin; hydroxyzine; green tea; vitamins; some days I take motrin 800. I ocassionally use an albuterol inhaler and about 1x a year; when I have a bad asthma flare; I have to do a 4 day round of prednisone; not enough to cause elevated cortisol. Any help would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post. Thank you."	2008	2011		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I started with 1 nodule accidently found in 2008 and now have 4 nodules and my PCP said I now have "" non toxic multinodular goiter"". I have an apt with the endocrinologist on Tuesday and would like someone with the same experience to give me suggestions on what to ask. I already was told to ask for the antibody tests to check for Hashimotos disease. My PCP wants me to have a biopsy because the nodules have become more solid. I had a FNA biopsy in 2010."	2015	2015	58	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello everyone; First thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm just trying to understand what is happening with my MIL. She is a 68 yr old female with CHF; Diabetes; Chronic back pain from nerve damage; and now esld we think from the years of pain meds. She was complaining of symptoms for 1.5 years I know and her primary care doctor did not find the liver disease. Now we are told because of her other health issues and the advanced stage of her ld there is nothing that can be done. She has ascites; edema; stomach pain. She was sent home on hospice for CHF with palliative care only. She is not being treated with lactulose because they said it was not helping. Now she has been told they will not do anymore drains because the fluid will come back quicker. I don't understand why these things are being with held from her since they are comfort measures. Thanks for reading this my MIL is very special to me. She is the only grandparent my kids have left and they are still very young. Maybe I am just having trouble accepting that the end us near. Thanks Denise	2015	2015		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi i had comprehensive private blood tests about 2 weeks ago; i took them to my doctor and he retested me for all of them to check; i think they suggest hyperthyroid; possible malabsorption; possible auto immune; any thoughts/ Vit D = 26 ( second test 24 ); Normal range = 75 to 200 Vit Folate = 3.8 (second test 3.4); private normal range 4.6 - 18.7 ( NHS normal range 3 - 20) Vit B12 = 285; ( second test 241) private Norm range = 191- 946 ( NHS norm range 140-600) Creatinine level of 114 ( second test 101); abnormal is above 110 Whit blood cell = 4.3; ( second test 4.7) Norm range 4 - 11 RBC = 11.9 ; NHS Normal range 11.6 -14.6 Fasting glucose 5; Norm is above 6.2 TSH = 2 ; ( second test 0.8) NHS normal range 0.35 - 5 Free t4 = 25.2 ; Norm range 12-22 I wasnt tested for free t4 the second time; i was tested for Total t4 instead which was 19.9 ; norm range 10-19 Im losing weight; my food goes straight through me; i have all the hyper symptoms except bulging eyes and goiter. I believe i have suffered with a vit D problem for years; as i have bad knees; i have never been to the doctors about them until recently; but i believe the vit D has given me arthritis in my knees; im seeing a specialist in a month about my knees. But i also believe if you have a Vit D problem for a while it can cause you to develop a thyroid problem? malabsorption problem? or auto immune prob? My family has a long list of auto immune probs Anyway ; my doctor is starting me on Vit D tablets today for 2 months and then i go on a lower dose for 1 month. He said i shouldnt worry about the low vit B12 or folate; even though i believe the folate is very low and as i was misdiagnosed with a nurological disorder for 10 years and im still having problems with my speech i thought my b12 could do with being a lot higher. He said to take the vit D for 3 months and then come back to retest to see what my Vit D; b12; and folate levels were; He also said the thyroid can be affected by stress and as my body was low in vit D it would be good to retest thyroid again in 3 months after the Vit D kicks in. I dont know if im just been given the brush off; im happy to just take vit D for 3 months and then go back for tests; but what i wanted to know was should i be taking b12 or folate as well; or be asking to see an endo? thyroid probs do run in the family; but its hypo not hyper Thanks for any help	2014	2014	34	Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I posted the bulk of this in the auto-immune & kidney forums; but I just want to get a ""whadda you think"" from people who have been through all the testing; diagnosis; MISdiagnosis; etc. I will post my current issue; then follow up below it with further background to explain why I feel this might be an appropriate forum for this. I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08; Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight; when there is no logical reason for it. Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone); PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal; just started Metformin therapy). On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June; my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a ""normal"" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website; but no mention was made to me; at my followup appt. On 01-06-10; I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit; my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again; no mention was made of this; although; in his defense; my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels; at this visit; which were very much out of range. I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here; as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59; for a woman; is suggestive of possible kidney damage; and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop; as they have in my case. I am obese (240 lbs); so I know that can affect the numbers; but I also have been plagued; over the yrs; with various auto-immune issues (ITP; Hashimoto's); and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes; that adds yet another concern. I do have some light edema in both legs; at the end of the day & severe pitting edema in my left leg; due to a severe injury in 2004; for which I wear a compression stocking. I know lymphatic system issues are another sign of kidney issues. ****Okay; now let me explain why I am thoroughly confused & troubled by all this (aside from obvious). As mentioned above; I have a history of KNOWN auto-immune problems. I also know that many of these disorders can overlap & you can very easily have more than one. What I can't understand is why the doctors are not discussing my eGFR & creatinine levels with me; given my past/current auto-immune problems & my current pre-diabetic state. My kidney function should be a glaring red flag to them; right now..esp. with the edema. What I did not mention above; but may have mentioned in old; old posts in other forums; is that I did have one ANA test done; a few yrs ago; after I saw my PCP for a VERY bizarre (for me) reaction to the sun. I am as lily white as they come & don't get deliberate exposure to the sun very often at all. That summer; I got a wild hair to add some color. On the very 1st attempt to sunbathe in my back yard; I had only been lying on the lawn chair for about 5 min. when my whole body started itching like ants were attacking me all over. I jumped up; thinking I had lain in an ant bed. Nothing. I tried to lay back down; but the itching was unbearable. I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to the sunscreen or the plastic on the chair; so I went in & took a shower. Within 30 min; I was covered head to toe in a ""chigger-like"" rash. My husband looked at it & said ""You have chiggers!"" We live in an area not known for chigger infestations; but I mentioned this to my PCP; & he agreed it was not likely chiggers. Because of the past auto-immune stuff; he ran the ANA; but it came back negative; so he diagnosed ""contact dermatitis; unknown cause"". I am now wondering; with everything else; if I didn't have a Lupus flare; despite the negative ANA. I've been too scared to tempt fate with the sun again. Also; since then; I have recurrent urticarial flares (hives); which sometimes cause my eyes & throat to swell shut (anaphylaxis). My PCP could not find a cause for that either; so he just wrote me an RX for an Epi Pen. Even if it isn't Lupus; I am very; very concerned & worried abt what might be happening to my kidneys. My understanding is that you can slow the drop of your eGFR & slow or stop the progression of kidney disease; but you can never regain those numbers or that function back. Kidney disease is nothing I want to mess around with. Any thoughts? Thanks; Angela"	2007	2010

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Anyone functioning well enough to answer; to discuss your coping with stroke deficits that have remained for a year ago or longer. My stroke was more than 3.5 years ago and I still have some resentment about everything that I can't do. I would like to get a better attitude about it. But either way you are handling it; it would be helpful for me to hear about anyone else who still struggles with problems. I feel that hearing from someone who is in the same position as I am; would be the best therapy for me. Thanks in advance to anyone who answers this. Sara	2011	2012		Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	In the last few months I have been getting a sudden weakness in both arms. It comes on suddenly and lasts a maximum of 5 minutes. When it happens I cannot lift anything. I feel so weak that I have to sit or lie down until it passes. This week it hit me twice. Before these 2 incidents; the last time this happened was a month ago and before that was probably another month (2 times in a week). The sensation is from the shoulders down to my hands. Any ideas?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"This is my final resort. In the past few weeks I've been to the E.R. twice; my regular phsycian numerous times; a neurologist; an endocronologist and an infectious disease doctor. I've had numerous MRI's; blood tests; etc. and everything has come back negative. (other than a test that says my B12 level is kind of low) Currently I'm been experienceing: *Constant ""brain-fog"" - feeling completely out of it or as though i'm on drugs or alcohol - unreal feeling *persistent stomach pains and gas *headaches *weakness *unexplained anxiety/panic attack/depressive sympt. *numbness *loss of appetite *irritability *chills/hot flashes *spots in front of my eyes Last night I had extreme stomach pains and diarreha - which was a first for me since this began. Afterwards; all of the symptoms seemed to subside. I did not eat for the rest of the night or the mroning. However; once I ate lunch the brain-fog and other symptoms reoccured. I'm now thinking this could be a GI issue. Can anyone help me?!"	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I used depo provera injections for two and a half years. It's been over a year since my last injection. within the first six months after stopping the shot I gained 40lbs without a change in my diet and excercise.I was told this was unusual to gain after stopping the shot and that i may never lose the weight. Is this true? or is the only way to go back on the shot because while i was on the shot i actually lost weight.but if that's the answer won't i be trapped on the shot forever?	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 21 year old woman struggling with steadily declining health. I have struggled with chronic stomach pain and constipation; restless leg syndrome; vulvodynia and asthma since early childhood. Rosacea; severe depression and anxiety; fatigue; brain fog (derealization/depersonalization); hypothyroidism; facial pain; and sporadic but managable muscle pain since early /mid teens. I have bruised at the drop of a hat and struggled with being overweight since I was young; and have chronic lower right quadrant pain in my abdomen that flares up strongly when I do most forms of cardio (or sometimes for no reason; I had a paranoia about appendicitis for years from it). Gluten seemed to make things worse; so I stopped eating the obvious sources (bread; pasta; etc) two years ago but I was lacking in information and didn't know about cross contamination so I was undoubtedly still ingesting some. I was having difficulty eating as a wide group of foods started bothering me in a variety of ways- from stomach pain to fatigue to worsened rosacea or asthma. I suspected celiac or other food intolerances but my IGA test actually came back mildly deficient. I saw a gastro that told me to do a gluten challenge so she could do an endoscopy; which I did for 8 weeks. It was the worst 2 months of my life. I spent the first two days being violently ill; with a reaction that resembled food poisoning but no one else in my family was affected. I developed severe fatigue and sciatic pain that made it hard to walk. I could not eat anything without having to lay down for an hour afterwards because it made me so sick to my stomach. I had so much gas in my stomach one sip of water would cause me to burp again and again for 30 minutes; and meals were much worse. My anxiety and depression; which had been pretty well managed for about two years; came back so strongly I had panic attacks while I was trying to sleep. I had such severe brain fog I lost the ability differentiate between dreams and reality and believed I was a ghost. I felt detached from my body; and I felt like someone else was controlling me. I developed pain all over my body and muscle weakness that made me exhausted after one trip up the stairs. My restless leg syndrome; which had been in remission for four years; came back affecting my entire body including my genitals in a way I believe is similar to restless genital syndrome. I was completely and utterly miserable and I spent 80% of the time in my bed wishing for death. They did the endoscopy and colonoscopy and I immediately cut gluten out of my diet and started attempting to avoid CC. My results came back negative on everything except for gastritis; which I believe was actually caused by the gluten. Unfortunately for me; while some of the symptoms did decrease and I no longer feel like a ghost; I didn't get better enough. The muscle pain was diagnosed as fibromyalgia; the restlessness in my entire body is still present; my anxiety and depression have set me back pretty far; the brain fog is still bad enough that I can't drive; my stomach is still inflamed to the point that I can't eat grains or processed food and am living off bananas and chicken. It's been three months since my procedure. Before the trial; I was lifting weights and going biking and gardening and attempting to feel like a normal human being but now my body is still in utter chaos. I used my elliptical machine for 10 minutes yesterday; slowly; on the lowest setting; and today I am in utter agony. And no one will believe me that I have food issues. I essentially got a pat on the head from my gastro; and now the rheumatologist I went to for my fibro diagnosis wants to put me on Plaquenil because although my Lupus tests came back negative she wants to see if it will change anything; but I'm terrified to try something that heavy. I just don't know what to do! I can't even go to the store longer than 30 minutes because it gives me such bad back pain to walk for that long; and I can't work or go to school and I have no friends or hobbies that I can do. I'm so sad all the time; at this point I just want to die. I'm only 21! What can I do?? Does this sound like any disease you've heard of? Everyone keeps telling me it can't be celiac because ""your scopes were normal;"" but so far no one has come up with a better idea. I don't know what I'll do if these symptoms never go away. Please help me."	2010	2013		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am a 26 y-o- Female. For the past 3 months now I have been having strange symptoms like nausea; dizziness (extreme at times); headache behind the eye and sensitivity to light; joint/muscle aches and stiffness mostly in hands and feet but occassionally like a full body flu-type attack; weakness in wrists; cold feet and hands that feel like they are plunged in ice water whenever I take a hot bath/shower; constant feeling of cold so that I just can't get warm; occasional hot flashes and chills; exhaustion and sleepiness all day but hard to stay asleep; and memory problems/disorientation like a brain ""fog""; flashes and shadows out of the corner of my eyes; and some other symptoms not listed. I have a history of Graves Disease diagnosed at 12 years old and treated for several years with PTU. I had a relapse at the age of 18 and had radioactive ablation of the thyroid done. I have recently seen a rhuematologist due to a slightly elevated RH factor (14) and he drew more labs to detect Lupus and other autoimmune connective tissue disorders; all of which came out negative or normal including the CCP test for rheumatoid arthritis. Though my TSH levels have been hard to keep stable (recently miscarried at 8 weeks with a TSH of 40); this last test was normal (Currently taking thyroxin 100 mcgs and Cytomel 10 mcgs) including antibody and FT4 and FT3 levels. Blood count and lIver tests were also normal. Xrays of hands and chest were normal. Opthamologist visit reported normal eyes except for slight dryness. Other than these; I have a history of repeated low vit D levels; atypical PCOS as determined by cystic ovaries on ultrasound and borderline insulin resistence; but no androgenic factors. I go to neurology in a month's time and also back to rheumatology. I know there are autoimmune disorders of the nervous system that can cause some of these symptoms; but I have not noticed numbness or nerve-like pains or extreme muscle weakness that seem to be found in most of them. I know it is possible that I have the early stages of rhuematoid arthritis as I do have a family history of it; but some of these symptoms don't seem to fit. Any ideas about what could be going on with me and further testing I need to pursue? Thank you."	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I found the above topic last night at this same forum; though its dated 6 yrs back and I couldnt find anything more recent as I was searching for an answer to my own problem of the foulest burps that ever existed; then comes the diarhea and finally the vomitting. For me this can last up to two or three days. I was so relieved to find that other people have and are experiencing these same symptoms. Though im worried that no one has found and answer; maybe they have; as I said; the only forum I found for this is on this web site and its 6 yrs old. Im hoping someone has some new answer to this same problem. Its dibilitating when it happens; hard to go to work while im busy crapping and puking myself to half to death. Again; the burps are the absolute worst; those alone taste so bad its enough to make me sick and the sulphuric smell is just awful. Really its like im farting out my mouth. Hopefully after 6 yrs someone has some kind of real answer to this problem. Thk you.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hello everyone; 25/M About a year ago I began experiencing some strange sensations which I sometimes have trouble finding the words to describe; but their presence is definitely there regardless. In a nutshell my symptoms seem to be fatigue; lightheadedness; ""brain fog""; trouble focusing; numbness and generally just feeling disconnected. I'm ""not there"" so to speak; both physically and mentally. I can still function in my daily life; but doing anything that requires real thought (including conversation) is very hard sometimes and it's sort of like my mind and body have been numbed and covered in novocain. I feel stoned and like things just aren't really hitting me so to speak. There are times when it's hard to even focus my eye sight on anything; as all my eyes want to do is drift off and blankly stare in to the middle distance while my head shuts. I'm like a zombie and talking to people is like struggling through improv. It doesn't feel natural and life is sort of like reading the words out of a book and understanding what they mean; but not quite having them quite connect. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy; or that I'm not even a real person...but again; it's hard to describe. I also have fatigue; which hits me very hard toward the end of the day (along with dizzy spells) and all I want to do is crash in my bed when I get home from work. I've also suddenly developed large bags/circles under my eyes over the last year; but I'm not sure how that could be related. I've had every type of bloodwork done which all came back normal as did my EEG. This has brought me to the conclusion that it has to be something ""mental"" as opposed to physical; but whether that's anxiety; ADD; depression; depersonalization; post traumatic stress disorder or something else is hard to say. I tried taking Lexapro for a short while which may have helped a bit; but I stopped about a month in since it completely killed my libido and that wasn't even remotely acceptable to me. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? Is this all in my head or are there physical disorders that can result in these feelings? My only other lead is that I started feeling this way shortly after I moved in to my new apartment; so it's possible there's some sort of mold that's making me have problems. I also feel somewhat better when I visit my parents out of state for a week; but that could very well just be in my head or a result of lessened anxiety...Who knows. I just need help and I honestly don't know what else to ask."	2009	2009	25	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have a severe problem with profuse sweating...I have had it for as long as I can remember...I can't keep my hair dry..my face is wet and dripping with sweat it's very embarrasing and disabeling. I can walk from my front door to the car and my face is sweating like I had ran a marathon...I can't go on like this I need suggestions please. I am 56 weight about 230 and in good health otherwise. I take asthma medication singular and abluteral inhaler as needed. Is there a medication I can take or a surgery? I can't stand this any longer it's living hell. I don't mean to sound so desperate but it's horrible to live like this I cry about it and stay so miserable. It can be below zero outside and I sweat...If I just sweep the floor I get so hot I have to take a break to cool down...the smallest amount of exercise makes me sweat badly. Sweat pours from my face; my back my clothes stick to me and my makeup runs off. ;my hair is wet...my face gets blood red and I'm just miserable daily. Is there an answer I would really appreciate some help. Thank you	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm new to this and just hoping to get some good answers from some of ya'll with thyroid disease. I had my first and only child in Dec '05. Developed hyperthyroidism April '06 and have been ever since even to this day. I have gone to several Endo's and got answers like Grave's Disease; Hashimoto's; thyroid going to fail; etc. Not one of the same diagnosis from any Endo. I have a new Endo appt. next Thursday at U. of Penn and I got some great references so I hope he is the one. My levels have gone down considerably. Here are some of my results: Thyroglobulin Antibodies 93 High (<20) Thyroid Peroxidase >1000 high (<35) T3; Total 473 high (60-181) T4; Free 3.3 high (0.8-1.8) TSH 0.01 low The TSH has been bouncing between 0.01 and 0.02 low. The t4; Free had been at 10.6 but has come down a bit. The T3 is slowly but surely increasing a bit every time I get a new blood test. The Endo that thought I have Hashimoto's said it was becasue of the antibodies. The other Endo said that I was going to crash and be low; Hashimoto's. Another one said that I had Grave's and the last one said it was Post-partum thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism only and that in time I would recover. As all of this is going on; I have gained 20 lbs. and I'm very sad; I just can't get it off and I'm only eating about 200-300 calories a day now. This is something that is confusing doctors too. Along with the thyriod; I suddenly developed PCOS. My gyno thinks it's from the thyroid levels being high and the Reproductive Endo tells me its not. Now I'm one birth control which makes me nauseous all day long. I've tried almost all brands on the market and I still get nauseous all day long. I live outside of Philadelphia and we are lacking in good Endo's in this area so I keep searching for the right one that seems to know what is going on. This has turned into a nightmare; I'm supposed to be enjoying my life as a new mommy and I'm so sad all of the time; I keep getting fatter and fatter!! Maybe someone else has a similar problem; heard of it before; knows someone with the same problem or can give me any advice as to what is going on with me. I will be so absolutely grateful to you.	2007	2007	30	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	H-E-L-P!!! I've had this uncontrollable itch on my outer labia's for the past 7 years. Everyday I itch; I feel like a freak because I am always scratching (not in public). My labia gets sore from the scratching and I break skin often from scratching. I have tried everthing; but it doesn't go away. I know it's not an STD because I went to the doctor's and have been tested. However they haven't helped me none. The labia skin is thickened from the scratching; is very dry (white-like) and flaky (at times). So are my inner thighs at the crease yet they do not itch that often. There are no bumps but my skin is raised; and I don't know what it is. I thought about Lichen; but I do not see my vagina changing in that form; like the pictures that I have researched. Please Please help me figure out what other problems there might be. I have been in the same relationship all this time. Also; if you know any remedies for the itching; please send my way. I use All Free & Clear laundry detergent; and wash with warm water as I fell needed throughout the day. I also don't get my period often; I tied my tubes in 2003; so I don't take any BC. I am not on any medication. Just looking for what else might there be... Thanks; Itchy_Itchy	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm 25 and I have always had irregular periods; but now I have had one that has lasted about 6-7 weeks and counting. It's sometimes heavy and then most of the time it's light. Sometimes it's like 'period' blood and other times it fresh - like i've just cut myself. I've been to see the nurse and she did a few blood tests and the results are i have to go back for a prolactin test in 3 months. She also did a pregnancy test - but I can't be pregnant. I'm about 3 stone over weight and the nurse said that wasn't the problem. I am not taking any medication and i'm not on any birth control (my fiance had a vasectomy in 1989). I have recently changed my diet for the better - eating fresh; homemade food instead of processed. I also haven't had any major stress in my life recently. When it first started i was tired a lot - but not after 6 odd weeks; i don't seem to have any side effects. Can someone help please.	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi. FOr ages I have been complaining about dizziness and a pins and needles feeling in my left cheek. (by ages; since 2003) I have been sent for ultrasound of coratid artery (no problems) and and MRI/MRA (no problems) but the symptoms are not only stil there; they are getting worse; considerably. I have noticed that this summer; with humidity real high; they are horrible! When this happens; I will feel a pins and needles type tingling from actually right below my jaw bone; covering the entire left side of my face to the left of my eye and about a 1/3 of the way into my forehead on same side. This will intensify as the day goes on. Then my neck will hurt BAD! Again; always the left; from my shoulder blade; sort of up the back of my neck; to behind my left ear. After that I will be hit with HUGH waves of dizziness; sometimes to the point of almost blacking out. I have a real feeling something is major wrong! I feel somewhat sick to my stomach. When I say dizziness; it isn't like everything spins; it is like I feel out of whack. This really has me worried. It comes out of no place; my stress level is probably the lowest it has been in years ( I quit work a few months ago and am glad about that decision - no $$ issues because of it) Does ANYONE have a clue? My dr. just told me medicine can't fix everything; but THIS IS NOT NORMAL and NOT in my head. I just don't want to have to have a stroke to prove it!	2006	2006		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I love running; using aerobic equipment and lifting weights; however; I ususually experience flu-like symtoms for days; sometimes weeks; later.

Any suggestions?	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	For around three or four years now; I have been suffering from headaches some two hours or more after the consumption of any amount of alcohol - although typically as few as two drinks upwards of any kind of alcohol. The headaches come on slowly but persistently and follow a line from the left side of my neck across the top of my head to just above the left eyebrow. They are not sharp pains but more of a constant 'throb' and can go on for hours. Pain relief medication does nothing and the only relief I can get at all is the application of something topical like '4-Head' or the American 'Head-On'. Although I have been a reasonably 'active' drinker in the past; if anything now; at the age of 61 (male); I rarely have more than two drinks at a time ... which is why I'm surprised at the onset of these headaches. My own doctor has; thus-far; not taken it very seriously and tends to take the line that; after years of 'getting away with it; maybe you've finally developed an allergy!'	2007	2008	61	Male

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'll be 46 at the end of this month & just moved to a new state so I don't have the luxury of knowing any doctors. In the last 1-2 months I suddenly gained 40 + lbs & look pregnant. That seems to be where the weight all is. A urinalysis proved negative for pregnancy on Monday & with my 3 grown kids I did not gain this much weight &/or so fast. I just look pregnant & feel ""full - heavy - tired & short of breath"" most of the time. Tomorrow I go for a Pelvic ultrasound w/a full bladder. The day after I am scheduled for an Abdomen ultrasound - w/fasting. Any idea what we are looking for or what could cause this? I can barely eat because I feel so full & yet it's lately that I've gained the most weight. I am not in pain; I just feel miserable - like over due. When I asked at the doctor's office what could cause this & what we are looking for they said 'a cyst; tumor; or cancer'...... I would kind of like a bit more information if at all possible. In the last week I gained another 10lbs & I know this can not be good or keep on. Thanks; JoeShell"	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am 27 years old and husband and I have been trying to conceive for 1 year. Dr. just diagnosed infertility and ordered a semen analysis (the 1st step for us) but we haven't done it yet. Now; my period is 5 days late (I calculate like a crazy woman). I am NEVER late and was sure THIS WAS IT. Lo and behold the test had a big minus. I cried. I didn't test in the a.m. but it says you don't have to. I am scared to test again just to see another sad result. I feel queasy but maybe I am wishing these symptoms on. How accurate are these tests?? How long should I wait to do it again?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have muscle spasm in or around the ribs on both sides (in the front under the breast and sometimes in the back at the same horizontal position); it feels like a ball rolling; in that it switches sides. It occurs even at night during sleep; painful enough to wake me. I only know that when I relax and stretch (the side where the knot is) using several positions I have to wait till it goes away; in many cases to have it return in other places described above. What does it mean; how do I treat it. I have high blood pressure and the meds deplete my potassium so I take a prescription supplement for that. What should I be asking my doctor.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have recently been diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder called IgG4 Sclerosing Disease. I know very little about it and have had multiple surgeries and have seen MANY doctors regarding it. So far none of my doctors have seen anything like it and the only reason I reached this diagnosis was because one of my doctors reached out to a colleague at the MayoClinic in Rochester; MN who has 8 patients with this disease. I just want help understanding it and maybe to reach out and speak to anyone else that has this as well.	2010	2010	26	Female

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	This discussion is related to Sulphuric/ Eggy burps and stomach cramps. hello. Ocationally I have rotten egg burps. Especially a lot in the past couple of days!... at first I thought I might have a gluten allergy; but i can eat products with gluten in them; like bread; but ramen (oodles of noodles) and regular pasta I have problems with. Then I thought it was meat but a garlicy hamburger (which was my testing meat product) resulted in my feeling better. So I started to think maybe garlic or onions were the factor that would prevent my tummy from rebelling and so far that has worked. The symptoms are basically evil burps and tummy pain; no diahrehha ever has come with it yet. There were some articles that said it might be because of water that has been contaminated; where other sites support my gluten allergy theory. I have no idea what the problem might be; but I have saw that there were thousands of people who had very similar problems and after a complete GI series nothing; CT scans nothing; numerous blood tests and nothing! this seems to be a mystery problem. I myself have had elevated liver functions in a blood tests but everythign else I've been tested for has come back normal. any thoughts?	2008	2008		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I'm a 43 year old male with a long history of stomach issues. I take prilosec daily and have no idea what a ""normal"" bowel movement resembles. Sour stomach; cramps; reflux and soft stools are just a part of life for me and I've been able to lead a fairly normal and mobile life in spite of these issues. Six weeks ago; I went to work and took one of my kids w/me. He loves going to the office for some reason and he had nothing better to do on this particular summer day. Around 10am I started noticing that I was burping quite a bit and my son pointed out that something smelled like ""rotten eggs"". I agreed that something did smell putrid and that it was in fact my burps. As the day continued; the burps became more and more frequent with individual burps lasting longer and smelling even worse (if that's possible). Around 3pm; I told my boss I wasn't feeling well and excused myself. I drove to the hospital and the ER was empty. Not a person in sight! Wow! I told the nurse that I was in extreme abdominal discomfort; nauseous and pain radiating toward my back from my stomach region. Well; somehow that triggered the ""high risk heart alert"" which got me checked in in record time; and EKG; blood work; and who knows what else. Eventually they ruled out my heart and I continued to feel incredibly nauseous despite the three doses of anti-nausea medicine they had put in my IV. Once it was brought under control; they did CAT scans; x-rays and sonograms of my abdominal region. They checked everything! They found nothing. My appendix; galbladder; intestines and stomach appeared normal. They gave me two bags of iv antibiotics and lots of fluids via the iv. I just figured it was viral. The next day I checked out and went home having missed a day of work. Three weeks later; I started tasting the rotten egg burps again and about 3 hours later; I was heaving up my guts. I'm one of those people who really; really hates to vomit. I mean; I just wont do it unless there is just no option. I will feel sick longer rather than throw-up. I'd take a beating before willfully throwing up. Anyway; it was an unstoppable force and it just kept coming. My wife took me back to the hospital ER where they again performed many of the same tests which all came up negative. They gave me anti-nausea medicine which worked a bit better this time. Again; after 24 hours; the pain and nausea were gone. Today; September 7; 2003 I'm starting to taste the rotten egg burps. I can't afford to miss work tomorrow but more than that; I cannot afford to spend the night and tomorrow morning going through this hellish experience again. It's just too much. So; here's what I've tried. I took 40mg pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) delayed release tablet and an alka-seltzer. These were 2 of 3 ideas I found on this site. The 3rd idea said to eat a lime or lemon. I have to say; the burps do feel a bit controlled but I'm not ready to claim victory yet. I'll post tomorrow morning and let all know if this worked. God help me if it doesn't because for sure the medical community at large is not able to. All of these posts going back ten years and not a single person has said they have been cured yet? Please; if you have had this problem and have been correctly diagnosed and cured; post a response and let me know. Or; perhaps you have had this issue and know of a means of dulling the symptoms? That would be great too. I just can't believe that after over 40 years of never having anything like this happen; now It has happened 3 times in six weeks. Again; I'll post if my rotten egg burps have not turned into nausea by morning. -Condor301 This discussion is related to Sulphuric/ Eggy burps and stomach cramps."	2008	2008		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I see these comments are from 2006. I am currently having many of these same problems. Tickle in throat; sharp pain; cough; tears; nose dripping. This has been happening for the past 5 months. I've been to a ENT. He said it was my tonsils. I had them out. At first while I was on meds during my recovery from the surgery the symptoms stopped. But after I stopped taking the pain killers anti-biotic and the steroids the tickle came back. I've been taking Previcid for acid reflux but this has not stopped the attacks. Does anyone have any current information on this? This discussion is related to Tickle in throat makes me cough and choke.	2008	2008		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Please I would like some advise on how to control my weight. I have Hashimoto Disease a thyroid disorder. I seemed to grow regularly taking it off is something else. At 54 it isn't getting easier ..*smile*.. Four days a week my husband and I do the basic Pilate stretching exercise for 40 minutes. We also just started walking around the reservoir 4 times a week about a 2 to 2.5 walk. When not able to walk around the reservoir I walk on my walker for 20 minutes a good pace. Food wise; we really eat healthy. Morning we have oatmeal with raisin and cinnamon with milk we do not add sugar or honey. We share a apple and a bannana and we have a tad of cottage cheese on a half tomatoe. Lunch we usually have a sandwich mostly peanut butter n jelly sometimes tuna etc. At night we mostly have a nice fresh salad and our meat dish. Meat us usually baked in the oven on racks or bar-b-que. I rarely go for seconds; we eat off the small dinner plates I think some call them salad plates anyway they are not the saucer size. I've been thinking maybe I should start eating off a saucer. I drink lots of water. Soda Pops; chips; cookies; candies; pie or cake as a whole I do not keep in the house on a regular basis. At night I usually get a sweet tooth ..sigh.. I usually have a half a apple and some dates. Any advice on how to keep my weight down?	2007	2008

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	For the last two weeks my hands (the palms and between my fingers)will begin to itch periodically without warning. When I scrath them it only gets worse; the itching is intensified and they begin to burn. I have tried multiple things to relieve it but to no avail. It starts and stops continully through out the day and there is no one indicator of what might be causing it. I am worried that it might be my liver or gallbladder due to stones in my gallbladder. Or could it be decreased tissue perfussion to my hands? I know just enough to get into trouble and am concered about this due to the fact that I have tried everything and it does not seem to go away. I changed my soaps; lotions; and detergents. I have tried Benadryl and creams applied to the skin; they do not phase the itching. Please help. Thank you	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Since May I have been having severe dizzy or lightheaded feeling like I will pass out; but I don't. Combined with being extremely nauseas and very bad diarrhea. It comes out of nowhere. I could just be sitting at work and an episode will happen. It seems so hard to explain what is happening. First; I will feel a bit dizzy and nauseas; then I will have to run to the bathroom because the diarrhea hits me and I feel like while I'm going to the bathroom I will pass out; then the nausea and dizziness with cold chillls and then I am hot so I have to take the sweater off that I put on because I was cold. I am 30 years old and I have a mild case of lupus that has been under control with plaquinil over the past ten years. My Obgyn took me off of birth control pills in August because she thought that was what was causing this; but I still have the episodes and they are getting closer and closer together. I had an MRA and MRI in September that both came back normal. My neurologist has put me on neurontin three times a day; but that isn't helping either. I can not funtion my normal like and every time it goes away I hope it's for good; but then it comes back and I can not figure out why. I am not drinking any alcohol either. Please give me some advice because I am tired of missing work and time with my family. Thank you.	2005	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I bet Stella knows this (?); but it's also a poll / question for any that have it - so please respond; its a rare question! My question comes up after I was reminded that T3 is converted via the liver on another post. Thyroid is linked with so much other stuff its hard to keep track! I; like many here; might have a T4 to T3 conversion problem that does not show on the lab tests. I dont know how a conversion issue is proven; is there a way? My docs dont seem to know or care about conversion. All I know is I feel somewhat better with T3 in dessicated and I am driven to find out the very reason. Below may or may not be the reason why. I just had a AMA comp panel (physical); and for years my Bilirubin is over the range (double!). Doc always brushes off the high Bilirubin since the other liver tests are OK. This has something to do with the liver and Juandice. My other liver tests (Alkaline Phosphate; AST and ALT) have always been and still are in the middle range; they are OK!. There is a name for this unbalanced condition. My question(s): 1) Does anyone else have high Bilirubin with Hoshi's and have the other liver tests in range? 2) Anyone no what high Bilirubin has to do with the Liver converting T4 to active T3 in a Hoshimoto Hypo person? Thanks; getting educated on this for my next appt if need be. I will admit I don't know much about the liver; but I know enough to take it easy on Tylonel (and booze)! Moose	2009	2009		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have had reoccurant uti like symptoms for a few months..all my cultures show no infection just white blood cells..I've seen a urologist who did a bladder ultrasound and cystoscopy both normal..I saw my gyn who did a pelvic ovaries were normal..he did not give me a ultrasound though..should I persue further testing since this could be a symptom of ovarian cancer? I am 30yr..also I did have a pelvic ultrasound 6 moths ago for something else and my ovaries were normal size.	2002	2003		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	My sister inlaw is a adopting a new born; the mother's didn't have any amniotic fluid for several weeks. The baby is discolored; like a grey look; because it sat in the mother's womb without fluid. Is this normal? The doctor's claim that the baby is healthy. Will the baby get her color back to normal and when? Is there anything we should be aware of about the baby? Would the baby have lived in species? We are very concerned about the newborn. Thank you;	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Has anyone had the Mirena IUD and had it removed to ttc. I am just curious how long it took you to conceive after Mirena IUD removal? How long until your menstrual cylces were regular? I got my IUD out on Aug 5th and am ttc. I have had lots of spotting and maybe a period but nothing regular. I called my doc and they said that it takes 3 months before the hormones are out of your system. The mirena website makes it sound as though you can get pregnant anytime after removal. Any advice/stories would be appreciated. Thanks.	2006	2006		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I am having some symptoms of being pregnant(weight gain; breast swelling and tenderness; mood swings) but I have taken several tests that show negative. Also; for the last 2 months my periods have been at least 4 days late and really light; and I am having discharge throughout the month. I was diagnosed with endometriosis about 3 years ago; but since my surgery none of the dr's have been concerned. I did have abnormal cells show up on a pap; but the biopsy turned out ok. I'm not sure what the problem is; and I have sceduled an appt; but is there anything I can do until then?	2006	2006

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"My husband fell on his penis when he was younger while at a skating ring- he is now 20. Ever since then; he had a indention above his penis. Another symptom is that his penis retracts into his body when his adrenaline gets going. He would literally have to pull it out before it goes all the way in. I have tried looking up these symptoms but only found one thing called ""Penis Panic"" pretty much saying that its a beliefe where men think their penis is going to retract into their body and disapear. Well; this def is not something in his head; lol... really happens. Anyone else heard of this? He went to the doc- the doc is going to call him back cause he doesnt know what it could be.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"It's been almost 2 weeks since my laproscopic surgery; I have learned alot both from experiencing it and talking to ya'll here on the forum. Time to share; because just maybe somebody is about to go through the same thing and has questions or needs help. It would be great if everyone added their two cents and we will have a nice ""what to expect when your expecting laproscopic surgery"" list...lol 1. Don't be fooled; this is major surgery. You could be having body parts removed. Don't plan on doing much for at LEAST a week or two. If you are lucky like some; you'll be up and at 'em. But if you're not; then you won't be disappointed and frustrated. 2. Make or buy muffins. Especially bran. You will need them. Don't ask me why. Ok...why? Because your meds will constipate you and make your stomach hurt. AND you will be too tired to make food. You can buy stool softeners too; but they don't make for a tasty breakfast... 3. If you can; shop for or prepare food and stick it in the freezer. And be REALLY REALLY nice to your friends and neighbors before your surgery. They may offer to bring you food. Don't be silly; say yes. You will be glad you did! 4. The CO2 gas may bloat you up. It might not happen for a day or two and you will laugh and say ""I am SO lucky!!"" and then ""POP"" You are the now the Pilsbury doughgirl. Only not as cute. But it hurts...not just the shoulder; could be all over. WALK; WALK; WALK.. around the house; it will go away. Could take a week or more; but the worst is the first few days. Try beano; mylanta; etc. too. BEST cure: Massage. Takes away all the toxins; pushes out some gas. Can't get one?... be REALLY REALLY nice to your spouse; significant other; children; whoever.... they may take pity on poor ol' bloated you and help you out. 5. Get one of those beanybag things that you put in the microwave. Put it on where it hurts. Warm feels nice and you can't get in the tub for two weeks. Your body might hurt all over. They say they don't drop you off the stretcher while you are unconscious; but I personally don't believe it... 6. Enjoy your downtime. Remember all those busy days you wished you could lie around; play on the computer; read books; organize your photos; google your old boyfriend; write that novel? Well; do it. Or sleep. Or both. 7. Sleep. Sleep some more. 8. Driving sucks. Try and avoid it until your incisions/stomach muscles don't hurt. (and you're not on happypills anymore...) It's illegal in most states to drive lying down; I believe... 9. Drink lots of water. Flushes out all the stuff they pumped into you during surgery. Fluffs out the sleep wrinkles in your face.. 10. Get on this forum when you can. You will find wonderful women with supportive notes; messages; laughs; and you can read others stories to know whether you are ""normal"" or not (in terms of your surgery - if you want deeper analysis; try the psych forum...) That's MY top ten; I hope you all can add a few of your own! Thanks everyone for ALL your help; info; and especially the friendship and laughter. Have a great day! Joelle"	2008	2008	47	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I wondered if anyone who had had a laparoscopy could tell me how long it hurt for. I still feel quite alot of pain when walking after a week and wondered if that is normal; as everywhere I read that people resume normal activities after a couple of days. I am not doubled up or anything; its just like having a constant stitch; and when i take a step; especially around my belling button there is a kind of sharp tugging pain. Also some stabbing pains too that just seem to happn even when sitting still. Just wanted to know if this is usual; I expcet it is; but thought I would ask others who had had similar; who might tell me how long until the abdomen feels normal again. Thanks	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Two weeks ago around 6pm I had an episode of multiple symptoms that precipitated very quickly; within about three minutes; without warning. These included feeling very weak; shaking all over; light headed/dizzy;numbness/tingling on fingertips and toes; slight shortness of breath and chill. I felt like passing out; flushed. I figured it was from not eating so I grabbed a burger and it seemed to alleviate the problems. Well; it happened again around the same time of day a few days later. But this time; eating didn't help as much. Eventually the symptoms went away. My colleagues observed that I looked very pale. Since then; I have been experiencing episodes every day in the evening. I keep a pile of energy bars in the office and gulp one down at the very first hint of weakness; shaking; which seems to go away in about ten minutes. If I don't; the symptoms quickly intensify until I am so shaky and weak that I can't remain in a sitting position. I've had blood/urine test and was told all is ok. Here's the curious part. Last two days; instead of gulping down an energy bar; I've been taking Vitamin B-12 that dissolves under the tongue. This seems to help alleviate the symptoms as well as the energy bar. Any thoughts or guesses on this will be gratefully appreciated. Thank you	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi For several months I have been getting this weird sensation that my skin is crawling. This happens just behind my right shoulder blade in exactly the same place every time. It generally happens for no reason that I can fathom. It is a sort of itching sensation and then a sensation that there is something crawling under my skin. When I rub it with my fingers it disappears for a while but inevitably it returns within a few minutes. There is no pain involved. Would be interested to find out if there is a medical explanation for this! Many thanks Lola	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just started Topamax. I'm on 25mg/day and will increase by 25mg/week until I reach 100mg. I heard the weightloss effect depends on the dose. So; what dose did everyone here have their success? And what type of diet/eating plan and exercise plan did you do to help it along? I'm desperate to lose 40 lbs (half of which I gained on Zoloft-no longer taking). PLEASE respond if you had any weightloss on this drug; I'm very curious. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! :)	2006	2006		Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I was scheduled to get my period on July 22 or 23. on those 23rd I assumed I was getting my period because I start out with a brown discharge. But the that discharge is still here. When I wipe after going to bathroom sometimes the discharge is light on toilet tissue and sometimes I will get very light blood. I still have this discharge and I know if it was to be my period it should be over by now. Could I be pregnant. I took a pregnancy test last Monday and it came back negative but I don't have no signs of being pregnant either. Should I want til it stops and hope for a period next month; take a pregnancy test; or go to the doctor. This has never happened before. I don't know what this is. Hope someone can tell me.	2003	2005		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; I have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am 25 & am on Prednisone(60mg);salasapyrin(500mg)& Plaquenil(200mg) per day. I have developed a large moon shaped face. I am swollen in the face & neck & hate what it is doing to my face. Will this swelling & fluid go away when I come off the steroids in five weeks? It is causing me to be depressed & family have noticed the change in my face & are worried for my health. I have heard some scary things about these drugs; prednisone in particular. Please is there anything that can stop the Moon face & would I benefit from taking a dieretic too?? P.s I have had an eye twitch every day for the last 3 dys in my left eye; lasting for approx 20secs & about every 10 mins? Could this b another side effect & should I worry about it as it is annoying & starting to get sore? Thanks	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi! It's my first time posting--hello everyone! Just have a question that someone might be able to help with... Ever since I got married I have had a VERY regular 28 day menstrual cycle--never late; never early. We are trying to get pregnant; and today I am at least five to six days late for my period. I did a pregnancy test this morning that came up negative. How reliable is that result since I usually have such a normal cycle? I don't have any other symptoms besides frequent urination and butterflies in my stomach that could just be from the excitement of the whole situation. So I guess my question is whether or not it is ""worth it"" to take another pregnancy test; if so; when; or; what else could even be the cause of such a delay in my usually predictable period? Thanks for any comments; etc! Katie L."	2003	2003		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Over a week ago for absolutely no identifiable reason my heart started skipping way more beats than usual. I can go hours with none and then have several hours where I'll have 2 or 3 a minute. It's setting me over the edge. I don't know if it's dangerous or not. I went to the ER the other day and they basically didn't care at all and just had me take Ativan and sent me home. Today I panicked and called the paramedics who came and did a 12 lead and they said normal sinus with one ectopic and so I didn't go back to the ER. I had a normal echo 3 years ago. I already don't eat caffeine or sugar. Please reassure or sympathize with me. I'm going insane and have no idea what's causing this out of the blue. Why would they suddenly increase for no reason whatsoever?	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I'm a 35 year old male from the UK in otherwise good health. About 3 months ago I started having some weird symptoms/sensations. Firstly; I noticed a slight tremor in my left thumb; it only lasted a few seconds and I put this down to fatigue; as I'd been working out with weights. For some weeks after this my left hand felt tired and shakey; but without any loss of strength or actually shaking. I then started to experience intermitant sensations of what I can only describe as light numbness and pins and needles in both my hands and feet; but primarily on my left sided extremeties.I would also occassionaly get these sensations on a small area of my left thigh.These sensations regularly come and go; but last seconds rather than minutes/hours. In recent weeks the light numbness seems to have subsided but I have noticed that I regularly wake up during the night with either hand completely numb.This is rectified in seconds by wiggling my fingers; but the effected hand is left feeling weak for a couple of hours.I have also noticed a strange buzzing sensation under my left foot; that I can only describe as if someone was holding vibrating mobile phone against it. I have been to see my GP who seems to think stress or anxiety.Basic blood tests have come back normal. I apologise for the length of this post; but I would much appreciate any thoughts or advice as the where I go now. 1)does anybody know; statistically; how likely these symptoms are to be caused by some serious disorder ie ms. 2)Does stress/anxiety seem a feesible cause. 3)These symptoms are very light and the worry of what they might be is causing much more of a problem than the actual sensations. With this in mind; do you think it might be better to just live with these things and see if they die down of their own accord. Many thanks in advance.	2007	2007		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I just had my HSG done last week (after 19 months of ttc). She said the tubes were clear.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"There are several of us on here who have a similar eye complaint: seeing a bright flash; like the afterimage of a flash bulb; when we blink; and sometimes; on upgaze. This is transient symptom for most of us; lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. When the ""spot"" in our visual field passes over a dark background; the spot appears light. When the spot passes over a light background; it appears dark. So far; the doctors haven't been able to diagnose us; and perhaps that means it is simply some idiopathic phenomenon. But; in any case; I'm wondering what other similarities we might all have that could bring us closer to a an explanation. For instance; other factors about me which might be clues are: I take 100 mg of Zoloft a day I would describe myself as high-anxiety and stress I clench my teeth; usually on the same side as the effected eye I have alot of sinus problems around my eyes I have double vision due to a weak muscle in one eye I have many floaters and one very prominent one in the eye without the bright spot How about you?"	2008	2008		Male
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hello; I have had many signs of pregnancy like; swollen and tender boobs; stomach cramps on the left side; constant diziness and a few light headaches. My last period started on May 13th and I started on June 12th with a very light period. I typically have very heavy periods and this time it is light. I have read all about Implantation bleeding and not sure if that is what I am going thru. I have heard many things and not sure which to believe. I have heard to wait 2 weeks after i stop bleeding to take a test; some say ok to test while bleeding and others say to wait a few days after I stop. Im not really trying to get pregnant but I would be happy if I was. Anyone have any advice? My periods have never been regular but my husband and I are stressed wondering if i am pregnant. Im thinking it wont hurt to test now while bleeding; in a few days after i stop and then maybe again in a few weeks. Thank you for all your help.	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"Hi; I'm Quix. This is my story of finally getting a diagnosis of MS. If you have been worked up for MS and have a diagnosis - Whatever that dianosis is - Would you post below and add your story? Thank you. I am a 55 year old; white female. Seven years ago I was hit by intractable vertigo and; despite being treated by one of the world's foremost experts in vertigo; was forced to retire from being a pediatrician. I had very complicated problems in the inner ear on the left. But; eventually the problems spread to my right ear also. I was diagnosed with Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease. I was almost bedridden for a good portion of the first 4 years suffering from daily dizziness; nausea; poor balance with a lot of falls; and the worst fatigue I had ever sufferd. Remember I had trained in a huge county hospital and regularly spent 36 hours straight on my feet. The fatigue with vertigo is worse!! Two and a half years ago one morning I was putting on my shoes and socks and realized I couldn't lift my R leg onto the other to put on my socks. I could barely lift it off the ground. I saw my internist who noted pathologically hyperactive reflexes on both knees and ankles; weakness of the R hip flexors and referred me to the neurologist I had seen before for migraines. The neurologist who I already knew thought I was a crock; examined me and found mild extensor spasticity in my right leg - mainly at the hip. He sent me for an MRI w and w/o contrast of my brain and spine. Next visit he said the MRI's were completely normal. There was an UBO (Unidentified Bright Object) in the brain; but that this was inconsequential. He said it definitely wasn't MS and that I was too old for it anyway. He sent me home. Dx Vertigo and Spasticity- mild. Later I discovered in his notes that he thought I was faking the weakness. During the next year I was dieting and lost 50 pounds slowly; but developed intermittent urinary incontinence. (losing weight is supposed to help that!) I also became much more fatigued than I was before; but wrote that off to being so deconditioned by spending all day in my recliner. Also; after years of living in the desert; became severely sensitive to even mild heat in my apartment. It made me weak and irrationally irritable. I was trying to get in short daily walks. One day it was a little warmer than usual and I couldn't make it home due to sudden weakness in both legs. I was terrified; and a neighbor had to help me home. Some months later I had a couple weeks of a weird sensation of warm water running down my right thigh. It would happen off and on all during the day. Each time I was sure I was being incontinent; but nothing was there! I went back to the neuro a year after he had seen me before. He repeated the MRI and did the complete battery of blood tests for the causes of myelopathy (disease of brain and spinal cord) Again the MRI was normal and so were all the blood tests. He appeared annoyed by my return to see him. He called me and asked ""if I WANTED a spinal tap."" This was implying that I was faking the problems and just wanted to get medical procedures. Yeah; right... Last summer (2006) suddenly one day I could not lift my right arm even to touch my throat. It was completely useless for about 36 hours; got a little better over the next week; but still felt weak and so fatigued. When I tried to use my right hand it felt foreign as if I was trying to use someone else's hand. It slowly improved over the next couple months. Even so I was left with residual weakness at the shoulder. Meanwhile I'm dragging my right leg; because it never got better and lurching about like a drunk sailor. So tired that I stopped leaving the house. My sister came to live with me; because I could not handle the house and errands. I became seriously depressed. It was several months before I could get my mental strength and courage to research my own problems. My self-esteem was non-existent. By the end of 2006 I knew the only neurological disease that fit my symptoms of weakness; spasticity; parathesias; bladder problems; fatigue; heat intolerance; and the now two attacks of problems that came; stayed and then slowly resolved was MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. All the other possible entities had been ruled out (this is critical in the daignosis of MS if the findings aren't perfectly classic) The problem was that my MRI was normal and I was too old at 54. You can suspect MS; but you cannot diagnose it without at least 1 brain or spine lesion on MRI. I went to the MS Society website and looked for MS specialists in my area. I found one; made an appointment and my GP was very agreeable to making a referral. The new neurologist was wonderful! Intense; smart and thorough. In retrospect he made the diagnosis of MS on that first visit. He stated that calling the spot on my MRI a UBO was laughable. It was classic for an MS plaque (well-circumscribed; oval; perpendicular to the ventricles ). He was also stunned that my other neuro had not pushed hard for a spinal tap. That is the next step when the MRI is not diagnostic. He prescribed Provigil for the fatigue (miracle drug for me) and repeated another MRI of brain and spine. He also ordered the spinal tap which I had under fluoroscopy guidance. It was absolutely painless and without complications. Those MRI's didn't show any definite new lesions; but he was very suspicious of two little areas on my cervical spine. The tap was positive for an elevated IgG index and I had only one (of course) oligoclonal band. They like to see 2 or more. The cell count was lost! Based on a physical exam which showed a huge amount of existing spinal cord disease; a single plaque on my brain; the normal blood work up for myelopathy; and suggestive findings on the spinal tap he made the diagnosis of MS. He said it wasn't a ""slam-dunk"" diagnosis; but he was at least 90% sure. He; and many opther experts in the field; feel that for many people the MRI machines are just not sensitive enough. They improve every year or two. His concern was than in just 2 years; I was already very disabled. I've had intensive physical therapy and still required a brace on my R leg and I need to use a cane. The disease was/is progressing fast. He put me in the category of Relapsing Remitting only because if I had a progressive type I should have many; many more brain lesions; but my disease is acting more like the rarest type called Progressive Relapsing. In my reading late onset MS is often marked by faster progression of disability and more by motor dysfunction than by sensory problems. This fits with what I have had. So this was my short course to diagnosis. Not nearly as horrific as it has been for many of you; but it has been devastating to me. The scary loss of function; the not knowing why; and the anger at being dismissed and discarded by my doctor. Ya know; the vertigo had been quite enough.... I'm now two months into therapy with Avonex. I'm through a new relapse (my fourth in the 30 months). A repeat MRI of my C-spine and T-spine with one of the newest generation of MRI machines which has a more powerful (3 Tesla) magnet showed half a dozen old spinal lesions which were missed by the previous older machines. I'm having constant electric shocks down my left leg when I flex my neck. Dozens of times a day. It's called L'Hermitte's Sign; and it is common in MS; but new to me. It is felt to indicate upper spine lesions that press on normal nerves when the neck is flexed. So I; too; am a Stanger in a Strange Land. I hope that here on the forums I can learn from you and share some of my understanding of how things work from 23 years in medical practice. Quix"	2006	2007	55	Female
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi guys!! I am so afraid this is what I am going through.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"I am having extremely debilitating anxiety right now. Mild chest discomfort but I focus in on it so much that it becomes unbearable. I am always aware of my heartbeat and like above I focus in to it where it just drives me insane. I am expereincing undescribable levels of discomfort and I just dont understand whats wrong with me. My heart rate throughout the day is 90-100 bpm resting; and it shoots up even when I do simple tasks such as walking. Ive been to a cardiologist and they did several tests and said everything was there and in working order but my pictures were ""blurry"" so that definately just increased my anxiety 10 fold. A long with this; I was told to wear a hear monitor for a month which did nothing except increase it even more; and I did not even wear the monitor in the end. The strangest symptons though are just constant vibrations or movements in my intestinal area; bad heart burn; bad gas; and a feeling like I have to burp but just cant. Im hoping that my heart is fine and the feelings are just from my focusing on it too much; but I just dont know. Can anyone relate to this?

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"For years I have been ""suffering"" from excessive dreaming. I have dreams that are extremely graphic; detailed and vivid. Most of the time I am aware that I am dreaming and cannot wake up. It does not occur every night; but several nights a week. I wake up feeling EXAUSTED. I nod off during the day; cannot keep my eyes open. Last night (for example) I got 8 hours of sleep and yet today I'm so tired I could cry! I should also mention that I fall asleep almost instantly and I dream as soon as I fall out. There are some days where I ""fall asleep"" here at work and begin to dream instantly; it's almost as if It's an instant hallucination. My husband says I'm lucky to fall asleep when I hit the pillow but I'm to the point where if sleeping makes me THIS tired I don't want to. The dreams are often traumatic and I'm tired anyway. What's the point of sleeping?! I'm not suffering from depression and I have a regular schedule in terms of sleep (Usually get at least 6.5 - 8.5 hours a sleep). My diet is pretty good and I get an average amount of excersize. Everything I do is in moderation (no drugs either; btw). Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this? Why am I dreaming so much and why do I feel exhausted after a ""good"" nights sleep? Perplexed; Ms.April"	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Can a Vitamin D deficiency cause this much pain? Went to the doc for muscle pain & weakness with increasing shooting pains to the point of affecting everyday functioning. Blood test came back low in Vitamin D. Result was 11; (should be 26 to 55). Other results OK. Cervical Spine & lower back MRI OK. Treatment is 50;000 units of D per week for 4 weeks and thereafter once a month. Been on it for 4 months. Feel at times like I was in accident.Have researched on the net; and still find it difficult to believe that this can cause this much suffering. Anyone familiar with anything like this?	2006	2006		
Metformin+diabetes+type+2	"A Strong Woman VS. A Woman Of Strength A strong woman works out everyday to keep her body in shape… But a woman of strength builds relationships to keep her soul in shape. A strong woman isn't afraid of anything… But a woman of strength shows courage in the midst of fear. A strong woman won't let anyone get the better of her… But a woman of strength gives the best of herself to everyone. A strong woman makes mistakes and avoids the same in the future… A woman of strength realiizes life's mistakes can also be unexpected blessings and capitalizes on them. A strong woman wears a look of confidence on her face… But a woman of strength wears grace. A strong woman has faith that she is strong enough for the journey… But a woman of strength has faith that it is in the journey that she will become strong.

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	I have experienced on 4 occasions in the last 6 years a rather weird Diarrhoea attack which really is painful and scary. Here is a description of what occurs. 1. Sudden abdominal pain which increases in intensity over a short time. The same sensation one might get when they are about to get Diarrhoea. 2. I go to the toilet and try excreting whatever wants to come out. However after about a minute of sitting there with nothing coming out I suddenly few light headed and am starting to get a dizzy spell like I am about to faint and my breathing weakens. 3. This borderline fainting sensation lasts for about another minute before I break out into a sudden sweat all over my body. Within a few seconds I have sweat literally pouring out of me; my clothes are wet as if I ran a marathon or something. 4. After a minute of sweating I suddenly feel something coming out of my rear end. I try to squeeze it out and only a hard stool comes out. 5. The sweating stops and the stomach cramp subsides. I think everything is over and I clean up. I walk out of the toilet and in about 2 minutes time the stomach cramp and the fainting sensation comes back (I've fainted only once to date from this and was out for about 15-20 minutes). 6. When I get back to the toilet I have a really violent Diarrhoea episode in pure liquid state. It takes a few minutes to subside and once I	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	Hi; for about a year now i have had this fizzing sound in my neck that occurs randomly; usually when i am just laying down. It doesnt occur when i am moving my head or anything; its usually just when i sitting still or laying down. It sounds like it is coming directly from the back of my neck and is starting to worry me. I also experience these weird pains in my head that come for about a second and then go and come back again every 10minutes or so. These pains are in 1 area in the back of my head in about a 1 square inch area.. Any ideas???	2007	2007

Metformin+diabetes+type+2	In May I began to have dizzy spells which coincided with a sore throat and earache; which cleared up on their own. However; dizziness and fatigue continued for several weeks. The dizziness resembled being carsick; with lightheadedness and occasional moments of nausea and feeling faint (but I never passed out). I had a CAT scan and blood work twice; and so far no diagnosis for the dizziness/fatigue. It got better for a few weeks but last week I began to have dizzy spells again; this time accompanied by maxillary sinus pressure. I had just switched allergy medications; from Nasonex to generic Flonase; right at the time my symptoms returned. Could allergies have led to a sinus infection? Can the sinus infection cause dizziness and fatigue? Due to the holiday weekend I haven't been able to call my doctor; but after 3 prior visits he's never suggested sinuses to be a cause.	2006	2006
